I renovated the house during the time I’ve lived in it, and I have LOVED the process.)"

3841,229,Paycheck (Weekly),"$1,259. My husband and I do not share a bank account; we keep our personal expenses separate, so aside from household expenses and travel, we don't really keep tabs on each other. What works for us is for him to auto-pay our bills from his account and for me to pay him twice a month — the first of the month for the mortgage, and around the 15th for electric, cable, internet, water, and groceries. I do all of the grocery shopping and pay for it with an AmEx that is in my name but is his account, that he pays for. As for dining out, he typically pays for the more expensive meals and I pay for the less expensive ones (unless I offer beforehand or it is a special occasion)."
