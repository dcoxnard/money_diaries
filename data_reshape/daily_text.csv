"9 a.m. — I get to sleep in a bit this morning because, although it's Monday, my boyfriend B. and I are in Switzerland visiting my parents, and our flight back to Dublin isn't until later tonight. I read a little of my current book, by Anthony Bourdain, to start the morning. 10 a.m. — After a quick breakfast of eggs and avocado on toast for me and cereal for B., I cuddle with my dog for a bit. She's about 14 years old (we adopted her, so we aren't 100% sure of her age) and her health is failing fast, so I am very aware that this might be the last time I get to see her. She has been a big part of all our lives, and I'm really going to miss her. 12:30 p.m. — My mother, brother, B., and I go out for lunch before we have to drag ourselves to the airport. Mom treats us to an Indian feast of onion bhajis, raita, samosas, various curries, rice, and naan bread — her treat! 1:30 p.m. — We get to the airport, go through security, and head over the the business lounge, which B. has access to (with a plus one), thanks to all his business travel. They have a very well-stocked free bar in this one, which I take full advantage of, and by the time we head to our gate two hours later, I have to admit, I'm a little tipsy. I have a fear of flying, and unfortunately, alcohol is the only thing that calms me down. I stop by Duty-free to buy a bag of chocolates for my office ($12.30). After rough turbulence kicks in mid-flight, I order wine on the plane ($10.30). $22.60 6:45 p.m. — We land back in Dublin and grab a taxi home. B. pays. 7 p.m. — Time to restock the fridge. We head to the supermarket below our apartment and pick up diced turkey, Greek yogurt, cherry tomatoes, grapefruit juice, two small flavored waters, cauliflower, broccoli, red onions, green beans, mushrooms, rice crackers, asparagus, pickles, watermelon, a lemon, microwave lasagna (for B.'s lunch), tissues, and toilet paper. $72.50 8 p.m. — Despite the grocery haul, we're both tired and not in the mood to cook, so we decide to order Japanese. I get salmon nigiri, pork gyoza, and a small side portion of egg fried noodles. B. gets chicken Katsu curry. He pays. 11 p.m. — After two episodes of and an episode of , we're ready to call it an early night. B. has to travel to Dusseldorf for a business trip tomorrow, so he packs while I get ready for bed. My evening routine consists of washing my face, cleaning with micellar water, applying toner and moisturizer, brushing my teeth, and heading to sleep. Daily Total: $95.10",1,0
"7:30 a.m. — B. wakes me up and helps encourage me out of bed. I'm really not a morning person, so it's always a struggle. As I finally step out of bed, B. is ready to leave. We say goodbye, and I finish getting dressed, apply my basic makeup (concealer, powder, eyebrow gel, mascara, and a little lip color), and head out the door. 8:30 a.m. — Get to the office, make myself a coffee with almond milk from the office coffee machine, and get started on my emails. I work in the hospitality industry, which never sleeps, so Monday mornings are always an exercise in playing catch-up. Since I was off yesterday, I'm even further behind. My angel of a coworker made Christina Tosi's chocolate chip cookies, so I have two and call it breakfast. No shame — they are AMAZING. 1:10 p.m. — The morning flies by — I'm so busy! It's lunchtime now, though, so I head home. I live a six-minute walk from the office, and I really enjoy taking my lunch break at home to really get away from it all for an hour. Plus, I save a lot of money on food this way. I cook the diced turkey and mushrooms I bought last night, add sun-dried tomato paste and cottage cheese to make a sauce, and boil pasta to go with it. 5:30 p.m. — The rest of the afternoon is a blur of emails, calls, reports, and meetings. I actually leave on time today though (for once), because I have an appointment to get to. 6 p.m. — Today is my first assessment with a CBT professional. I have a lot of anxieties and really need to get my fear of flying under control in a healthy way, so this is long overdue. After the appointment, I'm a little apprehensive about the process, but I want to give it a real honest try, so I book another appointment for next week. The assessment costs $52 but I don't have to pay until after the next appointment. 8 p.m. — Time for my Zumba class! I hate the gym, really, but this Zumba class doesn't feel like work. It's so fun! 9:15 p.m. — As tired as I am now, I feel amazing! I really love to dance and I'm always proud of myself for getting my shit together and going to class (something that I have, prior to this class, never been able to do). I don't stick to things for long, so this is a big deal for me. When I get home, I eat lunch leftovers for dinner. B. calls afterwards and we chat for 20 minutes until he heads to bed. 10:30 p.m. — Zumba days always tire me out, so after two episodes of (I'm still catching up) and an old rerun of , I'm ready for bed. I go through my normal evening routine of washing, toning, and moisturizing and brushing my teeth, and am out by 11. Daily Total: $0",2,0
"8 a.m. — I've snoozed three alarms, but I have to obey to the fourth. Whenever B. is out of town, I struggle even more, and my whole morning routine is totally thrown off. After losing my keys, water bottle, earbuds, and phone, and forgetting to lock the front door and having to run back. Then, I'm finally off and on my way to work. 8:40 a.m. — Arrive at the office, make a coffee with almond milk from the office kitchen, settle in at my desk, and get right to work. I wish I could put together a to-do list for my day, but I am always at the mercy of my inbox and the phone. My job is 50% actual marketing strategy and implementation, and 50% putting out fires and answering client queries. We do a lot more than marketing at my company, and although I work on the marketing team, my job extends much further than that. I'm expected to know about and help out with other departments, so there is never a dull moment and always a whole lot to learn. 10 a.m. — I'm feeling hungry, so I pour a bowl of granola brought from home with almond milk from the office fridge and eat at my desk. I usually eat breakfast late, since I don't get very hungry early in the morning. 1:10 p.m. — I pull myself away from my screen to head home and eat lunch. I stop off quickly at the supermarket and get radishes and fresh tarragon. At home I make a salad with radish, watermelon, mint, and pine nuts from Jamie Oliver's cookbook. I thought I had feta left, but I guess I only imagined it, so I substitute feta in the salad for cottage cheese I have on hand, and it works just fine. $2.30 4 p.m. — I've been feeling a little run down since Monday evening, which I attribute to the stress of being back at work, but it has persisted and now it's getting noticeably worse. I make an echinacea tea and plan to stop by the pharmacy on my way home. 6:30 p.m. — Call it a day and head home. I stop by the pharmacy and get cold and flu medicine ($10), and then quickly pop into the supermarket for tortellini (I can't be bothered to cook tonight) and two small green juices ($7.56). $17.56 7 p.m. — I make the tortellini and watch more of . B. calls and we chat, but he has a lot of work to catch up on, so our call is brief. 9:30 p.m. — This run-down feeling is getting the best of me, and after my usual evening routine, I head straight to bed and am asleep by 10. I have a busy weekend ahead of me and really don't want to miss out. Daily Total: $19.86",3,0
"4:30 a.m. — I wake up from a vivid nightmare in a cold sweat and can't go back to sleep right away. Usually B. is beside me to offer comfort and cuddles, but this morning I have to self-soothe. I put on an episode of the podcast and end up falling back asleep around 5:15. 7:50 a.m. — I get up after my third alarm, text with B. a little, and roll out of bed. My skin is really dry from lack of sleep, so I choose to just put on a little mascara today with my toner and moisturizer. I get dressed and head out the door. 8:30 a.m. — Get to work. I'm barely at my desk for 10 minutes and I have to head into a meeting. B. texts me that he's boarding his flight back home and I wish him a safe one. 10 a.m. — Out of the meeting and I need food. Our office coffee machine is broken, so I drink one of the green juices I bought yesterday and pour a bowl of granola with almond milk from the office fridge. 1:10 p.m. — Time for lunch. I walk home and make another recipe from the cookbook — this time asparagus, soft-boiled eggs, tarragon, and a red onion mustard vinaigrette. I have a lot of cookbooks, and I love to cook and try new things, so this year I have set myself the goal of cooking at least three new recipes every week from my books. Doing well so far! 6:15 p.m. — A big group from work is going out for drinks tonight and they're trying to encourage me to come, but I think it's best I stay home tonight. I feel serious FOMO, but I know this is the right move, plus I haven't spent time with B. since Monday, and I'm going out with friends this weekend. I pull myself away from my computer and walk home in the warm evening sun. 7 p.m. — B. decides we'll order Japanese again, and I'm happy to oblige. I get four salmon nigiri and a salmon avocado roll, and he orders pork dumplings and chicken katsu. He pays. 8 p.m. — I decide to play a little Sims 4, which I recently got as a gift and started playing again. I spend most of the time designing houses and I love with it — it's a great distraction. I also watch the rest of on the side, and am ready for bed around 9:30. I need a good night's sleep to really shake this cold. Same evening routine and straight to bed. Asleep by 10:30. Daily Total: $0",4,0
"8 a.m. — Finally pull myself out of bed after four alarms, thanks to a surprising fifth in the form of my sister calling. She lives in Australia, so it's hard to find a good time to talk that isn't really early in the morning or super late at night. It's good to hear from her, and we chat while I get ready for work. 8:20 a.m. — Walk to work with B. this morning and get right to answering emails when I get to my desk. 9:30 a.m. — I definitely need coffee, and our office coffee machine is still out of order, so I pop over to a cafe around the corner with a colleague and get a large latte with almond milk. $4.05 10:40 a.m. — I've been so busy that I forgot to eat breakfast. I pour a small bowl of granola with almond milk and eat at my desk. 1 p.m. — Every Friday there's a street food market near our office. I go there with a colleague and get an avocado, black bean, and plantain arepa with yucca fries from one of my favorite stalls. On the way to the market though, a colleague pulls me aside to let me know she's leaving her job. I'm crushed. Our team is small and we're all close, so it hits hard. We are an understaffed division, underpaid for what we do, and the workload is very demanding, so I'm not surprised to hear the news. This job is an amazing learning experience, which is why I'm still here, but the way the company is run is starting to get to me. $12 5:50 p.m. — We are allowed to leave at 5 on Fridays, but I have a lot to finish before the weekend, so I get out a little later than I'd like. I meet B. at the supermarket to get a bottle of wine and Quorn Swedish meatballs for dinner. He pays. Once home, I open the bottle, pour a small glass, and continue designing my dream apartment on the Sims. I need an escape from today... 7 p.m. — B .cooks up the Quorn meatballs and couscous with red pesto, which we eat for dinner in front of the last episode of . Then we peruse Netflix and iTunes for something new to watch, but can't settle on anything, so I decide to draw up a bath instead, pop in a Lush bath bomb (my kryptonite), and go for a soak. There really is nothing better after such a long and stressful day. 10 p.m. — Bath over, and I think it's time to call it a night. Wash my face with micellar water, use toner and moisturizer, brush my teeth, and tuck myself into bed. I read a little more and fall asleep after a few pages. Daily Total: $16.05",5,0
"9:30 a.m. — I slept really well last night and wake up feeling refreshed. Read more of and watch some videos on YouTube videos on my phone in bed before getting up. 10 a.m. — I take a shower and get ready for the day. I am meeting my friend, S., for brunch this morning and also to pick up our numbers for a 10k we're walking tomorrow. I leave the house and take the tram into the city using my prepaid travel card. 12 p.m. — I hop off the tram and run into another mutual friend, A., so I invite her to join us for brunch. I order a cauliflower and halloumi fritter with bacon, poached eggs, micro greens, and beet whipped ricotta, plus a flat white with oat milk. $20.50 2 p.m. — As we're picking up our numbers, A. decides to join us for the 10k tomorrow too (it's a charity run for women). The more the merrier — I'm really looking forward to it! At the check-in, I spot a sports store booth with big discounts on sneakers. I've been looking for new ones and spot a pair of Nike running shoes on sale, so I snag them. After we pick up our numbers, we part ways and I head home on the tram with my prepaid card again. $62.50 5 p.m. — I snack on watermelon and rice crackers whilst getting ready for tonight. A friend and I are going to RuPaul's Werq the World Tour, and I can't wait!! I am a huge fan of the show —  obsessed even. I've seen every season at least twice. I bought the tickets for myself and a friend, who is just as big a fan as I am, for Christmas, and have been counting down the days ever since! 7 p.m. — We meet up ahead of time for a drink. I buy the first round, a pint of Guinness for me and an alcohol-free Paulaner for him. He gets the second round, although I only order a half pint of Guinness this time. I don't want to drink too much tonight before the race tomorrow. $11.40 8:30 p.m. — We make our way over to the venue and I get popcorn to snack on during the show. $5.83 11 p.m. — The show was amazing. It was so cool to see all the queens live and in person! We go our separate ways afterwards and I stick around a little to see if I can catch any of them leaving the venue. No luck, but I do make friends with the couple standing next to me and we end up taking the tram together. I use my prepaid travel card. I'm happy to have company and not to have to make the trip home alone so late at night. I get home just before 1 a.m., chat with B. for a little about the show, and head to bed. Daily Total: $100.23",6,0
"10 a.m. — Sleep in a little this morning and get up slowly after a little cuddle with B. I decide to make another cookbook recipe of poached eggs with mushrooms, spinach, and truffle oil on toast. I don't have spinach, so I substitute for asparagus and pull toast out of the freezer. I poach my eggs but quickly realize something is very wrong with them. As I try to figure out how they got so weirdly spongy and bubbly, I burn my toast. Not a great start to the morning. I give up on my fancy breakfast and instead defrost protein banana bread from the freezer and eat a slice. I also make a coffee from our Nespresso machine. 12:30 p.m. — I get changed, put a few essentials into a bag, and I'm off into town to meet my friends for the race! The tram is PACKED, but I manage to squeeze in and use my prepaid travel card. I also happen to be on the same one as A. (whose birthday is today), so it makes meeting up that much easier. Race starts at 2, but we have to be at the starting line at 1:30. We find S. and we're off! 4 p.m. — We made it! The weather was beautiful and the ambiance was amazing, plus we did it in great time! We collect our goodie bags and medals, snap a few pics, and part ways. We're meeting up later to celebrate A.'s birthday, but first, I need to put my feet up for a bit. 8 p.m. — After a shower at home and chill time watching , I get dressed, put on makeup, and dash out the door again to meet the girls. My travel card needs to be topped up, so I do that now. $12 9 p.m. — We have dinner at a fun hibachi restaurant and it is all the riot I expected it to be. Our chef is hilarious, and since we are just three people, he gets us to talk with the people seated beside us. We all have a good laugh. We get beef, prawns, duck, fried rice, veggies, and two bottles of wine. We split the bill evenly between the three of us. $49.10 11 p.m. — Now it's time for drinks! Over to a Mexican bar/restaurant just down the road for margaritas and dancing. We each get our own first drinks, and then I get a round for everyone. (S.'s birthday is next weekend and she won't be here, so this is my chance to get her a birthday drink, too.) $46.80 2:30 a.m. — A. lives near me, so we get a taxi home together and split it. I've never been happier to crawl into bed. It has been a long day, and I know I'll feel it tomorrow, but nevertheless, I'm one happy fish. $14 Daily Total: $121.90",7,0
"9 a.m. — Wake up. Brush my teeth. Re-curl beach waves in my hair. Get dressed. Grab my German Shepherd that goes to work with me everyday, kiss the BF, and hit the road. 11:30 a.m. — I have a huge presentation in two days to present to the city for new construction lofts, and, unfortunately, all my presentation boards came as posters by mistake! I'm supposed to be able to present these to city council on easels. Trying to create a plan B. HAPPY MONDAY. 1 p.m. — I have some apple slices with a salad of shredded chicken, kale, cucumbers, broccoli, and Trader Joe's cilantro dressing. 3 p.m. — After answering countless emails, I run to an art supply store for poster boards and adhesive to attach the posters ($67.89, expensed). Then I stop at the boba store next door and get a mango milk slush with boba to go. $6.34 4 p.m. — Come home to my boyfriend and his friend watching hockey on the couch, woohoo! We jump in the pool, since the weather is perfect right now, and swim for a few hours. My eldest German Shepherd is obsessed with water, and I am embarrassed to admit that part of why I bought this house is because it has a lap pool just for him. The mom in me is obsessed with watching him swim. 8:30 p.m. — Going to a charcuterie party tonight! Made a quick dinner of buffalo chicken, asparagus, brussels sprouts, and campfire potatoes for dinner while watching the newest episode of during dinner on the couch. Luckily we did a big Costco run yesterday, so I have everything for the charcuterie plate. Make the plate and off we go! With the puppy of course. 11 p.m. — Well that was uneventful. We didn't last long, but it was quite a spread. Come home, wash my face with Cerave, and do a cucumber aloe vera face mask. I get in bed with my boyfriend, our two 100-pound German Shepherds, and . We are obsessed with this show. Time for bed. Daily Total: $6.34",1,1
"10 a.m. — We had a really late night family emergency that kept us all up until 5 a.m. So happy everyone is okay, but we are all exhausted. BF runs out the door late to an appointment and I crawl out of bed. Brush teeth, grab the dogs, and head to the office. It's gonna be a long day... 12 p.m. — So. Tired. Went to my parents to check on everyone, and all is well. I'm starving, but nothing sounds good. Guess that means it's a good day for In-N-Out. Animal style fries fix everything, right? $8.77 3:30 p.m. — The struggle is so real today. Take a break from fixing a broken computer in our office (definitely not how I should be spending my time) and take the dogs outside for a break. Our office used to be a home, so it has a big grassy backyard for them. Yes, they are a little spoiled. Mom is busy today, so I go to pick up my little brother from school for her. Then he and my BF go skating for an hour. My BF is suddenly a major ice skater/hockey player because of the Vegas Golden Knights. Go Knights, go! 5 p.m. — Banana Republic is having a 40% off sale on the whole store; perfect timing for my presentation tomorrow. I get a navy silk top and grey tweed cigarette pants. Then I go home and get directly in the bathtub with a plate of snacks and catch up on . So nice. Make a sandwich for dinner and lay in bed with the BF until I fall asleep around 8. $106.45 Daily Total: $115.22",2,1
"9 a.m. — Today is my presentation. Nerves. I never really dress professionally, but today I gotta step it up. BF makes us breakfast sandwiches of scrambled eggs with peppers, onions, pecorino cheese, and prosciutto. We eat together while talking about his “housewife life,” since he's on a break in his third year of dental school. Lol. 12 p.m. — So. Many. Errands. First to my parents' house to grab a wagon, then to the office to pick up all the supplies for my booth, and then to City Hall. This is going to require caffeine. I get a venti iced chai with two shots from Starbucks, which I order through the app for pick up. $6.75 7 p.m. — Today has flown by. So many people are here! I'm losing my voice after three hours. With 30 minutes left, BF surprises me and shows up with sandwiches. Ugh, I'm so grateful for him. We sit for 30 more minutes eating sandwiches while I finish up. Then we pack up the car and head home! So happy to see the pups!! I make popcorn and lay down. My feet hurt from standing all day, so I soak them in the hottest water I can stand. I'll be glad to be back to my normal routine tomorrow. I'm having a procedure done at my dermatologist's office on my neck tomorrow called Kybella. I am so nervous, because apparently you swell like when Violet Beauregarde turns into a blueberry in , and I have never had Botox or any needles put into my face before. But I'm so excited for the results. Daily Total: $6.75",3,1
"7:30 a.m. — Dogs will not stop whining. I rarely wake up this early, so this is not fun for me. Thankfully the BF gets up and takes them downstairs. I have about another hour to snooze. 10 a.m. — Left the house a little early, so I stop at Coffee Bean for an iced hazelnut coffee. I hate sitting at the doctor's office and waiting forever. $3.87 1:30 p.m. — I survived! It was intense, but not intolerable! My neck is so swollen though. I literally look like a bullfrog. I have to get this done twice more, so I just pay for the whole thing now while I'm here. This shit is not cheap, but it's so worth it. My best friend and her husband are coming home from Portland this weekend to take their engagement photos — talk about bad timing for me, but oh well! I go to work, and have leftover salad for lunch. $1,000 4 p.m. — Everything that was numb is no longer numb and I am in so much pain. Crap. I'm at work and can't even focus. It's gonna be a long weekend with this. I get the dogs and haul ass home to get ready to watch the Knights game tonight. I just recently bought a new car and have been making a constant effort to keep it clean, so I run through the car wash really quickly to keep her shiny. $10.31 7 p.m. — GAME TIME! This bar is so packed. It's the closest thing to being at the game, for sure. It ends up being a total sweep against San Jose of 0-7. The energy is so insane. It's awesome to see Las Vegas finally have an incredible team to rally behind. I Venmo my boyfriend for drinks and beers, and then leave go meet up with a friend. I catch up with her and her fiancé with some classy Coors Light. I'm a sucker for beer. $50 11 p.m. — Meet the boyfriend at home after a long night and pass out. Our team winning made today so fun! But I'm sleepy. Daily Total: $1,064.18",4,1
"8 a.m. — Dogs wake us up again. Oh boy, I am feeling those beers and Bloody Marys. Chug water and get ready for work. I throw on a dress and a light jean jacket, grab the dogs, kiss the BF, and hit the road! 12 p.m. — My best friend's fiancé comes to my work so I can do a video interview of him for her bridal shower coming up. We can't keep straight faces because his answers are so funny. I am so hungry and still hungover. I work with both of my parents, and today I go to lunch with my dad at our spot around the corner. We get Cobb salads and catch up on family drama of the week. I am a major daddy's girl, so I love spending time with him. He buys. Thanks, Dad! 1:30 p.m. — Pick up my best friend from getting her hair done! We have a busy afternoon. I drop  the dogs off at home and then take her to get her makeup done for engagement photos. We stop for boba and sandwiches on the way ($13.87). She is the most easygoing person ever, and I micromanage everything, so this will be simple! We take pictures at some of our favorite bars downtown at sunset. $13.87 7 p.m. — Wow, that was exhausting. We walked at least 30 blocks while I carried outfit changes, but we got amazing photos and I am so stoked for her. We go to Shake Shack after. My best friend and her fiancé have never had it, and I have recently discovered that I like it more than In-N-Out. (This is a very heated topic, I have discovered.) I get a chicken sandwich with extra pickles and they pay as a thank you for my help today. So sweet. After gossiping for hours, I drop them back off at home and crawl into bed with the boyfriend. Today was a long day, and it's good to be in bed by 10. Daily Total: $13.87",5,1
"9 a.m. — Boyfriend and I are of course woken up by the dogs again. We both throw on hats and gym clothes and load the dogs up into the car to grab breakfast. There's a little French place near us that has the most amazing croissants and paninis. We order one of each and grab a spot on the patio. $14.67 3 p.m. — After breakfast, we go home to Netflix and chill. Then I buy groceries through Amazon Pantry: chicken breasts, ground turkey, brussels sprouts, asparagus, arugula, lemons, limes, strawberries, cheese, bell peppers, avocados, pita bread, cauliflower gnocchi, vodka sauce, and tortilla chips. All from my couch. I am so happy. And lazy. $187.98 6 p.m. — I start a sausage and tortellini soup with spinach, onions, and a ton of garlic and lemon zest that hits the spot for a lazy dinner. I crawl into bed with a face mask that my dog decides to pull off and run down the hallway with. What a waste, but so funny. Daily Total: $202.65",6,1
"7 a.m. — I am not a morning person. This is so early for me, but I get up, throw on something a little more professional than normal because I am meeting with investors, and hit the door. My dogs are howling behind the door because they're not coming with me. My heart aches, but I have to go! I hit the Starbucks app for a venti iced chai with two shots and a protein box before I even leave my driveway. $8.75 1 p.m. — We spent the last few hours driving to properties, so we are now starving. I treat my clients to my favorite lunch spot in Vegas called Carson Kitchen in our downtown area. We order a ridiculous amount of tapas to share and the most amazing donut bread pudding, along with a few rounds of whiskey. I can't drink (sadly) because I am the chauffeur, but they happily indulge. This is a company expense, thankfully. ($279.67 expensed) 7 p.m. — What a day! Very productive and exhausting. I walk in the door at home to two happy dogs, a smiling boyfriend who has already made dinner, and the hockey game on. Ugh, I'm not sure what I would do without these guys. It was the perfect ending to this day. Daily Total: $8.75",7,1
"4 a.m. — I wake up after seven full hours of sleep! I feel so amazing — I haven't slept this long in at least six weeks, as my son has been waking up multiple times per night. We've been sleep training him for the past two days using the leave and check method, and it's really paying off. I know people judge parents who sleep train, but in my opinion, it's short-term pain for long-term gain, for the whole family. I feel energized, so I get out of bed and make zucchini bread. My husband's in Shanghai for work, so I don't worry about waking him up. As the bread cooks, I read the , Politico, and Refinery29. I remember I need a UV tent for my son before our next holiday, and find one online. My son wakes up at 6:30 and I give him a breastfeed and a cuddle. $112.36 9:30 a.m. — I'm not working today, so I drive my son to the doctor for his six-month vaccinations ($526.90, but 90% will be reimbursed by insurance). He gets one in each thigh and screams the house down. I hold him as he gets them and I literally can't watch. It's the worst thing, but completely necessary, of course. Afterward, I give him a quick breastfeed in the waiting room to calm him down, and he's back to his usual smiling, giggling self in a few minutes. On the way back to the car, I grab a strawberry rose cooler ($4.57) and pay for parking ($2.13). $533.60 12:30 p.m. — We need more printer cartridges for our ancient printer. They're really hard to find in stores because our printer is such an old model, so I order them online as my son takes a nap. I hate the amount of e-waste in the world, so I'm trying to hold off on buying a new printer for as long as I can. Afterward, I take my son for a walk through the park, and he flirts with some ladies doing tai chi. $57.17 2 p.m. — My helper wants to go grocery shopping to pick up some things for dinner. She's an incredible help and I'm so grateful to have her (we pay her well above Singapore average in recognition of that). She buys mangoes, chickpeas, cheese, spices, herbs, milk, salmon, and coconut water . While she's away, I take my son down to our condo's swimming pool for a play. $47.80 6 p.m. — After I put my son to bed, I eat the dinner my helper made: mango and curried chickpea salad with pan-fried salmon. It's delicious. She eats what we eat (something that's not always the case in Singapore, where helpers are often given a $200/month for food allowance), so she asks if we can have scallops and spiced cauliflower for dinner tomorrow — a recipe she's been wanting to try out. We scour the cupboards to see what spices we already have, and make a grocery list for tomorrow. Afterward, I watch some episodes of season two of . It's such an awesome show, but I'm tired from my 4 a.m. wakeup, so I go to bed at 9. I read on my kindle (so far, it's one of the best books I've ever read) until I fall asleep.

"5 a.m. — It's the weekend! My husband got home from China at around 2 a.m., so he's sleeping soundly as I scroll through Twitter and Instagram in the dark. At 6, I get up and make a frittata for breakfast. It's kind of Persian-inspired and has heaps of herbs, spinach, eggs, feta, goat cheese, garlic powder, salt, pepper, and sumac. I also cut up some fruit to go with it, and make my son's breakfast: oatmeal with frozen black currants, puréed so it's a little less lumpy. He wakes up at 6:45, and I breastfeed him and ""chat"" with him about what we've got planned for the day. My husband wakes up at 8 a.m. and we eat breakfast together, my son smearing most of his oatmeal on his face and chair. I find it completely adorable (well, 90% adorable). 10 a.m. — My husband and I check Singapore's upcoming public holidays and decide to book a four-day getaway to Brunei in August. I have a friend who grew up there and I've always wanted to visit. While our son takes a nap, we find a beautiful child-friendly hotel, and book some flights. While we're living in Singapore, we're trying to take advantage of being so close to so many amazing countries in Asia. We're originally from New Zealand, and flying anywhere from there is a seriously epic journey. It's also a lot cheaper to fly when our kid is under 2! $3,506 1 p.m. — We head to the zoo for the first time with our son. We wanted to wait to go until our son was old enough to enjoy it a bit more. It's great fun — he stares and smiles at all of the animals. We decide to buy a family season pass, especially so I can bring our son on days when I'm not working. I remember that a couple of the women in my mothers' group have them, and send out a group WhatsApp message suggesting we do a trip back here in a few weeks. Since I'm only working part-time, I like filling my days off with fun activities I know my son will enjoy. $167.30 5 p.m. — We give our helper the night off (the scallops and spiced cauliflower can wait until Monday) and order sushi for everyone: oshiniko maki, chukka wake gunkan, edamame, salmon sashimi, maguro sushi, salmon sushi, spicy tuna maki, salmon aburi, and three pieces of salmon teriyaki. The food in Singapore is ridiculously good. We've been living here for four years and I've only ever had one bad meal (that was at a tourist trap, so it doesn't really count). I dry cook a piece of the sashimi for our son and mash it up a little — he seems to enjoy the taste. He's only been on solids for a few weeks, so it's still a bit of trial and error. $68.60 7 p.m. — After our son is asleep, my husband and I chat for a couple of hours about his trip and drink G&Ts. We remember we wanted to watch Ricky Gervais's new Netflix special, and spend an hour parked in front of the TV trying not to nod off. Not that the special isn't good, we're just too tired to fully enjoy it. We go to bed at 10. Daily Total: $3,741.90",2,2
"7 a.m. — It's Sunday and my husband's playing soccer later on, so I make a big breakfast: cappuccinos, carrot cake pancakes, black currant coconut yogurt, and fresh grapefruit, kiwi, and strawberries. My son eats oatmeal with black currants again. Afterward, we take our son to the pool, practicing some of the things his swimming teacher taught him in his last lesson. It's already so hot, the pool is almost like a bath. We still haven't gotten used to the scorching, humid weather here. I don't think we ever will! 10 a.m. — The sandals I ordered last week were delivered yesterday, and they're too small, so I go online and return them (refund of $189.28). There are no bigger sizes in that style, so I find a replacement pair, but also end up buying an additional pair that's on sale as well. $323.99 11:30 a.m. — We go to watch my husband play soccer. His team wins, but it's bittersweet because so many of his teammates are leaving Singapore within the next month. That's the problem with the expat life — so many friends move away when their jobs here finish up, or they get a better offer somewhere else. I've been to more farewell parties than I can count. I wonder how this will affect my son as he grows up here. Will he have expat friends moving away all of the time? My husband reminds me that we too will be moving away, one day. We're definitely not planning on living here forever. It's an amazing country, but there are so many other places in the world we'd love to live in. As we head home (after paying for parking), we fill up the car with gas. $160.05 6 p.m. — I cook dinner while my husband does the bedtime routine — jerk chicken with a kale, cranberry, and tahini salad. I find some vanilla sugar in the cupboard and quickly whip up some almendrados (lemon cookies) for dessert. After we eat, we play a few games of Scrabble, and then review our five-year savings plan Excel sheet. We add our new childcare costs, as well as the school fees that will start late next year when our son starts nursery school. My husband and I both grew up in genuine poverty, and it's extremely comforting for both of us to have clearly defined financial goals, although I don't think I will ever feel financially secure. That's what a childhood marked by neglect does to you, I guess. My husband is paid well, but we're very conscious of living well within our means and building a solid nest egg. We're in bed by 10:30, listening to our son's breathing on the monitor. Daily Total: $484.04",3,2
"6 a.m. — I wake up early to make our usual weekday breakfast smoothie: kale, frozen boysenberries, cacoa nibs, hemp seeds (which I found out yesterday are now illegal to import into Singapore), zero-carb protein powder, and almond milk. My husband starts work super early every day, so he always takes his to go, with a bottle of water. I feed our son and then we all pile into the car. I drop my husband off at work, driving through one toll on the way home. $1.50 7:45 a.m. — The nanny's at home when I get back. We do a quick review of everything she needs to know (what food my son's eating, how much expressed breastmilk to thaw for his milk feeds, his new favorite toy, etc.) before I jump in the shower, get ready for work, kiss my son goodbye, and get back in the car. I get to the office at 9:30 a.m. 1 p.m. — I'm seriously slammed, trying to fit a week's worth of work into the three days I'm in the office. I make a decaf coffee in the office kitchen, eat a lactation bar I brought from home (they help maintain milk production), and then settle in for a long afternoon. I suddenly remember that I need to do a massive online grocery shop, so I quickly organize that after I check with my helper if she wants anything. I buy a wide variety of fruit, heaps of herbs, eggs, spinach, kale, cucumbers, tomatoes, lettuce, shallots, beetroot, capsicum, leeks, fennel, chicken breast, salmon fillets, beef steaks, oxtail, scallops, cheese, almond milk, steel cut oats, macadamias, cashews, fresh coconuts, coconut flour, almond flour, almond butter, cashew butter, beef jerky, seaweed snacks, honey, maple syrup, butter, olive oil, crackers, toilet paper, nappies, cleaning supplies, tissues, and rubber gloves. This should last us about eight days, with additional trips to the shops as needed. $592.35 6 p.m. — I leave work and pick up my husband on the way home, hitting two peak hour tolls. Our son's just finished his bath when we get home, and we take over from the nanny. After our son is in bed, we eat the scallops and spiced cauliflower dinner prepared by our helper. It's amazing, as always. Afterward, my husband has more work to do, and I'm helping a colleague finalize a journal article we've been working on for the past few months. I work on that for most of the evening. I go to bed at 10 p.m. and read until my husband gets into bed at 11. $2 Daily Total: $595.85",4,2
"6 a.m. — Same smoothie and work drop-off routine as yesterday (road toll, again). As I'm leaving to go to work, the nanny says she won't be able to work tomorrow due to an unexpected family health issue. I put a reminder in my phone to organize a replacement for tomorrow ASAP. $1.50 10 a.m. — I have a lull in my day and grab a matcha latte with a coworker. She paid last time, so it's my turn to pay. As much as I love spending time with my kid, I find being at work and around adults seriously enjoyable. My coworker and I chat about some issues she's having with one of our coworkers, and I try to give her some practical advice. On the way back to the office, I buy a Caesar salad with extra chicken to eat at lunch. I'm so hot from all the wandering and can feel sweat prickling my face. Singapore's humidity is murderous! $19.35 6 p.m. — Same office pick-up routine as yesterday. When we get home, we find out that one of our nephews injured himself at school today and has to stay in the hospital overnight for observation, just as a precaution. My brother gives us regular updates, but I feel pretty bad about being so far away and unable to visit him. After our son is asleep, I hop online and buy a few gifts from a toy store near my brother's house, which will be delivered tomorrow. My husband and I also send him a ""get well"" video message over WhatsApp. Singapore is great, but I miss home! $108.25 7 p.m. — After our son is asleep, we eat roasted tomato and quinoa soup for dinner. Afterward, I decide I need to get back into working out regularly, and spend 30 minutes doing a Tracy Anderson DVD. I love workout DVDs and online subscriptions — they're so much more convenient than the gym. The workout hurts, but I enjoy it. Then I take a quick shower and read in bed while my husband keeps working. I fall asleep before he gets into bed. Daily Total: $129.10",5,2
"6 a.m. — Same smoothie and work drop-off routine as yesterday (but we missed the road toll by seconds, this time!). It takes me longer to get out of the house today, as the substitute nanny needs to be more fully briefed about looking after my son. I get to work at 10 and try to avoid running into my boss. (It works — I don't think he noticed I was late.) 12:30 p.m. — I manage to duck out for lunch with my husband. We try to do this once a week, but our normal work schedules are crazy, so it's often impossible. We go to our favorite place overlooking Marina Bay. I have lobster risotto to start and then pork belly, and he has tuna ceviche and then roast chicken. We drink sparkling water. $177.45 3 p.m. — I'm doing an online writing course in my spare time, and one of the instructors recommended a particular book in the last lesson. I find it secondhand online (it's been out of print for decades) and order it with express shipping. $19.50 6 p.m. — My husband has a work function tonight, so I make my way home alone (hitting the road toll). I pay the nanny before she heads home. After I put my son to bed, I eat dinner —  baked beetroot, goat cheese, pine nut, and arugula salad, with sumac lamb meatballs. My helper is seriously the best. I don't know what I'd do without her. After dinner, I take the opportunity to do some writing for my course. I'm in bed by 10 p.m. $120.50 Daily Total: $317.45",6,2
"6 a.m. — It's Thursday so I don't have to work today, but I'm still up early to breastfeed the baby, make breakfast, and take my husband to work (we miss the toll today). When we get home, I feed my son some puréed fruit and then we play. He's so cute! 10 a.m. — After my son wakes up from his nap, we head to a playgroup meet-up at a friend's place. There are 10 other mom friends there with their babies, all around the same age as my son. It's so much fun watching the babies spend time with each other. We chat about mom stuff and politics (Trump, of course, and Comey's new book), and a few of the ladies ask me how it's been going back to work after having the baby — they're about to do the same and want some pointers. I try to focus on the positives, but don't hide the fact that it's a serious juggling act. 2 p.m. — On the way home, I decide to drop into the shops to stock up on some supplies for our short holiday to Borneo next weekend. My son's doctor recommended that we buy pre-made food pouches to feed him, as Hep-B is a risk in Borneo and he can't get vaccinated against that until he's 12 months old. I buy a bunch of different varieties, plus extra kid-safe sunscreen. I grab a honeydew milk tea with tapioca pearls on the way out. I get the low-sugar option, but it's still ridiculously sweet. Worth it. $84.60 6 p.m. — My husband gets home early from work, and we bathe and feed our son together. I'm making dinner tonight, as our helper is feeling unwell. I decide to keep it simple, and make cashew ""hummus"" dip with veggie sticks, plus cheese and crackers. We have fruit for dessert. My husband decides not to work tonight, so we settle down and watch a few episodes of on Netflix. We're in bed by 10 p.m. Daily Total: $84.60",7,2
"7:20 a.m. — My dog alarm clock wakes me up — he's ready to start his day, and makes it known as he jumps on the bed and starts licking my face. We get up and get dressed. As is the case on most days, I don't do a hair and makeup routine besides mascara and a pony tail. We load the dog in the car and drive to the dog park a few blocks away. No one else is there yet this morning (I guess we're early) and our dog is happy that no one else is chasing after his ball. We just returned from a two-week vacation in Myanmar, so we're happy to be reunited with him again and to not have to deal with dog park drama/gossip. 9 a.m. — Back at home, I make coffee in our French press and cook up a breakfast of scrambled eggs with mozzarella and toast with butter. We watch a little  while we eat and then I start my work day. M. and I both work from home, though he's about to begin a new job that will require him to be in a downtown office most days. This will probably be a good change, as it's difficult to balance both being home around each other all the time! We share a home office, but for the most part we try to work in separate parts of the house during the day. I travel to Asia and Canada (I know, not the most logical division of territories) to work with customers nearly 50% of the year, so while that provides some separation, it's still a lot of time together when we're both home. 12:30 p.m. — Another downside to working from home is that I get SO snacky, but I'm good at limiting my munching between meals. I bring my laptop into the kitchen and read blogs while eating re-heated homemade arugula and asparagus pizza with a side of a Trader Joe's salad kit. I feed the puppy and then head to my couch office. Tomorrow I'll kick this habit and go back to my real desk. I get a text from Rover.com that they're offering me a free 30-minute dog walk today. I happily accept the offer and book a walk with a woman who has walked our dog before. I take a break from work to let her in and she heads off with our dog for an afternoon walk. When she returns, she is happy to report they had a great time and that he barked at a stone statue in someone's yard. Ha! I tip $4 through the app. $4 5 p.m. — Work-wise, I'm at a good stopping point for the day, as I've been trying to get my post-vacation inbox down to zero and I've made good progress so far. I shut things down, get changed into running clothes, and load the dog into the car. I'm currently training for a 25K trail race in two months, which is far longer and more difficult than anything I've ever run. I'm totally not a naturally gifted runner, so I'm trying hard to stick to my training plan, though I'm still struggling through the shorter distances. Today I have to do five miles, but after coming off of two weeks of minimal training, I know it's going to be tough. I drive to a trailhead in the foothills and start off with my dog running laps around me along the way. The hilly run is hellish, but I make it 4.6 miles with minimal uphill walking breaks, which is good enough for me! On the way home, I stop to fill up my empty tank. $34.05 6:45 p.m. — Back at home, I meet up with my friend who rents the tiny studio apartment attached to our garage. She's been living there for a few months, and it's been fun having her so close, plus our dogs love to play together. We drive downtown to a brewery together to meet up with another friend for a Kegfit class. I'm new to this scene, but Kegfit is exactly what it sounds like – crossfit with kegs! They partner with a brewery, and for $8, you get a class in the back of the brewery and a free pint of beer after. The class is crazy fun, but I know I'll be sore for days after. The recovery beer helps a bit. $8 8 p.m. — M. and I go out to get tacos at a little Mexican grocery store nearby. I get five mini tacos and a Corona, and M. gets a Tecate and a torta. I pay and tip, and he Venmos me his half. We get home, and I shower and put on my Costco flannel penguin jammies. I read my book ( , about a prison in Bali — not my usual genre of choice, but I found it abandoned on a table in Myanmar and had nothing else to read at the time) and then fall asleep with the puppy at my feet. $10.20 Daily Total: $56.25",1,3
"7:45 a.m. — This morning, M. woke up early to go backcountry skiing with a friend, so I'm on dog duty. We get to the dog park a bit later, so some of the other regulars are there and we catch up while our dogs chase each other around. After my dog is sufficiently worn out, we head home to start the day. I make a gourmet meal of instant oatmeal and add a dollop of plain Greek yogurt and agave sweetener. I eat my breakfast with coffee and the app, wondering what horrifying shenanigans the GOP has been up to overnight. I start my work day at the kitchen table as I eat, but soon move to the office with a second cup of coffee and a Yo-Yo Ma Spotify playlist. 11:30 a.m. — I'm feeling productive today, working through a challenging task of trying to get customers to buy a bunch of inventory that we overproduced. Eventually M. gets home, excited to tell me about his morning in the backcountry. I make us both TJ's frozen turkey burgers with arugula and mozzarella (I only set the smoke detectors off three times in the process) and head back to the office after eating. 3 p.m. — Today is my sister's birthday, and while I remembered to mail her a card, I still haven't gotten her a gift. I browse Amazon and look at Portland restaurant gift cards, but I want to make sure I get her something she'd actually use. I know she has an upcoming trip to Portugal, so I decide to hold off on a gift and offer her some of my Expedia hotel points for her trip instead. 4 p.m. — Finish planning my upcoming work trip that begins next weekend. My travel schedule has been crazy this year, so I'm really glad for these few slow weeks in one place. While traveling on someone else's expense (hello, long-haul business class!) and collecting frequent flyer miles is exciting, being away so much is exhausting. I close my computer and contemplate skipping my run for today since I'm feeling so lethargic, but I compromise with myself and do three grueling miles around the neighborhood instead of my planned five. Not sure how I'm going to do this race but…whatever. 5:30 p.m. — After an afternoon glass of wine on the back porch with my friend while we watch our dogs play, M. and I go around the block for dinner with a couple we met at church. We're both not particularly religious, but I grew up going to church and have known it to be one of the best ways to connect with people in the community. So far, so good! We eat tortellini soup, asparagus, and bread while chatting about our lives, swooning over their new baby girl, and finishing things off with homemade rhubarb pie. After a few rounds of the board game ""Codenames,"" we leave them to put their baby to bed and meet up with our friend and her dog to go to one of the many Boise bars that allow dogs. We talk about our dreams of investing in tiny homes and a mutual friend's upcoming baby shower. We get Stone IPAs, which I put on my tab because I'm feeling extra generous. Home and in bed by 10:30. $31.55 Daily Total: $31.55",2,3
"8 a.m. — Feeling super out of it this Friday morning. I guess I haven't been drinking much lately, so it's really hitting me! M. lets me sleep a bit longer while he does solo dog park duty and I eventually get my bum out of bed, make coffee, and collect the trash, recycling, and compost for pickup. When M. and the dog get back, I make us eggs fried in coconut oil and toast with peanut butter. Not the best combination, but it works! I'm always extremely hungry from the moment I wake up, so breakfast is non-negotiable for me. 11 a.m. — After a few hours of work, we realize that it's the first Friday of the month, which means our local co-op has deals, deals, deals! We always shop there on sale days or whenever we want to stock up on locally-sourced meat. Today we buy a dog toy for our angel child (dog toys are sooo expensive, and he destroys everything, so we spend about 10 minutes trying to decide which toy to invest in), two bottles of wine, local steelhead trout, two NY strip steaks, eggs, romaine lettuce, quick oats, Bubbies pickles (the BEST), Siggi's yogurt, and two cans of Blue Sky soda. We use our monthly 10% member discount and split the total. $39.52 12:30 p.m. — Speaking of expensive pet stuff, our dog needs a new collar, since he's grown out of his current one. We take a measurement and I order one off Wilderdog's site. M. Venmos me half. I stick two more turkey burgers in the oven and try to avoid repeating yesterday's smoke detector mishap. We load the burgers with mozzarella, pickles, and mustard, and wrap them in lettuce. Halfway through lunch, M. informs me that I have mustard on my face, per usual. I'm a messy eater, what can I say? $15.50 4:30 p.m. — I finish some compliance trainings for work and am too much in Friday mode to start another big project I have this month. I promise myself I'll begin on Monday, and log off for the day. M. gets back from a run and I change into shorts and a t-shirt so we can get to work weeding the front yard. We take a quick water and peanut butter Clif Bar break somewhere in between pulling weeds and cleaning debris. The neighbors from next door stop by and invite us to take a tour of the new house they're building in the lot next to ours. It's modern, beautifully built, and absolutely huge — it feels like it's towering over our house! They were really lucky to snag this property (as were we with our house!) because Californians keep “discovering” the cheap cost of living in Boise, buying property, and driving our costs up! (Sorry, CA – I love you, but you can go home after you visit!) 6:45 p.m. — M. moves to the backyard where he weed whacks and mows, and I help by picking up all the dog poo that has accumulated. When I'm finished, I wash up and start making mashed potatoes to go with dinner. I season asparagus with TJ's garlic salt and olive oil, salt and pepper the strip steaks, and toss together a simple green salad with romaine, arugula, and TJ's champagne pear dressing. M. tosses the asparagus and steak on the grill when he finishes with the yard, and then we sit down for a wonderful summer-y meal, all washed down with a small pour of chilled Sauvignon Blanc. 8 p.m. — Kiss the pup goodbye and head off for a hot Friday night date at the gym. Unsurprisingly, we have almost the whole place to ourselves! I do leg and arm machines and end the session with a few partner ab exercises. We consider stopping by a nearby bar to say hi to a friend who picked up a shift there tonight, but instead go to Albertsons, where M. gets a six-pack of PBR and I get birthday cake Halo Top. We end the night tossing the ball to our dog in the backyard while I read several articles on my phone about the illusion behind Halo Top being considered “healthy.” $4.99 Daily Total: $60.01",3,3
"7:30 a.m. — Dog needs to pee. I open the door to the backyard, let him out, and then lure him back to bed with a toy. We eventually both pass out. 10:30 a.m. — WOW. I can't remember the last time we all slept in like this — I guess we needed it. It's a rainy morning, so we skip the dog park and play for a bit inside instead. I make whole wheat pancakes and M. makes coffee, and we eat the pancakes smothered in peanut butter, vanilla Siggi's, and syrup. Then we get the dog ready to go to a nearby greenhouse, where we load up on garden essentials. It's packed today, since everyone is starting planting season. We get a variety of lettuces, kale, arugula, chard, brussels sprouts, broccoli, chives, and oregano. I also get 15 cubic feet of organic raised bed soil. We had a gift card to this greenhouse, but we can't locate it, so we have no choice but to pay ourselves. I pay, since it will be primarily my project. $97.98 12:30 p.m. — I spend a few hours putting together our new raised plant bed to go along with our existing one (the directions are SO complicated, and it takes me much longer than expected) while M. cleans the grill. I divide the soil between the two beds, adding organic fertilizer that I have leftover from last year. I see a big storm cloud overhead, so I quickly do the planting. Soon it's pouring and I'm hungry, so I heat up leftover steak and mashed potatoes, and mix together a salad. M. and I had an argument during the gardening process and I'm still a little salty, so I eat alone at the table and then head to the bedroom to read for a while. After a few minutes, I start dozing, and then wake up to sunny skies. I grab gardening tools and a few packages of seeds and take the dog to the front yard to plant a variety of edible flowers, poppies, and Black-eyed Susans. When I get back inside, M. is ready to talk about our argument. We make up and then cuddle with the puppy on the couch for a bit. 4 p.m. — Both M. and I have scheduled runs today, and luckily the rain hasn't been as aggressive as the forecast promised. I get into running clothes and make my way to the Greenbelt (a bike/pedestrian path that winds along the river) for my six-mile run. It's a bit painful, but I get through it with help from Anna Faris's podcast! When I get back, I play with the dog for a while until M. returns and we discuss dinner. We're both too exhausted (he ran almost 12 miles) to cook, so we pre-order a pizza from a place downtown and invite our friend/tenant to join us. When we get there, she buys beers and we pay for the pizza. It's so greasy and perfect. $16 9 p.m. — Our friend informs us that it's National Beer Day, so we figure it's a good excuse to check out a new bicycle-themed taproom downtown. We quickly stop home to pick up our dogs and then make our way to the bar where we each buy our own beers. I drink a Hefeweizen while we socialize our dogs. Then we go back home and our friend comes to our house with her dog and a six-pack. The three of us end the evening playing that game called Heads Up! that Ellen Degeneres plays on her show. It's so funny, especially when you're delirious after a long day. $5.50 Daily Total: $119.48",4,3
"9:30 a.m. — I think M. got up at one point to let the dog out last night, but we're all three still in bed at 9:30 and I can't believe it, again. Good thing we got so much sleep this weekend, because I leave for another work trip next week and will be glad to be so rested. We all lazily get up, M. and I get dressed, and we drive to the dog park. It's more crowded today than I've ever seen it — there are probably more than 50 dogs there, all chasing each other, pooping, and running after toys. Our dog is pretty focused on his ball, so we toss it to him, chat with a few other dog owners, and leave by 10, which is when the off-leash time ends. 10:15 a.m. — Breakfast today is a mixture of vanilla Siggi's, plain TJ's Greek yogurt, peanut butter toast, and coffee. After we eat, we fill up the bathtub for the pup's bath time. He hates it, but is cooperative anyway. While he runs around trying to get dry, we clean the bathroom and get ready to head out to go shopping. 11:30 a.m. — We drive to the Pendleton outlet to see what kind of bath towels they have in stock. M. recently visited his sister's house and raved about the Pendleton towels they have, but they're too expensive online. The outlet only has one style in stock and they're still $40, so we decide to pass. We stop by the Eddie Bauer outlet where we each buy something from their 50% off sale — M. gets a running shirt and I snag a windbreaker. $26.50 12:30 p.m. — Our fridge is looking a bit sparse, so we go to WinCo to pick up a few groceries. I prefer Trader Joe's, but WinCo has an amazing bulk section, so it's our store of choice today. We get milk, eggs, carrots, bananas, apples, clementines, cilantro, an onion, potatoes, brussels sprouts, coffee beans, bulk curry powder and turmeric, cheese sticks, turkey lunch meat, Tillamook yogurts, salsa, and protein bars. On the way out, we each get a Shasta soda from the vending machine. M. pays, and I Venmo him for half. $26.35 3:30 p.m. — Lunch was apple slices and cheddar with a piece of toast and TJ's Everything But The Bagel seasoning. After eating, I clean my car (I love my dog, but I can't stand dog hair) before falling asleep on the couch with M. — I blame too much sleep…it always makes me more tired! I read my book for a bit, and then we take the dog for a walk around the neighborhood. A.k.a. my time to snoop on other people's gardens. 5 p.m. — I get dressed for my final run of the week. I'm scheduled to do another six miles, but I settle on five with a decent incline. I try a new gradual uphill trail and I feel it big time in my quads! I thought the way down would be a breeze, but I get a stomach cramp, and it's not as easy as I thought it would be. The beautiful view of Boise at dusk distracts me a bit. After the five miles, I've done 21.6 of the 25 miles I was planning to do this week, which I consider sufficient. 7 p.m. — M. has dinner just about ready, but there's something wrong with the grill, so I help him transfer things to the oven. We have roasted brussels sprouts, grilled and baked steelhead trout, and leftover mashed potatoes, washed down with cheap Trader Joe's red wine. It's really hitting the spot. We watch a climbing group's documentary about their trip to Myanmar and then I watch before passing out at 11. Daily Total: $52.85",5,3
"7:30 a.m. — Solo parenting the dog again this morning, since M. has an early meeting downtown. At the dog park, there are four other dogs chasing the ball I throw and my poor babe hardly gets a turn at the action. Back at home, I make instant oats with peanut butter and agave, grab coffee that M. made, and head to the office. I got paid today, so I pay a few bills and pay an extra $100 towards my credit card bill, bringing it down to zero. Now all my debt is consolidated in my line of credit, which has been surprisingly great for my credit score. 11:30 a.m. — Work is slower than usual today, which is good, because I'm about to log off for a few hours. About once or twice a month (if I'm not on a work trip), I volunteer at the women's prison in their education department. I did similar volunteer work during college, so I was excited to find a way to continue it here in Idaho. On my 30-minute drive to the prison I eat a cheese stick, apple, and a Clif Bar and listen to the podcast This episode really hits home, as she talks about how hard it is to do things you're not good at and work your ass off anyway. This is something I'm working on! 2 p.m. — I help with two classes at the prison today, both in re-entry. Today we work on résumé writing and how to disclose your criminal history to an employer, and take a touch typing test. The women in both class sections are wonderful and bounce great ideas off of each other. 3 p.m. — I log back onto my computer once I get home and respond to a few emails I missed while away. After I've reviewed most items, I heat up more chicken chili and eat at my desk, simultaneously engaging with my dog via pull toy. Eventually I wrap up work and change for the hill repeats on my training schedule. I ask M. to come along and we take the dog to the foothills, choose a manageable-looking hill, and then M. keeps time as I do a variety of distances and paces. I'm pooped at the end. 6:30 p.m. — I have an hour to kill before another Kegfit class, so I eat a banana cinnamon Siggi's and make dinner. I cut up chicken breast and potatoes and throw them into the Instant Pot along with curry, turmeric, cayenne, and a variety of other spices. Instant Pots are magic and the curry is ready in less than 10 minutes. M. eats while I get ready to go. 9 p.m. — Kegfit was, once again, so amazing. It was a lot of leg work, which was brutal after my hills, but I have a great time socializing with the other members over a beer at the end. I decide to buy six classes for a $36 deal, which seems like a crazy bargain to me! Back at home, I heat up curry and TJ's garlic naan, eat on the couch while watching with Bill Hader, and eventually fall asleep. $36 Daily Total: $36",6,3
"7:15 a.m. — Wake up to a work crisis, which is the worst way to start the day! I do a little damage control and then toss on leggings and boots and head to the dog park. When we get back, I make scrambled eggs with cheese, toast, and pourover coffee, and M. helps me water all of the plants I put in this weekend. I start my workday at the kitchen table, but later move to the office where I have fewer distractions. I consider working at my coworking space downtown, but there's nice lighting in the office right now and I'm not loving the idea of changing out of my leggings. M. eventually joins me at his desk and I turn on a classical Spotify playlist. I come up for air/ bathroom breaks a few times, but otherwise am totally in the zone for the morning. I take a break to eat an apple, too. 12:45 p.m. — Lunchtime! M. takes the dog for a run and I heat up frozen white bean chicken chili that my mom made during her recent visit. I top it with plain yogurt, cilantro, and cheese. 2:30 p.m. — I really need a break. It's a gorgeous day, so I convince M. to take a walk with me and we somehow (I totally planned it) end up at a gas station where I buy him a fountain soda and one of those gas station slushies for me. I always want the biggest size and end up drinking a quarter of it before feeling sick. $3.80 5 p.m. — Work was absolutely draining today. I do a core workout that M. calls “Killer Core” and then FaceTime with my cousin where we talk about how directionless we feel in our careers. At least I'm not alone! I make a pizza with a Trader Joe's whole wheat crust and top it with loads of arugula. M. and I devour the entire thing. For the rest of the night, I bum around on the couch waiting for Netflix to load, take the dog for a walk, and then somehow it's 10:30 and I'm ready for bed! Daily Total: $3.80",7,3
"9:20 a.m. — Wake up after snoozing the alarm a few times. It's a rough wake-up this morning —I think from a combination of my sleep apnea being particularly bad lately and the fact that I had three too many glasses of champagne at a 70th birthday party last night. I get dressed, feed my cat, and scoop the litter box. 11:30 a.m. — Roll through the Starbucks drive-through for an iced blonde latte with my boyfriend, M. I often put both our drinks on my Starbucks card so I can earn more stars. Sometimes I ask him to Venmo me back and sometimes I don't. Today I don't. $7.90 12 p.m. — Arrive at work and settle into my desk. I don't have any appointments today, so I just get straight to work on styling some clients' monthly looks. Having trouble keeping my eyes open, even though I'm drinking my coffee. 3 p.m. — Decide to take lunch an hour early because I didn't eat breakfast and I'm starving. I walk to a local burger joint, Tom's #5, and get a cheeseburger, fries, and a Coke. I eat lunch with my favorite coworkers and read about the Golden State Killer, followed by a supremely chilling article written by the BTK Killer's daughter. I'm a true crime fanatic through and through, and a few of my coworkers are fellow Murderinos, so we often trade stories and share articles with each other. $6.50 5:20 p.m. — Walk with my friend and coworker to move our cars into the office lot. We're not allowed to park here during the day because the other tenants in our building own the spots, but we can move our cars in after 5 p.m. I like to do this on days when I work until 8 or 9 p.m. so that I have a shorter distance to walk in the dark when I leave. 9:30 p.m. — Arrive home from work and find a great parking spot on the street. We only have one parking spot in the garage of our building, and my boyfriend and I trade off week to week. I had a late lunch so I'm not super hungry, but we just got our weekly box of Imperfect Produce, so I make a little something. We started our Imperfect Produce subscription a few weeks ago and we're obsessed — it costs about $11-15 per week for a box of veggies that holds us over for the week ahead, and we're helping reduce food waste at the same time. There's nothing wrong with the veggies — they're either funky-shaped or produced in surplus — and they would otherwise be discarded if we didn't buy them because they were deemed ""not good enough"" for the grocery store! Tonight, I roast acorn squash, zucchini, onion, and brussels sprouts in olive oil, salt, pepper, red pepper flakes, and turmeric. 10:30 p.m. — Watch YouTube videos before pouring a big glass of ice water and doing my evening skincare routine. I wash my face with a Japanese foam cleanser called Naive, tone with rosewater, apply Le Labo moisturizer, and brush my teeth. Then I get settled on the couch and crack into the book I'm currently reading, . It's a gorgeously written autobiography by Clemantine Wamariya, a survivor of the Rwandan genocide. I'm just a few dozen pages in, but I'm totally captivated by her story and her writing. I read until it's time for bed. Daily Total: $14.40",1,4
"9:30 a.m. — Wake up after hitting snooze a few times. I have the day off work, so I relish the extra time in bed with M. We relax and fool around for a while, finally forcing ourselves up around 11:30 to get dressed and head to the bank. It's the first of the month, so rent is due today. Our building requires us to pay rent with a cashier's check, so we head over and pick one up, and then head to the Starbucks drive-through for coffee. M. pays. 12 p.m. — Arrive back at home, and after dropping off the check, we make lunch. There are still veggies leftover from last night, which we eat with rice, prepackaged Indian food (madras lentils for me, Kashmir spinach for him), and fresh cucumber and avocado. We watch the latest episode of and I clip my cat's claws, which she hates. 2 p.m. — I scrounge up enough quarters from our coin bank to do my laundry. I was getting dangerously low on underwear, so doing this chore is a necessity. $5.25 3:25 p.m. — I grab my laundry from the machines and fold it while watching YouTube videos. I have a huge appreciation for luxury fashion, but lack the budget to purchase much of it at this point in my life, so it's fun to live vicariously through vlogger ladies. I also pour myself a big glass of ice water. I drink lots and lots of water at work every day, so I try to keep that up when I'm at home, too. Hydration is so important! 5:44 p.m. — I've been feeling pretty bleh all day, and I think it's because I'm PMS-ing. I'm craving junk food and also feeling super lazy, so I decide to order Jack in the Box on Postmates. I order my favorite, a Jack's Spicy Chicken meal, and add a Jumbo Jack to avoid the small cart fee. M. is at work and will be there until midnight, so I'll veg out and watch TV tonight on my own. While I'm waiting for Postmates, I take a quick shower. I use Kristin Ess Extra Gentle Shampoo and L'Oreal conditioner. $21.72 8 p.m. — I pack a bowl of Blue Dream weed and settle in on the couch with . I've cut back significantly on the amount of weed I smoke when I'm alone, but tonight I just want to chill and loaf around, so I smoke a little bowl by myself. 10:07 p.m. — Update: I'm high and can't stop watching Cardi B interviews. I love her so much. 12:30 a.m. — Go to bed after finishing up the episode of hosted by Chadwick Boseman with Cardi B as the musical guest. I have a bit of trouble falling asleep (I think it's because my doctor recently increased my Zoloft dosage and my body is still adjusting to it), but it ends up being a productive time — M. and I talk through issues I've been having at work lately, and I come up with exciting ideas that I look forward to implementing tomorrow. I finally fall asleep around 1:25 a.m. Daily Total: $26.97",2,4
"7:30 a.m. — I wake up before my alarm and can't get back to sleep. After some Instagram-scrolling, I crack into and read for about an hour. The story is so captivating that I've almost finished the whole thing, and this is only my third day of reading it. 9 a.m. — My alarm goes off and M. wakes up, too. I get out of bed after we have time together and then do my morning routine: wash my face with Naive face wash, tone with rosewater, apply Le Labo moisturizer, and then put on Dr. Jart Cicapair Tiger Grass Color Correcting Treatment, Bare Minerals powder, Tarte blush, and Bobbi Brown mascara. Lately I've been keeping my makeup minimal during the day and then adding a flick of cat-eye liner and lipstick for nights out. 11:15 a.m. — I hop in my car, which has been on E for a day, and can feel it sputtering out as I pull into the gas station. After gassing up ($30.11), I stop at the Starbucks drive-through ($3.95) and then head to the office. $34.06 12 p.m. — Arrive at work and settle into my desk. I'm excited to implement some of the new ideas I brainstormed while I was tossing and turning last night, and I get right to it while writing to my clients. In just a couple of hours, I can tell that it's having an impact, which is super exciting. I'd been feeling a bit uninspired and unmotivated with certain aspects of my job, and now I'm starting to get back into the groove. 1:30 p.m. — When I work the 12 to 9 p.m. shift, my eating schedule gets all out of whack. I'm hungry, so I grab my leftover rice and lentils from yesterday's lunch to eat. 4 p.m. — Just as I start to get really stir crazy, it's time for my lunch break. I walk with a few of my coworkers to the trendy shopping area down the street from our office, and they pick up boba from a new tea spot. Then we make a stop at an awesome Mexican place, where I order chips and guac. It's fantastic. I move my car into the office lot. $5.45 9:25 p.m. — Arrive home and immediately change into silk boxers and take off my bra. That's gotta be one of the best feelings in the world. I spaced out my meals a lot better today, so I'm not hungry for a late night dinner. For lunch tomorrow, I roast up brussels sprouts with olive oil, salt, pepper, garlic powder, red pepper flakes, and brown sugar, and make Israeli couscous with bell pepper, cucumbers, and avocado. 10:50 p.m. — I chat on the phone with M. for a while — he's leaving work and headed to a friend's house to hang and play video games — and then decide I want to finish off tonight. I turn on the heater and light a candle to up the cozy factor and then hop to it. 11:47 p.m. — I'm suddenly exhausted, so I tuck in and decide to finish reading tomorrow. Daily Total: $39.51",3,4
"8:40 a.m. — Wake up and roll around in bed for a while, not wanting to get up. After a while, I force myself out of bed and hop in the shower. My hair has a lot of product in it today, so I double-shampoo and then shave my legs and armpits while conditioning. 10:20 a.m. — I leave the house a little later than planned, but still feel the need to get coffee on the way to work. As usual, I roll through the Starbucks drive-through that's on my way and pick up an iced latte. I text my boss to let her know I'll be a few minutes late. $3.95 11:08 a.m. — I sit down at my desk and discover a beautiful bouquet of chamomile flowers and gerbera daisies on it. My friend/coworker has been buying herself flowers every week, and gifting flowers to someone else, too — and today, I'm the lucky recipient. It gets my day off to a really great start. 12:10 p.m. — A few of my coworkers and I devised a plan earlier in the week to drink pre-workout supplements at the beginning of the workday today and then power through the day. I've never tried pre-workout before, and it smells and tastes exactly like a melted popsicle. I'm into it. 2 p.m. — I've had a latte and pre-workout and I'm starting to feel pretty jazzed, but it's not much more than a little caffeine buzz. It's lunchtime, so I grab the Israeli couscous and veggies I made last night. A couple of my coworkers and I decide to drink a little more pre-workout, too. 3 p.m. — It's time for our team meeting, and we talk a bit about business-to-business partnerships. We also all take time to pen handwritten notes to some of our clients to show appreciation. By the end of the meeting, that second dose of pre-workout is starting to kick in and I'm feeling good — I get cracking on my to-do list and it's moving right along. I feel a little crazy, but in a good way. 5:30 p.m. — Our employee committee has put together a happy hour in the office today, so my coworkers and I walk over and jump into the party. The DJ is another one of our coworkers, and there are margaritas, beers, and an amazing taco bar catered by another coworker's mom. My office knows how to party, and we dance our asses off to all kinds of music, but mostly Cardi B. 6:30 p.m. — Happy hour is over, but I'm still on the clock until 8. I finish up the last of the items on my to-do list while sweating profusely. We danced really hard, and the pre-workout really enhanced the experience — I ended up getting a real workout in! 8:45 p.m. — There's a ton of traffic getting home due to a broken-down car on my route, but I make it back and immediately open up . I've been looking forward to finishing it all day, and the culmination of the story, and Clemantine's reflections in the wake of such tragedy, make me cry. 10:40 p.m. — I'm tired, so I turn on on Netflix and cozy up on the couch, where I plan to stay until I'm ready to tuck in.

"7:30 a.m. — My alarm is particularly heinous this morning — it's always rough waking up for a 9 a.m. shift after late mornings all week. I snooze a couple of times and then roll myself out of bed. Traffic is much worse getting to work at this hour, so I don't have much time to waste. I wash my face, put on makeup, do my hair in milkmaid braids, and hit the road. 9 a.m. — I don't have time to stop for coffee, but I get to the office at 9 a.m. on the dot. It's Friday, so there's a lighter mood in the office and lots of people have chosen to work from home. I have a styling appointment with a client today, so I take care of a couple things before grabbing a rack and pulling clothing and shoe options for her. 11:30 a.m. — My client arrives and we get started with her appointment. She's looking for a few things for her upcoming trip to New York, so I put together a bunch of different chic and modern looks. It's my first time working with this client, and she's wonderful. We have a great time and she leaves happy. 1:30 p.m. — After the appointment wraps up, I get back to my desk and tackle a couple more things on my to-do list before lunch. I didn't pack any lunch from home today, so I walk to the co-op down the street to get machaca tacos. I sample some pico de gallo bean and rice chips and they're delicious, so I get a bag of them, too. $7 4:30 p.m. — I was asked to speak to a group of new hires during their team meeting, so I talk a little bit about what I do, plus strategies for best serving and understanding clients, and then answer some questions. These new hires are really excited and engaged, and I'm looking forward to seeing them grow within the company. 6 p.m. — I wrap up at work and pack my computer to bring home with me. I'm off tomorrow, but working from home on Sunday and Monday, so I'll need my computer with me. M. is at work for a while longer, so I go home to chill for a bit. On my way, I pick up a chicken sandwich from Burger King. $4.09 7 p.m. — I get home and watch the John Mulaney episode of while eating. M. calls as he's leaving the studio — our friend is having people over at his place tonight and we're invited. Since I don't have to work tomorrow, I'm game for drinks. M. gets home and makes himself dinner before we head to our friend's place together. 9:30 p.m. — It's more of a party than expected. I take a couple shots and drink a few beers while catching up with friends. We get into a conversation about self-defense and my friend teaches us some Krav Maga moves. 11:30 p.m. — We decide to take the party to a bar, so my friend calls a Lyft and we go to a speakeasy nearby. We stand in line for a few minutes before deciding it's not worth the wait, and  then my friend calls another Lyft to head to a dive bar down the street. It's one of our regular places, and it's more our speed anyway. 11:50 p.m. — M. gets me a tequila and grapefruit juice — my favorite. There's karaoke at the bar, and we get into it, singing along and dancing. I get the second round of drinks for M. and me and tip $2. $14.10 1:40 a.m. — Our friends have slowly filtered out, and M. and I are the last ones standing at the bar. We decide it's time to pack it in and head home. M. suggests stopping at the Taco Bell drive-through on the way home, and it's impossible to say no. I feel bad because I've had so much fast food this week, but there's nothing like TB to cap off a long night of drinking. I order a Chalupa and Nachos Supreme. M. pays. 2:15 a.m. — We get home and chow down while watching fail videos on YouTube, and then we pass the fuck out. Daily Total: $25.19",5,4
"7:30 a.m. — Hooooly moly. I'm up because I can never sleep in after a long night of drinking. I have a headache. Can't fall back asleep, so I mindlessly scroll through my phone for a while. 8:30 a.m. — M. wakes up and we chat for a bit, and then he gets up to get the day started. He has rehearsal today for his show later tonight, and he needs to get moving. I lay around in bed for a while longer and end up falling back asleep. 11 a.m. — I wake up for real and force myself out of bed. I drink a big glass of water, take Advil, and give M. a see-you-later kiss before he leaves. Then I get into the shower and listen to an episode of T  podcast while I shampoo, condition, and shave. 1:30 p.m. — I need a little pick-me-up, so I drive to Starbucks. I have a reward on my account, so I order a venti iced blonde latte with an extra shot and a sausage and egg sandwich ($3.75). On the way back home, I stop to get get gas and a car wash ($51.43). I try to keep the exterior of my car fairly clean at all times (let's not discuss the interior), and I enjoy the ritual of going through the drive-through car wash. $55.18 3 p.m. — After eating my lunch and watching TV, I remember that I'm almost out of moisturizer. I recently took to Instagram to crowdsource ideas for a great moisturizer for oily skin, and a friend of mine recommended hyaluronic acid. I pick up her recommended brand from Amazon: Asterwood Naturals. Then I take a nap. I'm going to M.'s show later tonight and I want to have enough energy. $16.90 5:30 p.m. — Finally force myself to get up after snoozing my nap alarm a million times. I wash my face and get dressed for the concert. I decide to get a little more made up than usual, so I use pretty green eyeshadow in addition to my regular face of makeup, and then hop in my car and head to Hollywood. 7:05 p.m. — I almost never spend time in this part of town, and everyone and their mother is out and about today. I refuse to pay $15 to park in a lot, so I spend 20 minutes driving around looking for a meter spot on the street. I find one about four blocks away from the venue. $4 7:25 p.m. — I meet up with M. and a couple of our friends at a restaurant next door to the concert venue. I'm hungry, so I get a slice of pizza to hold me over until we all go out for a larger dinner later. I also order a tequila and pineapple juice (they're out of grapefruit) at the bar, and the bartender charges me the shot special price, which is nice. $12.96 8 p.m. — We make our way to the venue and M. pays the cover charge for me. We see four bands play and they're all great — but sadly, the band that plays before M.'s goes over their allotted set time, so the venue cut M.'s band's performance short. It's a bummer, but they roll with the punches. We're exhausted and hungry by the time the show is over, so we decide to bounce right away and get a late dinner before heading home. 11:15 p.m. — We all decided earlier in the night that we wanted to chow down on wings after the show, so we're sad when we discover that Big Wangs has permanently closed! After Yelping, we find Hot Wings Cafe, and we're all excited to get out of the shitshow that is downtown Hollywood. I order a 12-piece basket of wings, half hot and half lemon pepper. I know I can't eat it all, but I plan to save half for lunch tomorrow. $20.03 12:30 p.m. — M. and I get home, smoke a bowl, and spend a long time talking before getting too tired to function and falling asleep.

"8 a.m. — I wake up before my alarm, anticipating that it's going to ring soon. I'm working from home today, so I take my time getting up and getting ready. I scroll through Instagram and then play Design Home on my phone. I buy “diamonds” that I need for the game. I also send a text to check in on a friend who's going through a rough time because her grandmother recently passed away. $4.99 9 a.m. — I clock in on my laptop and get started answering some emails. M. has a baseball game this morning, so he wakes up shortly after me and starts getting ready. I had to park pretty far last night because we got home so late, so when he's ready, I have him drop me at my car so I can move it closer. I pick up a coffee at Starbucks before going back home. $3.95 12:15 p.m. — I'm starting to get hungry, so I reheat my leftover wings, which I eat while styling options for clients. 12:45 p.m. — My little brother calls me for advice. His landlord is raising his rent on him, so he's looking for a new place. We talk awhile about the apartment he looked at today and its pros and cons, and also just catch up a little bit on life. We make plans to get together next weekend. 3 p.m. — I start to get a little hungry, so I eat the Trader Joe's salad that we have in the fridge. Curried chicken salad is one of my very favorite foods. 4:20 p.m. — I've finished up with all of today's clients, so I start on a dangerous mission: browsing The RealReal. When I do buy designer, I pretty much only stick to consignment items. I'm a big fashion archive person, so it's really fun discovering pieces that I remember seeing on the runway five, 10, or even 15 years ago — now for much more affordable prices. I also hunt for gifts for my friend's upcoming baby shower. I'm thinking of getting her some beautiful indigo-dyed bibs and a cool teething necklace. 5:15 p.m. — I'm hit with a wave of sleepiness, so I take a 30-minute nap. 6 p.m. — I clock out and put away my work computer. I'm already thinking about dinner and I know I have a free delivery code on Postmates, so I scroll through my options and decide on Fatburger. It's delivered in about 20 minutes, and I eat while starting . I can't believe it's taken me so long to watch this, because I'm immediately hooked. The way each side of the story is presented is completely gripping. I plan on having a night in and just relaxing. $17.14 Daily Total: $26.08",7,4
"7 a.m. — After ignoring my alarm for the last hour, I finally crawl out of bed. I usually like Monday mornings; I like waking up at 6 a.m., working out in my apartment, having a nice breakfast, and starting the week off right. But after being sick for an entire month, this is one of those Mondays. I barely make it out of bed to wash my face (I'm into Korean skincare) and heat up oats, which I mix with peanut butter and chia seeds. I also have a much needed cup of coffee with almond milk to try to turn myself into a person who can entertain tiny humans all day. I take a multivitamin, a turmeric capsule, and a fiber supplement. They're a bit costly but my body needs the extra help right now. 8:30 a.m. — I arrive at work (a 12-minute walk from my apartment) and again try to shake myself into being prepared for the day. I really like my job most of the time, but as an introvert, teaching wipes me out and being sick is not helping. (It's not a normal type of cold, either, but this strange dizziness I've been feeling constantly.) Thankfully, I only have three classes on Mondays and they're all third grade, which is honestly the easiest grade I teach. I can do this. 12:10 p.m. — Lunchtime, finally. Korean school lunches are fantastic. Today's is multigrain rice, kimchi, shredded potatoes, seaweed soybean soup, and breaded chicken with green onions. The cost of lunch is roughly $2.70 a meal, and it's taken out of my paycheck each month. I take another fiber supplement with lunch. 2 p.m. — Thanks to the aforementioned dizziness, I leave work early today to talk with my doctor. He tells me the blood work I had done last week came back clean. Then he does an ultrasound on my back, since I have some bumps that I want to get checked out, and takes a couple of X-rays. Neither provides any insight into what's going on with my body. Over an hour later, I leave frustrated and with essentially no answers. He does prescribe medication that he thinks will help, though, plus antibiotics for a small infection in my throat and probiotics for my constipation. Picking up prescribed medicine is always easy in Korea because in every commercial building there's at least one clinic and one pharmacy. Usually, you get prescribed enough medicine for three days worth of treatment, which then gets divided and packaged into breakfast, lunch, and dinner sections. $28.76 3:45 p.m. — On my way home, I pick up a couple of things at the store: bananas (I like them in my morning oats) and crackers for a taste-testing activity I'm doing at work tomorrow. $4.67 6 p.m. — I like the idea of cooking but I haven't matured enough to the point of taking the time and money to do it well, so my meals are always simple. Dinner tonight is my go-to stir fry: tofu in sesame oil and soy sauce, bean sprouts, bell pepper, spinach, and multigrain rice. I also take my fiber supplement again, plus the cocktail of drugs the doctor prescribed, and chocolate afterward. 8 p.m. — I usually go to sleep around 10 p.m. but I'm so exhausted I go to bed much earlier. At night, my Korean skincare routine really comes out — cleanser, toner, essence, vitamin C serum, eye cream, and moisturizer. It sounds excessive but I can honestly see how much brighter and happier my skin is because of it. After my routine, I write in my diary and go to bed with Trevor Noah's . Daily Total: $33.43",1,5
"6:40 a.m. — I get up early today to shower before work. (Showering is something I'm willing to put off for a day, but not two.) After my shower, I put on toner, face moisturizer, argan oil hair essence, and then heat up my usual oats. I drink coffee and take my multivitamin, turmeric, fiber, and medicine from the doctor. It's a lot of pills. I feel like I'm 87. 8:30 a.m. — I'm back at work, not feeling like the medicine has done much of anything, but that's life. The doctor's pretty sure I have a type of vertigo that I'm just going to have to wait out. My fifth graders have been learning words to describe the taste, and today we're going to be taste testing various foods. It's going to be a long day, so I've got to pull it together. 12:10 p.m. — I truly love lunch time. Today is kimchi soup with tofu, multigrain rice, radish kimchi, a green root vegetable I still can't identify, and a small cheese omelet. It's enough to keep me going through my last class at 1 p.m. I also take my fiber supplements and medicine again. 2 p.m. — After finishing my last class, I'm at my desk with a free cup of coffee from my office. We used to have a lot of snacks at work that we'd all pitch in for, but the times have changed, and coffee and tea are all I get now. I watch YouTube videos for a bit and then plan my classes. 4:30 p.m. — I like to go for a walk after work but I'm really not up for it today; being dizzy constantly is exhausting, so I just walk home and tidy up. My laundry's been hanging up in the middle of my kitchen for a bit too long now. 6 p.m. — For dinner tonight, I'm having an omelet with two eggs, cheese, ham, and spinach, with a carrot on the side and sweet potatoes with jam for dessert. And chocolate. Oh right, and my fiber and medicine. I know they say you're not supposed to watch TV when eating, but I'm a rebel and turn to Netflix for the rest of the night. 8 p.m. — It's time again to wind down with my skincare routine and to brush and floss my teeth. I switch off the main lights and turn on my fairy lights so my brain relaxes more naturally before lights out. Daily Total: $0",2,5
"7 a.m. — I go through the motions and figure out what to wear. I can't explain it, but I seem to care more about what I wear when I teach sixth grade than other grades, which I will be doing today. I put on a blazer before grabbing my umbrella and heading out into the rain. 8:30 a.m. — Wednesday and Thursday are my longest days of the week: I have five classes before lunch and an after-school class from 6:30 to 8 p.m., which I teach alone and make all of the materials for. I haven't yet made any materials for my class tonight, nor did I have time to pack a snack or lunch, so today should be fun. 12:10 p.m. — We have the usual multigrain rice and radish kimchi for lunch, plus tofu with soy sauce, a root vegetable covered in a sweet red sauce, and some sort of soup with beef, egg, and noodles. 1 p.m. — It's time for my afternoon coffee, which I make after downing my many pills and a substantial amount of water. A small part of me worries that the acid in the coffee will disintegrate the pills I'm taking but I always drink coffee anyway. I need the caffeine to focus and plan the class I have to teach this evening. 4:50 p.m. — Since I didn't pack dinner, I'm walking home tonight to eat before going back to work. It's nice to go home and watch a little Netflix, eat my leftover stir-fry, and take my fiber and medicine in the privacy of my own home, but it does make going back to work harder. At least the rain has stopped. 8:10 p.m. — I manage to make it through my after-school class in a good mood thanks to the sweet and hardworking girls I teach. On my way home, I stop at a convenience store for an ice cream bar. $1.87 9 p.m. — I do my skincare routine, write in my journal, and make it into bed by 9:45, only to stare at my phone for a while. It's literally the opposite of relaxing even though I do it with that intention. I really need to fix this habit. I fall asleep around 11. Daily Total: $1.87",3,5
"6:30 a.m. — I wake up a little bit earlier today — a sign that I'm feeling somewhat better — and hop in the shower. On Thursdays, I like to use a quick hair mask because my hair's really over-processed and needs all the help it can get. 7:20 a.m. — I've run out of oats and have to improvise for breakfast. I heat up sweet potatoes to put jam on, grab a banana, and crack open a hard-boiled egg. I eat the oats more out of necessity than desire (I'm struggling with IBS, thus the fiber supplements), so it's kind of nice having a change of pace. I take my usual supplement load, still feeling 87 years old. 8:35 a.m. — I get to school a little late, but I honestly don't care with all of this dizziness going on. At least I'm showing up. Today, I teach sixth grade for three periods and then third grade for two, followed by lunch. Thankfully these are my nicer sixth graders (not to say I have favorite classes or anything, but there are definitely some that are easier to teach...). I can do it. 1 p.m. — I hoped a miracle would happen that would give me early lunch again, but I have no such luck and have to wait it out until 1 p.m. Feeling dizzier than usual, I make my way to the cafeteria, where we have rice, kimchi, rice cake soup, kimchi pancakes, a pork and vegetable mixture, and apple slices. 1:30 p.m. — After lunch, it's time for my fiber and medicine. Since I was only given three days worth of medicine, this is the last dosage I have left. I'm not sure if I'm going to go back for more we'll see. It's also time for coffee, planning my classes, and preparing an article for my weekend tutoring session. 5 p.m. — I walk home for dinner again because I did not have enough time this morning to pack food. Tonight, I'm mixing tuna, bean sprouts, and carrots with multigrain rice for what is probably my simplest meal yet. I'm running out of options and need to go grocery shopping soon. 9 p.m. — With my after-school class finished for the week, I feel so relieved. It's a nice way to make a little extra money but it's definitely a commitment. Now it's time to wind down again. The lights are down, my various essences and serums are have been applied, and I sit down with my diary and laptop. I can't stop watching interviews with the cast. I'm so excited for this movie! I think I'm going to try to see it this weekend. Daily Total: $0",4,5
"7 a.m. — I didn't even pretend I was going to wake up early today; my alarm was set for 7, and that's about when I got up. Still dizzy, but managing. TGIF. I gather my combination of sweet potato, jam, hard-boiled egg, banana, and coffee, grab my supplements, put together an outfit, and happily leave for work. 8:35 a.m. — I've stopped caring about being a few minutes late at this point, especially on Fridays. I saw a fifth grader who was just as late as me run down the street to school, and I couldn't help but laugh. At least he cares. (Students have to be in their homerooms by 8:30, but I don't start class until 9.) Today, I teach four classes of fourth grade and one of fifth before lunch. All of these classes are quite well-behaved, so I'm feeling much better about life today. Things are on the upswing. 1 p.m. — I cannot properly convey the bliss I feel when I sit down for lunch every Friday. I have made it through the week! It's truly a special time. Today's lunch is spaghetti (which I have learned to eat with chopsticks), chicken and rice soup, radish kimchi, kiwis, and something they call pizza that is actually a tortilla wrapped up with cheese, cubed ham, and corn inside. It's not the best-tasting thing to come out of the kitchen, but the kids like it. 2 p.m. — It's time for fiber and coffee. The fiber I take is in the form of psyllium husk capsules, which I get online because it's the only kind of fiber supplement known to not aggravate IBS. I should be planning classes today, but I'm just going to sit at my desk watching more interviews with the cast until I finish at 4:30. I've made plans to go see the movie later tonight with my friends. 6 p.m. — Joined by three of my closest friends, I get on the bus ($1.17) to head to the movie theater. It takes us about 30 minutes to get there from our part of the city. I'm not a very social person during the week, which is mostly due to how exhausted I get from teaching, but on Fridays, I always try to see my friends. $1.17 6:45 p.m. — We go to the theater early to get tickets and are all surprised by how cheap they are. (We're all foreigners living in Korea.) $11.24 7:40 p.m. — Eating out in Korea is a community event; portions are rarely intended for one person. We find a chicken place near the movie theater (fried chicken in Korea is so much better than American fried chicken, and I'm ready to fight about it) where we devour a platter of crispy fried chicken and a side of cheese balls. We split the cost. It's typical to have fried chicken with beer here (there's a Korean word specifically for that), but we plan on having soda and snacks at the movie and thus decide against the beer this time. It's so nice to get together on a Friday and enjoy good food and good company as we share our horror stories from the week. $6.24 8 p.m. — My friend and I decide to each get sodas and then share candy and popcorn, and it only costs us about $10 total. $4.75 11 p.m. — Wow, that movie was fantastic. I definitely enjoyed it a bit more than my friends did, as they'd only seen a couple of Marvel films in the past, but they still had a good time. We hop in a cab, which ends up costing $7.86, and my friend is generous enough to cover it. I walk around with my friend for a little after getting back home (it's plenty safe to do that here, even surrounded by drunk businessmen), and then we go home. 11:30 p.m. — I remember that I don't have chocolate in my house and even after everything I've eaten today, it seems important, so I stop by the convenience store across the street for a bar of chocolate and generic egg cookies (think Nilla Wafers). I eat as I obsessively look up all of the theories about and try to get information about similar things that happened in the comic books to give me an idea of how the next movie will go. I wipe my face with a cleansing cloth and go to sleep around 1 a.m. $2.80 Daily Total: $26.20",5,5
"11:45 a.m. — I woke up around 9:30 today but didn't get out of bed until 11 or so. I'm just now sitting down for my first meal of the day. I still need to buy groceries but I'm putting it off, so my meal is a bit of a mixture of things. I eat a banana and the rest of those egg cookies with peanut butter. Then I fry up the last egg in my house and put it on slices of ham with cheese. It doesn't make much sense, but it's enough to take my vitamins and fiber with. After, I go back to lying in bed, watching cast interviews and reading theories about the movie. I lay in bed until 6 p.m. 7:15 p.m. — After walking around for an hour to get in a bit of activity on my very sleepy Saturday, I stop by a nearby Paris Baguette for a salad, pastry, and juice. I eat the food at home and go back to watching videos before I eventually wash my face and go to sleep around 10 p.m. $7.50 Daily Total: $7.50",6,5
"10:20 a.m. — I wake up to a message from the girl I tutor on Sundays saying she'd like to change our usual time from 3 p.m. to 1 p.m., which is fine, except it means I have to leave my house in two hours. Despite the time restriction, I take time cleaning my floors, dishes, and drains, still with enough time for my two showers. (On Sundays, I hop in the shower to shampoo, then towel dry my hair, apply an argan oil hair mask, do things around the house as I leave that on for 20-60 minutes, and then hop back in the shower to wash it out.) 11:30 a.m. — Running out of options for breakfast, I make a smoothie with what's left of my almond milk, banana, chia seeds, frozen pineapple, blueberries, and protein powder. I have almost nothing left in my fridge but I don't have time to worry about that. I have to get dressed, put on my makeup, and run out the door. 12:15 p.m. — Everything about my tutoring sessions is lovely, except for the fact that I have to take the bus for 40 minutes to get there ($1.17). Thankfully, it's my only expense today; the woman I tutor buys me coffee and even surprises me with salad and a sandwich for lunch from a nearby bakery! She's lovely. $1.17 3:47 p.m. — I'm trying not to buy so many products these days, but I can't help it — my nighttime moisturizer ran out! I go into Etude House because I've been curious about their collagen night cream. I consider getting the essence...but I resist. Just the moisturizer for me today! The lady at the store gives me free samples and a poster of a Red Velvet member; she said I was randomly selected. I love how much free stuff I get here. $15.91 4:20 p.m. — I'm pretty proud that I only bought moisturizer. I take the bus home. $1.17 6 p.m. — Dinner is what is left over from lunch and of my tuna and rice combination from earlier in the week. I'll go grocery shopping tomorrow; for now, I just want to watch . 8:30 p.m. — It's time to wash my face (I love my new moisturizer!) and wind down for the night. The dizziness is getting better but it still hasn't gone away, so I want to make sure I get enough sleep. I end up texting my friend until 10:30 and don't fall asleep until 11 p.m. Daily Total: $18.25",7,5
"6:40 a.m. — My husband left town early for work this morning and bought breakfast ($7.63). (He works from home but travels several days a month, and I also work from home, as a freelance lawyer.) Both our kids are awake by 6:40 a.m. this morning, so I get them changed and then give my son oats with raisins. He fishes out the raisins to eat and loudly proclaims he doesn't like oats (yesterday he loved oats, LOL). I make myself a couple of shots of espresso with our Nespresso machine and froth up almond milk for a faux latte. I take sips of my coffee between trying to coax more breakfast into my son and spoon-feeding baby food to my daughter. $7.63 8:30 a.m. — I put the baby in the stroller, and we walk my son to preschool. I walk back home with my daughter, nurse her, and play with her for a while before our part-time nanny arrives to watch her. Then I head to my ""office,"" which is our guest bedroom. I started working from home this year, and my life is approximately a BAZILLION times better now than it was when I had a full-time office job. I used to make three times as much money as I make now, but I would never go back. I probably lost 10 years of my life from doing that job, particularly after I had a kid. I feel like I have my life back now, and I wake up grateful for it every single day. 9:30 a.m. — I log onto my computer and see an email from Sephora that today is the last day of 10% off for Beauty Insiders. I'm out of moisturizer, shampoo, and conditioner, so I place a big order (First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Cream, Caviar Moisture Shampoo by Alterna, and DevaCurl One Condition Decadence Conditioner). This should last me 12 to 15 months, but (gulp) it's expensive. I get 2.5% cash back on this order through Ebates. I'm that person who always prowls for a coupon code or cash-back opportunity with every purchase. My husband and I are both from families that had no money growing up, and even though we make enough to pay our bills and put money aside, I still have money anxiety. $120.24 12 p.m. — I work for a couple of hours and then heat up leftover brown rice with kale and white beans, which I eat topped with a couple of fried eggs. It's delicious and healthy. I text with my husband while I eat. We're trying to decide when to fly out to see some of his family this summer, so we're comparing airline prices so we can figure out how to see his family without spending a fortune. 3 p.m. — I need to get a few groceries, but my daughter needs to nap. Every parent knows the nap conundrum. To avoid having to get her in and out of the car if she falls asleep, I decide to walk her in the stroller to the grocery store instead. It's two and a half miles roundtrip, and I'm a sweaty mess by the time we're done, but she naps and I get milk, chicken breast, bananas, celery, and bread. After I put away the groceries, I peel a grapefruit from my fridge and eat half as a snack. $25.65 5 p.m. — We pick up my son and head home. I get started on a chicken, rice, and vegetable stew for dinner, using the chicken and celery I just bought along with rice, onion, carrots, and homemade stock I already have at home. I blend some of it up for my daughter as baby food and save the rest for tomorrow's dinner, because it won't be ready until after my son's dinnertime tonight. My son requests an egg and meat burrito, so I quickly make one for him. I forage in the fridge and see that my Swiss chard is on its last legs, so I sauté it with some spinach from my garden and sad-looking red leaf lettuce from the crisper drawer. I eat the greens with a salmon burger patty and some bread. It's a pretty random meal, but I absolutely hate throwing away food, so I try to use up whatever I have in my fridge before it goes bad. 7:30 p.m. — After the kids and I play for a couple of hours, I get my daughter changed, nurse her, and put her down, hoping she'll fall asleep easily so I can get my son ready for bed without hassle. No such luck. She's screaming bloody murder, so I alternate between tending to her, getting my son changed into PJs, reading books, and getting him down in his room. My husband texts me that he's done with work. (He had to pay for parking today ($12.50) and got a burger for dinner near where he's staying ($11.70).) This time around, he's crashing on a friend's couch, so we don't have to spend the 100-something bucks for a hotel room. We chat on the phone for a couple minutes about our days and laugh about our toddler's antics. $24.20 10:30 p.m. — I drink a pot of mint tea. I'm exhausted, so I get in bed with my phone (mistake!). I catch up on the news — so much terrible stuff going on. My mind is racing. I know, I know, never look at your phone in bed, especially when the world is a garbage fire. Working on it.

"5:59 a.m. — Well, my daughter woke me up four times last night, and now my son wakes me up for the day. Feel like I was hit by a truck. He wants to cuddle, though, so that makes me happy, and I gladly cuddle him for a few minutes. My daughter is up shortly after that and we repeat yesterday's morning routine. A couple espresso shots and almond milk for me, waffle with PB&J for my son, baby food for my daughter. 7 a.m. — We're having cement work done outside our house and the cement guys are here. I let them into the backyard. The estimate for their work was $3,300, so it will be painful later in the week when we write that check, but we don't have much choice but to get this work done because the house has drainage/grading problems and we can't let rainwater keep pooling into the base of the house every time it rains. Until we bought this house last year, we'd been lifelong renters, and I really appreciate how easy renting was. I'm still not convinced owning a home is necessarily worth it. 9 a.m. — Walk my son to school. He's happy at dropoff and waves goodbye to me as he runs off to play. Heart bursting. Get home and the nanny is here, so I go to my office and start work. I snack on the rest of the grapefruit from yesterday. My husband had to pay for parking again today ($12.50). $12.50 9:40 a.m. — Take a break to nurse the baby. Back to work. Client calls and drafting discovery all morning. 1 p.m. — Another break to eat lunch and nurse the baby. I eat leftover buckwheat groats with pan-sautéed ground beef and onions. I also grab a small piece of chocolate that a friend brought me as a souvenir from Iceland. I update my work to-do list after lunch before hopping back into work. In addition to being a coupon-hunter, I'm a list-maker. To-do lists up the wazoo, for work, house projects, kid stuff, vacations. You name it, I'll make a list for it. 3:30 p.m. — Done working. I play with the baby and then unload a box of groceries from Sun Basket that just arrived. (We're charged $58.93.) We've been trying a few meal delivery subscription boxes with discounts this month to see if they're worth it. This is my fourth and last one. Even though it's nice not having to think about what to buy and cook for dinner, it's too expensive per meal, so I confirm that the subscription is canceled after this week. My husband texts me that his work trip went really well, so we exchange celebration GIFs. That's modern romance for you. He'll be home in a few hours. Yay! $58.93 5:30 p.m. — Get my son from school and then we play at home. I heat up the chicken stew I made yesterday and the puréed version for the baby. My son loves it and asks for crackers to go with it. I eat a bowl and am still hungry, so I microwave some store-bought frozen mini soup dumplings. They're pretty good. Then I clean up and we play more. My husband bought a chicken dish from a food truck for his dinner before hitting the road ($14.11). $14.11 8 p.m. — Husband just got home, and I'm exhausted. My daughter's been crying and fussing for over an hour since I tried to put her down to sleep, and my son is throwing tantrums left and right. I haven't been able to tend to either kid for two minutes without the other one screaming and needing me. I tell my husband to deal with our son so I can finally get the baby to sleep. 9:15 p.m. — Both kids are finally asleep. I'm dead. I hop in the shower to rinse off the day and it feels so good. 11 p.m. — After hearing more about my husband's work meetings and catching up on the NBA playoffs, we go to sleep. Daily Total: $85.54",2,6
"6:15 a.m. — My son is awake, but I've been awake with the baby four times in the last six hours, so it's my husband's turn to get up with my son. I go back to sleep until the baby wakes me at 7:05 a.m. 7:30 a.m. — Husband made our son a PB&J for breakfast, which he eats with milk. I eat the two bites he leaves uneaten along with my espresso and almond milk. The kids run around while I straighten up around the house a little bit. The baby is fussy so I nurse her, but she doesn't want me to put her down. I've noticed in the past couple of weeks that her separation anxiety is through the roof. It's developmentally normal, so I just try to give her extra loving. 9 a.m. — My husband takes both kids in the stroller to walk my son to preschool and I get 20 minutes of peace to drink my now-cold coffee and eat a banana. I think about the day ahead. We'll have the leftover chicken stew for lunch and then I'll cook up one of the Sun Basket meals for dinner. I have to find a way to get exercise in today. My husband might be taking the day off today to work on house projects, so maybe after I'm done working and the nanny is gone, he can take the baby so I can work out. 11:45 a.m. — After working for a few hours, I'm super hungry and need a break. I heat up chicken stew leftovers and add in the last of the buckwheat groats for an extra boost of fiber and protein. I wish I was having a big sloppy burrito instead. 4:05 p.m. — Done working. Husband and I decide to go to Costco with the baby to check out their fruit tree and flower selection. Guess I'm not exercising today. We don't end up liking any of the plants, but we pick up a couple of organic whole chickens, eggs, applesauce, and beer ($60.28) along with summer clothes for the kids, a summer hat for me, and non-toxic bug repellent for the family ($79.93). $140.21 5:30 p.m. — Pick up our son on our way home. Usually we all eat together, but my husband suggests we let our son eat now and have adult dinner when the kids are asleep. I heat up the last of the chicken stew for my son and the baby, and then my son has applesauce afterward. After they eat, we play with the kids and I chat on the phone with my mom for a bit. 7:30 p.m. — Kid sleep time is a cluster**** per usual, and I'm so glad my husband is home to help. 8:45 p.m. — The kids are finally asleep. I make dinner from our Sun Basket (chiles rellenos with sirloin steak strips, onions, pinto beans, and romesco) and we eat, partially collapsed, on the couch. We drink blonde ales that we got at Costco and try to turn on the latest episode of , but the FXNOW app is literally the worst and it won't play. We eventually get it working and watch the episode about Al/Paper Boi and his Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day (no spoilers). Great episode. All the actors on this show are good, but Brian Tyree Henry is a breakout star. 9:30 p.m. — Aaaaand the baby is awake again. My husband goes in to try to make her fall asleep without me having to nursing her. She screams intermittently for an hour until he gets her asleep again. Meanwhile, I'm feeling a migraine coming on. 11:12 p.m. — Yup, the migraine is official. My husband and I finally lie down to sleep. Daily Total: $140.21",3,6
"7 a.m. — Baby had me up three times last night. Husband woke up with our son at 6:15 a.m., and I get up with the baby at 7. My son is in the backyard watching the concrete guys pour cement, and he is absolutely enchanted with the whole process. He thinks it's the coolest thing he's ever seen. I had the idea to have all four of us stamp our handprints in the concrete while it's wet to create a permanent mark of our family in this house, so we're waiting until the cement is juuuuust right before we do it. We give my son oatmeal and milk, and he eats most of it. Baby food for baby girl. 9:30 a.m. — The nanny is here, and it's just about time to stick our hands in the cement. It goes off without a hitch — all four of our handprints look good, and we run inside to wash the cement off our hands (because it's caustic). I go back out to scrape in our initials and the year with a nail to seal the deal. Looks awesome! I hope 50 years from now someone lives in this house and looks at the handprints and the ""2018"" imprint and wonders about us. Maybe we should bury a time capsule, too. Is that still a thing? 10 a.m. — Son is at preschool, and I'm at my desk, eating a couple of eggs on toast. Still have a migraine, so I really don't feel like working, but mama's gotta bring home the bacon. My husband and I quickly go over our house repair priority list. Now that the concrete work is done, we have to budget for the next thing. There's always a next thing, we're discovering. 12 p.m. — Well, I haven't been very productive. Texting with a friend about her baby shower that's in a couple days. We live a few hours away from each other and don't get to hang much, so I'm excited to see her, her family, and her baby bump :). My husband heads to the hardware store and buys what he needs to finish fixing the clogged drain in the front yard. $42.67 3:30 p.m. — I have to go to J.C. Penney to pick up an online order of swimsuits for the kids and my hubby for our family vacation to Hawaii next month. The option to pick up from the store was $9 cheaper than getting the order shipped to my house. $67.75 4 p.m. — The tank in my car is almost empty, so I stop at Costco to get gas on the way back. I make a mental note that both cars need oil changes as soon as possible. $32.68 4:15 p.m. — I also pick up Costco food court goods for dinner ($8.09). Hot dogs and a chicken bake. $8.09 4:30 p.m. — While I'm out, the concrete work is finished and my husband writes them a huge check. GULP. $3,428 6:05 p.m. — After dinner, we go over to my parents' house to hang out for a bit. We have lemon pie and play with the kids before heading home. 8:45 p.m. — Both kids are asleep. We've been shopping for outdoor furniture for our backyard for months, and we finally settle on the patio set we want. I order it online. $808.17 10:45 p.m. — Baby is awake again, so husband goes to try to get her to fall asleep. 11:45 p.m. — It's not working. The crying is eating away at my soul. I give in and go nurse her. This baby is never, ever going to sleep through the night, and I'm never, ever going to sleep longer than two hours in a row again. Daily Total: $4,387.36",4,6
"7:30 a.m. — Up with the baby two more times last night. My husband got up with the kids and let me sleep in. Love that guy. Coffee for me, and PB&J sandwiches for hubs and son. 8:45 a.m. — Husband walks with the kiddos to take my son to school, and I organize my to-do list for the day. Other than work, I need to get my friend's baby shower gift wrapped before tomorrow, so I look in the garage cabinets to see if we have any non-Christmas gift wrapping paper. I also need to do a load or two of laundry so that the baby and I will have something cute to wear. 11 a.m. — Take a quick break from work to cook up egg whites, which I eat with a couple slices of deli turkey breast in a wrap. Back to work. 4 p.m. — Just finished working, so I crack open a beer. My husband is taking one of the cars for an oil change, and he takes the baby with him to see if she'll nap in the car. We get free scheduled maintenance for the first couple of years since it's a Toyota, so it doesn't cost us anything. I wrap my friend's gift and start on dinner from Sun Basket. It's braised chicken with artichokes and sun-dried tomatoes, which I'm serving with rice I cooked a couple days ago. I finish my beer and feel relaxed. 6:05 p.m. — After dinner, we head over to my parents' house to play and hang out for an hour until it's bedtime for the kiddos. My mom cuts up some strawberries for everyone. 9 p.m. — Both kids are finally asleep. We're wiped. Husband and I collapse on the couch, catch up on the day, and then watch an episode of , a British home tour show. I officially want to move to Cornwall. 11 p.m. — Every night we say we're going to sleep earlier than 11 p.m., but our night owl tendencies are hard to defeat. Sleep time. Daily Total: $0",5,6
"7:15 a.m. — Up and at 'em. My husband plays with the kids while I shower and finally wrap my friend's baby shower present. I gather up everything I need for the baby, since we'll be gone for several hours. Sweet husband makes us all breakfast. Egg and turkey bacon burritos. Yum. Finish getting myself and my daughter ready. 9:30 a.m. — Baby and I are on the road. The baby shower is a couple hours' drive away. I'm praying she naps part of the way, since it's her nap time anyway. 10:30 a.m. — Hahahahahahaha. She's been screaming for an hour nonstop, and I've already pulled off the freeway twice to soothe her. 11:30 a.m. — Hahahahahahahaha. She's been screaming for hours nonstop, and I've pulled off the freeway times to soothe her. 2:30 p.m. — That was a beautiful baby shower. So good to catch up with my friend and her family and celebrate her sweet baby who's coming so soon. I check in with my husband and he says he took our son to get free hamburgers and play in a bounce house at a local shop in town that was hosting a grand opening party. Time to get back on the road. 4:40 p.m. — Yay, the baby napped for an hour and then was content the rest of the way back. On the drive, I get a phone call from another friend who is also pregnant and whose baby shower I offered to throw. We chat for 40 minutes. 6 p.m. — I pan-fry some salmon with sautéed kale, shallots, celery, and chickpeas. We throw it into tortillas and call it salmon veggie wraps. Pretty good. 8:40 p.m. — Kids are finally asleep. We kick up our feet with beers and watch an episode of , a different British home tour show. 11 p.m. — Hi again, 11 p.m. Sleep time. Daily Total: $0",6,6
"7:20 a.m. — Was up with the baby three times last night. My husband is letting me sleep in and taking the kids somewhere. Back to sleep. 9 a.m. — Awake. That was glorious. Head into the kitchen to grab coffee. We decide to head over to my parents' house to hang out. I put on my running shoes and tell my husband I'll meet him there. I jog there and stretch. 10:15 a.m. — Time to watch Game 7 of the Cavs-Pacers series. My mom loves Lebron so much. I decide to root for the Cavs, even though I'm not a Lebron fan myself. Plus, my mom threatens that none of us can come over to her house ever again if we root against Lebron. LOL, my mom is so extra. 12:30 p.m. — My mom cooked us tri-tip, pilaf, and salad. We all eat and decide to put our son to sleep for nap time so we can keep hanging out. 1:10 p.m. — Lebron wins, so my mom is happy and we're allowed to come over in the future. And I'm happy she's happy. 4:30 p.m. — My son has outgrown his shoes and needs warm weather PJs, so we head out to find some. We scour Marshalls, Ross, and Target, and get shoes and PJs for him, a new summer dress for me, and flip-flops for my husband. $108.96 4:45 p.m. — I also order several packs of diapers for my daughter while they're on sale. $80.14 5:30 p.m. — We're home, and I let my son have a PB&J for dinner. Hubs and I are still full from lunch, so we don't eat anything. 9 p.m. — Both kids are asleep. Bedtime routine was a mess as usual. With rum and Cokes in hand, we watch two episodes of and laugh about the weekend's antics. 10:45 p.m. — Sleep time. 11:23 p.m. — Just kidding. Baby was up and crying. Now it's sleep time, at least for a couple hours until I have to be up with baby again... Daily Total: $189.10",7,6
"4:45 a.m. — My alarm goes off, but my anticipatory nerves and excitement already woke me up a while ago. Today is the day I'd been waiting for! I've been training (that's a generous term) for the past few months for my first half marathon. The Brooklyn Half is the biggest in the country, with nearly 27,000 runners. I pop out of bed, take a quick shower to wake myself up, and make breakfast at home — a toasted whole wheat bagel with (chunky, obvi) peanut butter and sliced banana. I'm v worried about getting hungry during the race, so I also stow away a Clif Bar in the pocket of my jacket. I head out into the cold rain and swipe my MetroCard to board the 6 train for an hour commute to the start line at Grand Army Plaza. 10:30 a.m. — Ahh, sweet, cold, wet victory. Crossing the finish line was euphoric! I find my bae, M., who finished almost a half an hour before me, and we revel in our glory. We take a few selfies with our finisher medals (duh), and then over hobble to the medical tent. We're both bleeding and semi-paralyzed from the waist down, so beer seems like the only logical remedy. We head over to Coney Island Brewery and maneuver our way through the dense crowd where finishers are both celebrating and taking shelter from the rain. We order two beers and I treat ($16). First half marathon? Yes. First time drinking a beer before 11 a.m.? Classified information. Feeling accomplished, exhausted, and slightly buzzed, we make our way to the Q train and ride it from one end (Coney Island) to the other (96th street). Despite living only one block and four avenues from the train stop, we are too crippled to walk, and decide to cab it. M pays. $16 2 p.m. — Home, showered, and finally warm, I decide I'm in dire need of Chipotle. My legs are out of commission, so instead of walking, I order it on DoorDash. I have a month of free delivery, so I don't feel that guilty. $17 7 p.m. — Still couch-ridden, M. and I decide to stay in tonight. We had high hopes of post-race celebrations, but the truth is we are BEAT, and the weather isn't helping. We order burgers and fries (M. pays) and watch the NBA playoffs. I'm fast asleep by 9:30. Daily Total: $33",1,7
"11:30 a.m. — I slowly wake up and wonder if my legs are still going to feel like cinder blocks today. M. and I are getting our medals engraved today and then going to my friend's 32nd birthday party. I walk over to our local café for an iced coffee with soy milk and proudly present my fully stamped loyalty card, which scores me a free drink. V gratifying. We hop on the bus to the NYRR Running Hub and get our medals engraved for free. Of course, I am roped into signing up for another race, which costs me $10. Tired and borderline hangry, we decide to Uber to the birthday party, which is in Tribeca. I'm so glad the driver decided to drive through Times Square on a Sunday afternoon, ugh. $25.37 3:30 p.m. — Before the party, we stop at Greenwich Street Tavern (I love this place) for a beer and some much needed food. M. and I split a buffalo chicken wrap, a shrimp wrap, fries, and the bill ($30.67 each). We get to City Vineyard and set up shop for the rest of the afternoon/evening. It's fun to catch up with friends and shower the birthday girl with love. We debate wearing our medals in hopes of free drinks, but decide against it. We alternate pay for rounds of rosé ($33), and enjoy the sunshine. $63.67 8 p.m. — The NBA playoffs are on again tonight, and we have a massive amount of leftover pasta from our pre-race carbo-loading. I heat up the leftovers and mentally prepare myself for the work week ahead. Daily Total: $89.04",2,7
"7:30 a.m. — I wake up to my alarm and feel like I could sleep forever. I begrudgingly peel myself out of bed and into the shower. I have a glass of lemon water, as that usually helps to wake me up. Then I take salmon out of the freezer to defrost, grab a yogurt, and head out the door. When I get off the subway, I stop by the coffee shop near my office. It's a cold brew kind of day. I'm bothered that this shop charges extra for non-dairy milks, but obviously not bothered enough. I have my yogurt and coffee at my desk as I skim through emails. $4.25 1 p.m. — I'm trying to be better about not letting food go to waste, so I brought arugula I had at home to work today. I have nothing to top it with, so I go to the salad bar at the grocery store near my office to jazz it up with grilled chicken and roasted veggies. There are a few good sales, so I also buy a carton of strawberries, two Kind Bars, and a bag of snap pea crisps to keep in the office, plus teriyaki sauce to cook with tonight! $22 6 p.m. — It's beautiful outside, so I decide to go for a run in Central Park. My legs think I'm playing some sort of cruel joke on them, as they clearly have not recovered from the weekend's half marathon. I surrender to their stiffness, and instead sit in the grass and catch up on phone calls. The sun feels amazing. I go home and prepare salmon teriyaki with broccoli and brown rice for dinner. I make enough to have leftovers during the week. Then I cozy up on the couch with my current read, , and M. and I watch basketball all night. Daily Total: $26.25",3,7
"7:30 a.m. — I wake up feeling refreshed and ready to tackle the rest of the week. I have enough time to eat breakfast at home today, so I toast a whole wheat bagel and top it with peanut butter and banana, a classic combo. 9 a.m. — I stop at my usual coffee spot for a cold brew ($4.25), and I'm at my desk by 9. The race that M. and I signed up for this past weekend has a minimum fundraising requirement of $100, so I donate $10 to M.'s fundraiser. We're trying to qualify for the NYC marathon, which means we have to run a certain amount of races by the end of the year. I browse the qualifying races and sign up for two in the coming months — $68 total. $82.25 1 p.m. — Determined to finish it before it goes bad, I brought more arugula for lunch today, this time with leftover steamed broccoli and half an avocado. I pick up our laundry on my way home ($25), and instead of going to pilates as planned, I pick up Indian food. M. and I split the bill. Quite pleased with my decision, I sit on the couch chowing down on chicken tikka masala, saag paneer, and naan. The portions are huge, and now we have more leftovers for the rest of the week. $55 Daily Total: $137.25",4,7
"7 a.m. — I hustle through my morning routine and make M. some tea. He isn't feeling well, and we have plans to go the Hamptons this weekend, so I am trying my best to nurse him back to health! I hop on the train and stop at my coffee shop. I didn't have time for breakfast at home, so I grab a slice of zucchini bread in addition to my cold brew. The bread is phenomenal. I get to my desk and power through some data that I need to have ready by 12 p.m. on Friday. I have a dinner date with my best friend, J., tonight for her birthday, and I'm hoping to sneak out a bit early if I get enough done. $7.75 1:30 p.m. — I FINISH THE LAST OF MY ARUGULA! Is this what being an adult feels like? It's the small victories, I suppose. I eat my boring arugula salad at my desk and find solace in the fact that I'm going to my favorite restaurant for dinner tonight, where I shall eat like a queen. After eating, I head out to the cutest bookstore near my office so that I can get J. a birthday gift. I also need to buy thank you cards to send to friends who donated to my race fundraiser. J. has been into puzzles lately, so I get her a birthday card and an adorable puzzle, plus thank you notes and a sympathy card for a good friend who unexpectedly lost his (very young) doggie. $42.49 later, I feel like a really good friend. $42.49 4:45 p.m. — I sneak out early and head to Soho to check out a dress at Everlane before meeting up with J. I don't love the dress, so I skip it and my bank account thanks me. I take a leisurely stroll through the charming streets of Soho until I arrive at BondST. J. arrives shortly after me and since it's so early, we're seated in large, quiet booth. How romantic! She loves the puzzle gift, and we proceed to order everything on the menu. We split the bill, and while my wallet weeps quietly, my stomach is v happy. It was really pricey for a weeknight dinner, but I justify it by telling myself that it's a special occasion and that I'm a grown @$$ woman. I hop on the 6 uptown and text M., who says he is still sick. I pop into CVS and grab cough drops for him ($5.99). We catch up and relax on the couch before I dive back into and call it a night. $100.47 Daily Total: $150.71",5,7
"7 a.m. — I'm out the door by 8:20 and decide to skip the overpriced coffee this morning. I make a quick stop into the office cafeteria where I grab a coffee with soy and a toasted everything bagel with veggie cream cheese. So good. I really want to finish the project I've been working on today, so that I don't have to worry about it tomorrow. I put my head down and focus for quite a bit. No online shopping, no registering for races, just work! $4.06 2:30 p.m. — I'm not the type to ""forget"" to eat, but I was so in the zone today that I just realized how late it is. I finish off the strawberries I've been keeping in the fridge and nibble on a Kind Bar. I need some fresh air, so I go out for a walk. I stop at Starbucks and order a soy chai latte before heading back to work. $4.98 5 p.m. — I leave work right on time and have to run a few ""errands"" before the long weekend. My first stop is Sephora, where I grab Urban Decay eyeliner ($20.78). I'm tempted to buy all of the things, but I use restraint. Proud of myself, I head over the new nail salon that just opened underneath my apartment, which is so convenient! I choose my color (Clambake by Essie) and plop down in the pedicure chair with . I immediately turn on the massage feature and it is pure bliss. I have been fantasizing about this moment all day. I get my toes and fingernails done and I walk out feeling renewed. The total is $39.90, plus a $6 cash tip — a bit more expensive than my usual place, but they do an impeccable job and it's very clean, so YOLO. $66.68 8 p.m. — I am starving and happy to be home. I pop the leftover Indian food into the oven (we don't have a microwave) and put on . M. is at the gym and I am relishing in the emptiness of our adorable little apartment. I eat my dinner and fantasize about the day that I can finally go shopping for a house. Everything looks like a palace when you've lived in NYC your entire life! The things I would do for a dishwasher or a washer and dryer! Daily Total: $75.72",6,7
"7:30 a.m. — It's finally Friday, and I jump out of bed accordingly! It's supposed to be a beautiful day, and I have a really fun weekend planned. I make my way to the office and try to get there a little bit early, since I have every intention of leaving early this afternoon. I grab a cold brew and some seriously delicious lemon poppy raspberry bread from the coffee shop. I arrive at my desk and prepare for my 12 p.m. meeting. $7.75 1 p.m. — The meeting goes well, and I feel relieved knowing that the presentation needs very few revisions before next week's meeting. I head out and get a chicken salad wrap for lunch. I chat on the phone with a college friend who lives on the West Coast as I eat and enjoy the sunshine. $9.75 1:30 p.m. — I run over to the post office and send out my thank you cards in the mail. The whole transaction feels foreign (I'm not used to not communicating by text or email!), but I feel like a real adult. Also, stamps are expensive. I head back to the office and make an executive decision to call it a day at 3 p.m. I text M. and hope he'll get off early too so we can kick off Memorial Day weekend. $5.55 3 p.m. — I'm out the door and hop on the train home. I go home to change and grab my book, a beer, and a blanket and head over to Central Park. I lay in the sun, ice cold Brooklyn Summer Ale in hand, and finish . Bliss. It's gorgeous out, and in hopes of avoiding Memorial Day weekend traffic, M. and I decide to stay in the city tonight and head to the Hamptons in the morning instead. We head over to to happy hour on the Hudson River, and we make it just in time for sunset. It's glorious. M. buys this round. 9 p.m. — Our bellies full of beer and in need of nosh, we head over to J.G. Melon for cheeseburgers and (the most delicious) cottage fries. We have a beer each and split the check ($24.28 each) before heading to a bar to watch the NBA playoffs, where we have more beer and munch on free popcorn. M. treats. The game ends, and we head over to a speakeasy for a nightcap. We both get silly drinks that are fancier than they need to be. I treat ($39). The service is awful, but the drinks are yummy. We're hitting the road early tomorrow morning, so we call it a night around 12:30 a.m. I have an Uber promotion, so I Uber us home ($5). $68.28 Daily Total: $91.33",7,7
"11 a.m. — I'm staying at my friend's house for the weekend in NYC. We went out last night, but she's one of those people who wakes up every day at 8 a.m., ready to conquer the world. I get out of bed at 10:30, feeling a little hungover. My friend picked up bagels and we have breakfast in bed and chat for a couple hours before she has to leave for a wedding. I Venmo her a few bucks for my bagel. $2 4 p.m. — I finally pull myself out of my friend's bed and walk to meet another friend since it's so nice out. I have my headphones in when I get stopped by a woman on the street. At first, I think she's asking for directions, but when I take out my headphones, I realize she's asking for money. I don't have any cash and try to keep going, but then she asks if I can get her food. I can't say no to anyone asking for food, so we walk to a buffet-style restaurant. I buy her a meal, and we chat for awhile. My heart really goes out to her — her daughter is in the hospital long-term, her husband left her, and she lost her job and her house all in the last year. $17 6 p.m. — I arrive at my friend's house before she gets home, so I go to Starbucks to get a hot chocolate and people-watch while I wait. My friend texts me to come over; she's already eaten, so I swing by Dig Inn to grab dinner for myself. $15 8 p.m. — We Uber from her house to her friend's birthday pregame. I've met him a couple times and really like him, so I'm glad to go. One of the guys made Jell-O shots (I Venmo him a few bucks for them) and we play a drinking game before heading down to a bar in the East Village. I Venmo my friend a few dollars for the taxi and then buy a drink at the bar when we get there ($9). I loved the pregame, but I'm not super into the bar, and I'm not unhappy when my friend says she's ready to leave. We chat and walk around for about an hour before hopping on the subway. Since I'm staying at my other friend's house, we part ways once she reaches her stop. $14 Daily Total: $48",1,8
"12 p.m. — I pack up my bags, add $10 to my subway card, and hop on the subway to see my friend from last night. I'm going on vacation in a few weeks, and my main reason for coming to NYC this weekend was to drop off my Visa documents. My friend is the best and offered to pick them up next week and mail them to me, so I drop off the receipt with her so she can pick them up. $10 12:30 p.m. — I get back on the subway and go downtown to meet up with a friend at a vegan café. I looked at the menu online yesterday and it seemed okay, but I'm super annoyed when I get there and find that the crepes (which make up half the menu) are cashew-based. (I have a nut allergy.) I order a salad and really underscore my nut allergy to the waiter to make sure there's no cross-contamination. He's being rude and dismissive, so I make a stink and end up speaking directly with the manager and chef. The food turns out just fine, but in retrospect I probably should have just left. $15 2:30 p.m. — My friend and I wander next door to get our nails done. We spend WAY too long picking out colors, and I end up having to rush to Port Authority for my bus. It's running a little late, thankfully, or else I would have missed it. I paid for my bus ticket in advance ($20). $15 9:15 p.m. — Get to Boston after what feels like an eternity on the bus. I usually take the train, but this was a last-minute trip and Amtrak prices were crazy expensive. I power walk to Whole Foods when I get off the bus and grab myself dinner from the hot bar, plus four avocados and four yogurts. $13.47 Daily Total: $53.47",2,8
"8:15 a.m. — I wake up and scramble to get to work. I'm naturally a late riser, and morning wake-ups for work are tough. My team has 9 a.m. meetings three days a week, and I'm half convinced my boss set them up just to get me into work on time. I power through the morning, and then my coworker and I go to a café for breakfast. Over the weekend, her boyfriend of two years told her he ""wanted to take a break and find himself,"" so we spend the better part of a hour shitting on men. $8.03 2:30 p.m. — I buy a bag of chips for an afternoon snack. $1.45 4:30 p.m. — After my afternoon meeting, I lock myself in a conference room and have a phone interview. It's for a job based in NYC, and I had a in-person interview a few weeks ago; this is just a quick follow-up with the VP. After my call, I work for another hour before going to the gym and then grabbing dinner at a falafel place on the way home. $8.83 Daily Total: $18.31",3,8
"6 a.m. — I have a ton to do at work, so I wake up super early today. I'm presenting two projects to the VP later this week, and I really want my presentation to shine. I definitely did not get enough sleep last night and feel semi-sick all day as a result. I power through and eat lunch (which I bought at the cafeteria) at my desk. $7.09 5 p.m. — A bunch of work friends and I go to a rooftop bar after work. I'm feeling a little bit better than I did earlier and really enjoy the evening. I order fries (the dinner of champs), and have my friend sneak me three drinks, since I forgot my ID. (I Venmo her back.) My friend lives around the block from me, and we walk home together around 9 p.m. I start tipsy-texting when I get home, which is never a good idea. I text my ex, with whom I broke up about a month ago, asking when I can come around to grab my stuff. I know it's dumb, but we did a Paint Nite together, and my painting is still at his house and I really want it back. No response. Not surprising. I also text a guy I volunteered with, who asked me to grab a drink not long ago. I'm pretty bummed/confused when he doesn't respond either, given that he initiated. $34 Daily Total: $41.09",4,8
"8:15 a.m. — I wake up and feel like absolute shit. I regret not bringing my laptop home last night so I could work from home. I force myself to go to work and then hide behind my desk all day. I get lunch from the caf. $4.40 4:30 p.m. — I go home and hurriedly clean up for my next Airbnb guest. (I rent out my place as an entire home, and just use the back entrance for myself, since leads into my room.) Then I pass out for the night. Daily Total: $4.40",5,8
"8:15 a.m. — Wake up feeling a lot better and get to work. I feel well enough to have lunch with my friends today. Then I have my presentation, which (I think) goes really well! $5.99 5 p.m. — Go out with friends for drinks. Since I'm still not feeling 100%, I just get water. I leave pretty quickly to meet my parents for dinner. We have a standing dinner date every week, but things keep coming up and I keep cancelling, and my parents have been getting very upset about it. I warn them of my sickness but don't cancel, even though I kind of want to. I buy a train ticket (I forgot my CharlieCard) and head out to meet them for sushi and ice cream, which is amazing. They treat. $2.75 9 p.m. — My friend and I talk on the phone and spend two hours booking hotels for an upcoming trip we're taking. We book about half of them before calling it a night, but we're super excited! $299.50 Daily Total: $308.24",6,8
"8:30 a.m. — Wake up a little late, but not many people go into the office on Fridays, so I'm not too concerned. I get into the office around 9:15 and grab breakfast with a coworker. For some reason, the caf goes all out for breakfast on Fridays, even though there's barely anyone in the office. $2.85 1:30 p.m. — I run out and get my eyebrows done, something I've been meaning to do for weeks. The lady asks me if I want to get my lip waxed, too, and I'm more than a little annoyed/insulted. $13 2 p.m. — I LOVE Sweetgreen, and I run there after getting my eyebrows done. I'm always amazed at how their salads taste SO much better than anything I ever try to make! $8.56 3:30 p.m. — Back at the office and am getting a little restless, so I browse Amazon. I saw anti-jet lag face masks advertised last time I flew, and have been meaning to try them out ever since. I buy one for myself and get one for my friend as well. We'll look like fools, but hey, if they work, it's worth it! My phone charger is kind of ripped up, so I buy an extra one while I'm at it ($15). I'm super annoyed because I had an $85 gift card in my account and realize my dad used it. I don't care that he used it, but I wish he had asked — he would freak if I did the same to him. I text him and he offers to pay me back, which I say isn't necessary, but I'm still annoyed. $43.24 6:30 p.m. — I meet up with my sorority little for dinner! I don't feel 100% yet, so I don't want to go out after, but I'm still glad to see her for a bit. We have amazing Mexican food and catch up for a couple hours before the restaurant staff makes it clear that we have overstayed our welcome. We walk together for a bit before splitting up and heading to our respective homes. $25 Daily Total: $92.65",7,8
"8:15 a.m. — It's Monday. I wake up feeling pretty optimistic and ready to take on the day. We'll see if that lasts! I get ready for work, and I'm in the office by 9:15. I grab a cup of coffee from the kitchen and start on mood boards for a new project. 1:30 p.m. — I run home for a quick lunch and make myself a turkey sandwich. BF gets home for lunch right as I'm finishing up, and we chat for a while about puppies. He reached out to someone on KSL Classifieds who's selling a puppy, and we're planning to go meet them after work this evening. I'm a little nervous about getting a puppy, because I feel like we're already so busy with everything as it is. But my BF's heart is set on it, and I guess so is mine. But, y'know, anxiety. 6 p.m. — I head home so we can take BF's car to see the puppy. (One of my car's tires was flat this afternoon, and I filled it up with my portable air compressor, but I'm worried about driving it a longer distance.) The puppy is adorable, but we want to do more research and meet more pups before deciding. 7 p.m. – We have leftovers for dinner and work on our laptops while watching before bed.

"9 a.m. — I wake up thinking it's earlier than it is, and then glance at my phone and exclaim “It's NINE O'CLOCK” to my sleeping BF. I jump out of bed to get ready. It's a beautiful day, so I grab a bike from the bike share station and get to the office by 10. Gotta do better tomorrow. 1 p.m. — I eat a PB&J that I made this morning with a LaCroix for lunch. Going out to lunch always takes at least an hour, and even though I love going out with my coworkers, I wanted to bring in food today since I got in so late. 6:15 p.m. — I head home for the day. My boyfriend is going to a concert with friends tonight, so I'm looking forward to a quiet and productive evening. I make a simple turkey sandwich for dinner, snack on chips and hummus, and then pour myself a glass of wine and set up my laptop to get work done. 11 p.m. — I end up watching the series finale of and drawing on my iPad for most of the evening. Not quite the productive evening I'd envisioned, but I honestly feel very relaxed and rejuvenated, so, worth it? I also remember BF paid our rent today, so I transfer my half from my bank account to his. Daily Total: $0",2,9
"8:45 a.m. — I wake up much too late again. I wanted to get into work earlier today so I could leave a little early (i.e. before 6 p.m.) because my boyfriend and I are going to see puppies this evening! It's raining outside, so I take my car and get into the office at 9:50, just in time to give a studio tour to local university students who are about to graduate with their design degrees and want to see what our studio is like. I try to downplay the fact that I take full advantage of the company's flexible hours and mention that I only “sometimes” get in after “9:30.” A true don't-be-like-me moment. (My employer is really cool about hours, but I always feel lots shame about not being an adult capable of getting myself out of bed when I say I will.) After a 45-minute Q&A/tour with the students, I finally get a cup of coffee from the kitchen and sit down at my desk to get work done. 1 p.m. — Today is our intern's last day, so we're having a little going-away lunch for him at a company favorite Mexican restaurant. I order the daily special (a chicken quesadilla) and my coworker gets the check. What a sweetie. 5:45 p.m. — I head home to meet my BF so we can go see more pups. I didn't get as much work done as I wanted to today so I feel bad leaving early, but I promise myself I'll get into the office earlier tomorrow. 11 p.m. — I think we found our puppy. He's a Goldendoodle and will grow to be about 40 to 45 pounds, which seems like a manageable size for apartment life, and the lack of shedding will be a huge plus. The sellers are asking for $1,250 for him. We tell them we'll sleep on it and get back to them tomorrow with our final decision. Daily Total: $0",3,9
"7:45 a.m. — I wake up (on time finally) and get ready for work. I make a PB&J for lunch again, grab a bike, and get to the office just after 9. Our secretary makes toast with strawberries and sugar every spring when the strawberries come into season, and today is that day! So that's my breakfast, along with coffee. 11 a.m. — I pay our power bill and my credit card bill for the month. I generally use my credit card for day-to-day transactions and then pay it off each month by transferring chunks from my checking account. I do this to build credit and collect points. I've only let a balance roll into the next month once, during a month when I'd made large purchases. 12:30 p.m. — BF wants to meet somewhere for lunch, but I have a 1 p.m. meeting so I tell him I'm going to eat my PB&J at my desk. Kinda bummed because I would love to get lunch with him and talk about puppy decisions. It's all I can think about today! At this point, we're just trying to decide which one out of the two puppies they had that we want to adopt. I'm leaving the final call up to him, because he's been looking forward to getting a puppy for as long as I've known him and I want him to be happy with whichever pup we bring home. 4:30 p.m. — We have decided on the puppy! It's really happening. I text the seller, tell her which one we want, and transfer the $300 deposit to her bank account. I feel simultaneously ecstatic and worried about everything this is going to entail (especially since we live in an apartment and both have full-time jobs). Luckily, both of us work in dog-friendly offices that are walking distance from home, and we have family around to help, so it seems like as good a time as any to get a pup. $300 6 p.m. — My sister is an artist and she's going to have a booth set up at an art festival this weekend. We have a small group of friends over to our house to help fold t-shirts and package prints in preparation for it. I order two large pizzas for the group and tip the delivery girl 20% because she is very fast and nice. $40 11:59 p.m. — We finish all the prep for my sister's art show. It's late, and I feel exhausted and emotional. I'm so grateful to the friends who came to help us, I'm a little overwhelmed about the future but excited about getting a puppy, and mostly just really tired. Daily Total: $340",4,9
"8:25 a.m. — I wake up very relieved that it's Friday, but I'm starting to worry about the puppy paperwork I need to give to our leasing office. Our building is not technically pet friendly, but there are lots of residents who have emotional support animals, and I've had a signed form from my therapist for while, so I need to fill out the info about what kind of animal we're getting and turn it in so they can review it. I'm desperately hoping that they don't deny our request for some reason. 12 p.m. — Things in the office are pretty relaxed today. The weather is amazing, so I decide to join a few coworkers and walk to City Creek for lunch. We go to Red Iguana Express and I get the Friday special and a cup of water. We spend an hour and a half sitting outside, talking and enjoying the weather. $8 6 p.m. — I leave the office and call my mom to see how she's doing. I chat with her while I go to the gas station to fill up my car. $41 6:15 p.m. — I get home and find that I've received a couple packages I ordered online last week: underwear ($34) and new Birkenstock sandals ($144). 9 p.m. — BF and I make pasta for dinner, and I paint my nails while we watch and then go to bed. Daily Total: $49",5,9
"6 a.m. — It's festival day! We wake up, get ready for the day, and get to the festival for setup by 7:30. It's a beautiful day and tons of people are here setting up their booths. It's fun to do something totally different from my normal Saturday routine. BF helps us with setup and then leaves to help another friend with a yard project. My sister and I are hungry by 11 a.m., so we eat PB&Js that I brought with us. I find it odd that this is my third PB&J this week when it's probably been a year or two since I last had one. They're just so easy. 3: p.m. — After hanging out at the booth for a while, my friend and I are starving and decide to leave my sis in charge and walk over to the food truck area. We each get a foot-long corndog and eat on the park lawn while obsessing over every dog that walks by. $7 4 p.m. — It's time to break down the booth and leave the festival. Break down goes quite a bit faster than setup, and my sister takes the booth gear back to her friends' place and returns the rental van while my BF and I head home. 8 p.m. — We go out with friends for a little while to unwind after the festival. We get tacos and margaritas at Taqueria 27, and I get the check to thank my BF for helping my sis out this week. $41 10 p.m. — We walk over to Bar X for drinks. BF pays. After the long day we've had, with a full tummy and two cocktails in me, we go to bed by 11. Daily Total: $48",6,9
"10:30 a.m. — I wake up feeling very well-rested. I spend the first half of the day doing laundry and dishes, cleaning the apartment, and doing some house plant care while my BF runs errands and goes to Costco for a few groceries. I'm very thankful to be with someone who splits household duties with me pretty evenly, even though I'm doing most of them on this particular day. I like today's trade-off though, because going to Costco on Sundays stresses me out. Honestly, I'm just happy any time I get to stay home, pretty much under any circumstance. 6 p.m. — I spend the rest of the day working on my laptop from bed. Dinner is white rice and pork that my BF's mom made and sent home with him earlier today. It's yummy and costs nothing. Daily Total: $0",7,9
"7 a.m. — I'm up and exhausted. It's been a draining week, but I only have to work half a day today! I'm heading home to Dallas this weekend and cannot wait. I was supposed to go home last night but have some things I need to wrap up this morning before I take the weekend off. 11:45 a.m. — TGIF! I head home from the office to finish packing and then call my mom to let her know I'll be on the road soon. I just got a new car last month and I don't know how good its long trip mileage is, so even though I have half a tank I fill up anyway just to be safe. $17.63 3:30 p.m. — People are idiots on the road and I hate traffic. I can usually get to Dallas in about two and a half hours, but it takes me over three today. I walk in the door feeling cranky, but happy to be home. 6 p.m. — After sitting in the car for three hours, I really want to go out and walk around. My mom and I head to our local outlet mall to browse. I try on jeans at Levi's, but get frustrated by the sizing (I'm three different sizes in three different styles) and opt to come back another day. I find a puffer jacket at Columbia that's on sale for $65, which will be perfect for not only next winter, but my upcoming work trip to Minneapolis, so I purchase it. I'm impressed that we're only leaving with one bag! $69.19 8:45 p.m. — My godmother stops by to drop off her dog at our house. My parents are dog sitting while she goes to visit my cousin out of town. We chat for a bit and say our goodbyes as the dogs run around the house. 10 p.m. — In bed and ready to pass out after a long day! I peruse Twitter for a bit before finally succumbing to sleep. Daily Total: $86.82",1,10
"8:30 a.m. — I've decided my body can no longer sleep in, as I am awake at 8:30 on a Saturday. At least I'm waking up at home and Dad is making a breakfast run! All I want is a breakfast taco, so he goes and gets those for my mom and me. 11 a.m. — In November, an IKEA opened literally behind our neighborhood. I wish I was exaggerating, but you can see it if you stand on our roof. I really want this canvas photo I saw there a few months ago, so we load up and head around the corner to shop. 12:35 p.m. — Dad heads to his second job at Home Depot as Mom and I finish walking through the store. I get the photo I want ($49.99), and my mom has a $15 gift card to make it cheaper! I also grab a cinnamon roll ($1) on the way out because, well, why not. IKEA is literally amazing, and I'm so glad there's one close to home. $35.99 2:30 p.m. — I'm tired of sitting around, so Mom and I head to an outdoor shopping mall for a bit. I lost my OU (Oklahoma University) charm on a recent work trip (the chain broke and the charm disappeared into the abyss that is Des Moines, Iowa), so I stop into James Avery to get a new one. Unfortunately, they no longer sell it due to licensing issues, and I resign to the fact that I'll never have one again. I've had it since I graduated high school, and had been wearing it every day. I'm bummed and in desperate need of retail therapy. 4 p.m. — I wander into Francesca's and find a pair of dark grey over-the-knee boots on sale for $15! The only size left is a size 10, and I take it as a sign that I need them ($16.18). I also find a pair of peep-toe booties ($55.30) and after downloading a coupon, decide they're worth the splurge for a good summer work shoe. We hit up a few other stores and I buy a Texas Rangers shirt ($35) for baseball season and a few car decals ($24.34). Thankfully, I've been getting overtime at work and have money put aside for “fun purchases,” so this doesn't hurt my wallet too much. $130.82 5:30 p.m. — We're home with pizza that we picked up from a local restaurant. We've been going to this place since I was four years old and eat there every Friday night. I always have to go when I'm home because they make the best NY-style pizza. We eat dinner with Dad before he heads back to work until 10. 9:30 p.m. — Mom and I watch the school I work for play softball on ESPN and celebrate a victory! I jump in the shower and then watch Netflix in bed for a bit before falling asleep. Daily Total: $166.81",2,10
"7 a.m. — I'm up early to go to 9 a.m. mass with my family. I'm not very chatty at this hour and am thankful that the priest doing today's mass is the quick one. Even with communion taking 12 minutes, we're out of there before 10 a.m. 10 a.m. — Free donuts! The church my parents go to has free donuts on the first Sunday of every month. My stomach has been growling since mass started, so I scarf down a donut, losing some sprinkles along the way. 11 a.m. — Head over to see my grandma at the retirement community she lives in. We eat and hang out for a bit before heading home. 1:30 p.m. — It's a gross day in Texas, and it's going to be even worse when I get back to Oklahoma. Dad fills up my gas tank for me and I hit the road. 4:30 p.m. — I head to Sprouts and I pick up chicken, apples, strawberries, watermelon, granola, yogurt, frozen dinners, veggie chips, and tzatziki. $33.38 5:15 p.m. — I'm traveling for work this weekend and realize I need to replenish my travel-size toiletries. I have to pick up a prescription as well, so I head to Walgreens and get everything there. It's pricier than Target or Walmart, but it's cold outside and I don't want to get out of the car again. $19.85 6 p.m. — I don't feel like cooking anything for dinner, so I cave and get Taco Bell. I try not to eat fast food too much, but some days just call for it! $4 9 p.m. — is AMAZING. I've always loved the musical, and was a bit skeptical of NBC's performance of it, but they did a great job! The guy playing Judas is INCREDIBLE; the set work and lighting is insane. As a former theater kid, I'm very impressed. Some things (namely, ALL the commercials) could have been better, but overall it was fantastic. Daily Total: $57.23",3,10
"7 a.m. — I hate Mondays. Especially Mondays during meet weeks. The team I work for is traveling to Minneapolis this weekend and there is so much to get done in the few days before we leave. I make a granola, yogurt, and strawberry “parfait” for breakfast and grab a frozen meal for lunch before heading out the door just after 8. 12 p.m. — Heat up my lunch and continue to crank things out. I'm down to just one item on my to-do list and it's only lunchtime, so I'm feeling pretty good about today! I send a few emails and update my planner while I finish eating. 3 p.m. — Never. Say. A. Monday. Is. Easy. Just when I thought my day would be fine, I get slammed with multiple projects that are all time-sensitive. Everything has to be finished by Thursday at noon or we won't have everything squared away in time for our trip. I rush through things and hope that printing services can get what we need done in a short amount of time. 5:15 p.m. — Finally out the door and headed home! I'm exhausted after my whirlwind afternoon and looking forward to spending my evening on the couch with reality TV. I call my mom on my way home and sort through a ton of mail before making dinner. 7:30 p.m. — I have successfully been a couch bum since getting home. I grab Thin Mints from my stash in the freezer and curl back up on the couch to watch . 9:30 p.m. — Is 9:30 too early to go to bed? Asking for a friend. I shower, prep my lunch for tomorrow, and climb into bed to watch the season finale of before passing out. Daily Total: $0",4,10
"7 a.m. — I wake up at 7, but since I showered last night, I sleep in a little longer. It's 70 degrees outside right now but dropping to 50 by midday, so getting dressed proves challenging. I end up in a skirt and long sleeve top to hopefully combat the weird weather. 12:15 p.m. — I've been so productive, but it still seems like nothing is getting done. I go to Starbucks with a coworker and get a tea. I'm getting over a case of strep, so the tea helps and is a warm treat on what's turning out to be a cold and VERY windy day. $2.45 3 p.m. — The head of our office leaves at lunch to go home and watch his daughter for the afternoon due to the Oklahoma teacher walkout going on. Two of my coworkers are at practice, and the others took an early afternoon, so it's literally just me holding down the fort. I don't mind it, though. I get a lot of work done and even do freelancing stuff for my mom when I need a mind break. 5 p.m. — I'm speaking at a campus group tonight (Association of Women in Sports Media) and I'm actually really excited. The meeting isn't until 6, and it's about an hour long so I text our volleyball director of operations to see if she wants to grab dinner beforehand. We walk over to Campus Corner and grab a couple slices of pizza. $7.74 7:10 p.m. — Meeting is done! I had a great time talking to the girls, and I'm already looking forward to more interactions with other groups at the college. I'm an alum of the journalism school, so giving back to the place that taught me so much feels great. I call my mom on the drive home, complaining about how incredibly windy it's been all day. 10 p.m. — I get home and spend most of my night watching tattoo shows ( is my favorite). I don't have any tattoos, but I love seeing how amazing (and terrible!) the designs turn out. While watching, I browse through a couple that sales some of my favorite stores are having, but after my spending binge this weekend, I decide I need to take a break! I head to bed around 10:45 and am out within minutes. Daily Total: $10.19",5,10
"7:30 a.m. — I let myself sleep in a whole 30 minutes today because yesterday wore me out for some reason. I cut up strawberries and throw them into a container of yogurt with granola for breakfast. I head to work a little later than normal, but still make it in before 8:30. 10:30 a.m. — A website I love is having a “42” sale today in honor of Jackie Robinson. I've had my eye on a few shirts and a poster print, so I take a look and see if anything I want is on sale. If I spend $50, I get a free ""42"" snapback. I put stuff in my cart but decide to hold off and see if I still want the items later today. 11:35 a.m. — Last night's meeting has me feeling generous this morning, so I decide to join the alumni association through the journalism college. It's $50, but I can split the payments, so I opt to do it in two separate payments with the second not due until October. $25 12:15 p.m. — On Wednesdays we wear pink – and go to the athletic dorm for lunch. Faculty can eat there for just $5, which is a deal, since it's all-you-can-eat! We all get our money's worth and grab cookies on our way out. $5 1:35 p.m. — It always takes me a while to get back in the work groove after lunch. I don't know what it is, but I am always so unproductive in the hour right after getting back. I browse Ticketmaster for concert tickets to country shows this summer and fall, but literally every show close to me is on a day I have a work event or will be out of town. It's a bummer that I won't get to see Dierks Bentley again, but at least I'm saving money? 4:50 p.m. — The last 10 minutes of the work day are the worst. I leave the office right at 5 most every day. I'm an hourly employee, so as long as I have my eight hours for the day, I'm outta here! I text a work friend about my desire for Chick-Fil-A and the lack of one near my apartment. 6 p.m. — The Chick-fil-A cravings are too strong, and I decide to just go for it. I get chicken strips, fries, and a chocolate shake and head back home. $8.25 9 p.m. — Laundry and packing have taken up most of the night, but my friend stops by to bring me a cupcake! She has a work bake-off tomorrow and needs a taste-tester, and I happily oblige. She made the cupcakes and frosting from scratch, and they taste amazing. We haven't seen each other in a while, so we catch up for a bit. 10:45 p.m. — Packing is done and I think I'm all set for the trip. I always feel like I'm forgetting something but I don't know what it could be. I pull up Netflix on my iPad and watch a few episodes of before falling asleep. Daily Total: $38.25",6,10
"7 a.m. — I washed my hair last night before bed, and I currently look like a curly-haired lion, so I get to work straightening it. I've been doing this for close to 12 years now, so I can get my hair straight in just about 30 minutes despite having extremely thick hair. 9:15 a.m. — I finish packing and head out. I didn't eat breakfast, so I stop at McDonald's for a sausage biscuit and smoothie. $4.23 11:45 a.m. — I wrap up everything I need to do for the morning and head home for a couple hours before our flight. I make myself scrambled eggs. 3 p.m. — On the plane and ready to go! We've got a big competition this weekend, and luckily were able to get a charter flight out instead of flying commercial. Flying commercial is fine most of the time, but we would have had to be on two different flights and had layovers to deal with, so this straight shot is so much better. I use the time to get ahead on work for next week and enjoy having a row to myself. 5:35 p.m. — We land and head straight to dinner. On the way, we see that the Frozen Four is in town and the semifinals are tonight. Two other staff members and I decide to go, since Michigan and Notre Dame are playing. Tickets are only $35, so I purchase them on Stubhub and the others immediately Venmo me for theirs. $35 11:30 p.m. — LET'S GO IRISH!!!! An incredible game ends with Notre Dame picking up a 4-3 win with a goal in the last six seconds. We're all a little buzzed after drinking throughout the game. We've basically had one beer per period and two in the third because of last call. I didn't really want to spend $40 on alcohol, but it's not everyday you get to go to a Frozen Four, so it's worth it. $40 12:45 a.m. — We're not ready for the night to end, so we head out to an Irish pub down the street from the hotel. We buy a couple more rounds and take shots (bad, bad idea) and talk with a couple Notre Dame staffers. I pay for my drinks and the round of shots (my coworkers were Michigan fans, so I buy the drink as a peace offering for putting up with my bragging all night) and have now spent more money on alcohol than on tickets. Oh well. $38 1:30 a.m. — We head back to the hotel in Minneapolis and pretty much pass out immediately. We all have to work tomorrow, but tonight was definitely worth the hangover/exhaustion we'll feel tomorrow. (Side note: Tomorrow morning I will wake up to find that my wallet has been stolen/lost. I guess that's the downside of getting a little too lit!) Daily Total: $117.23",7,10
"5:30 a.m. — Wake up, take the dogs out briefly, and have coffee with my husband, H., to start the day. I leave for the gym at about 6:15, and he leaves for work not too long after. I sit all day, every day at work, so my run/gym time every morning is pretty much non-negotiable. When I get home from the gym, I make a smoothie and take the dogs for a proper walk. Our dogs are a high-energy breed and require a lot of exercise, which is fine by me. I shower, get ready for work, and get into the office early because I know I have a lot of work ahead of me today. 8:30 a.m. — Get to work and eat the breakfast I brought — a hard-boiled egg, toast, and half an avocado. Yes, I am THAT PERSON who takes up half the fridge with their food from home. 1:30 p.m. —  Take my (union mandated!) 30-minute lunch break. I heat up my chicken and veggie soup and eat outside with my coworkers so that I actually see other humans today. 4 p.m. — You know those people who are like: ""Omg, I totally forgot to eat today!""? I am not one of those people. It's time for a snack, so I dive into my bag o' goodies in the fridge. Yogurt and berries. 8:45 p.m. — I'm spent, and head home. The good thing about leaving late is that there's less traffic, so at least there's that! I work late often, but I always try to at least get home for dog-walking time so H. and I can catch up and chat about our days. I get home and we walk the dogs, and then go to bed around 10. Daily Total: $0",1,11
"5:30 a.m. — Wake up, take the dogs out. Then: coffee, gym, dog walk, shower. 9 a.m. — Get to work a little early, but not as early as I had hoped. I bought the puppy with me today. I love that we get to bring dogs to work. Grab my breakfast from the fridge (same as yesterday). 11:45 a.m. — I take a break for a little online shopping. On Amazon, I order a book from a podcast I listen to, . There are about 30 people in my position and only three of us are women; that isn't abnormal for my industry, so I like to read books and articles by women about their careers for more perspective. I also buy wireless headphones and organic tampons ($0 for everything, since I have an Amazon gift card balance that covers it). After that, I buy two bras online from Victoria's Secret because the ones I have a basically falling apart ($60). Finally, I buy a skirt and top on ModCloth that have been sitting in my cart for a while ($96). I've been trying to update my wardrobe (slowly), because I am a 29-year-old woman and literally all I wear are jeans and t-shirts or athleisure. $156 1 p.m. — Heat up my lunch and eat while I'm working. I use my break to take the puppy for a walk. 5 p.m. — Snack on plantain chips, blueberries, and almonds. I have to grab a handful of the chips and then put the bag at the back of my snack drawer, or else I will eat the whole bag in a single sitting. 7:30 p.m. — Since I'm working through dinner, I expense a red curry with chicken from a Thai place I like. I'll eat my prepped food tomorrow instead. ($12.50 expensed) 9 p.m. — Head home. On days like this, I'm glad to be paid hourly and make overtime. I'm home before 9:30. We walk the pups and go to bed by 10:30. Daily Total: $156",2,11
"5:30 a.m. — Wake up. Dogs. Coffee. Go to my Orangetheory class, which starts at 7. I really like the workouts, but I've been thinking about canceling because it's a hassle to get to the location. We'll see. 8:45 a.m. — At work early-ish again (my normal start time is 9:30), and I get right to it. Breakfast today is two hard-boiled eggs and oatmeal. I remember that we're out of a few staples at home, so I place an order on Thrive Market for protein powder, almond flour, a few sauces I like, gluten-free pasta, and a couple other snacks. $68 1 p.m. — I heat up my homemade stir-fry and eat outside. The dog walker came today, so I Venmo her. $25 5:15 p.m. — I'm tired — time for an internet break! I have been lusting after the new Volvo XC60, and build one online. It comes out to $48,000. I know I can get a good amount for my car, but still, it's nice not having a car payment. Sigh. I just got a pretty nice raise, but H. and I are working toward buying a house. Even with our combined incomes, we can't afford anything around here. 7:30 p.m. — Eat dinner at work — chicken veggie soup from earlier in the week. While I eat, I research Mexico City because we're planning a trip there later this year. I'm ready to go, like, . 8 p.m. — Producer is happy with my work, and we send cuts to the client. I head home after. H. and I don't want kids but I honestly don't know how people in my industry have children with these hours. It makes me think that's a factor in why there are so few women at higher levels in my industry, which totally sucks! A lot of the men I work with do have children. Their spouses must not work? Or they work part-time? Or work a job with, like, normal hours? I don't know, man. It seems impossible. Daily Total: $93",3,11
"5:30 a.m. — Alarm. Dogs. Coffee. I decide to go for a run today, but when I walk outside it's raining, so I go to the gym up the street instead. I'll run tomorrow. 9:40 a.m. — I'm in a little late for work, but oh well. I swear traffic is always worse on Thursdays. My nine-mile drive takes a maddening 45 minutes, but I have the puppy with me at work today, so I give him belly rubs and everything is better. I eat breakfast while troubleshooting issues I've been having with my computer for the last couple of days. While we're waiting for client feedback, I check in with other producers to see if there are any other projects they need me to work on. Usually, I edit two to three projects at a time, depending on their timelines. 10:15 a.m. — Client got back to us already with notes (that was fast!), so I work on revisions. H. booked plane tickets for a trip we're taking next month to Detroit to visit friends. He tells me I don't need to, but I Venmo him for my ticket. $361 1:30 p.m. — I put in a lunch order through the company today since I have to work through lunch again. I scarf down saag paneer outside with my coworkers and then take the pup outside for a potty break before getting back to the grind. ($13.20 expensed) 5 p.m. — Grab a string cheese and tea. I'm not feeling especially creative today and could use a little caffeine. 7:15 p.m. — My producer left, soooooo ... I'm getting out of here. I go home and eat dinner with my husband! It's a frickin' miracle! Daily Total: $361",4,11
"5:45 a.m. — Morning routine and a run. There's a 7.5-mile route I like that takes me along the beach and back. It's overcast today but still beautiful, and the surfers are out on the water. 9:30 a.m. — Get into work, make my breakfast, werk, werk, werk. It's payday, so I check my pay stub. My increase has kicked in (yay!), and I worked 25 hours of overtime over the last pay period, so there's nice a boost in my check. 1:30 p.m. — On Fridays, some of us ladies at work do a happy hour in the afternoon, and I figure I'll host in my office today. I brought a bottle of wine in with me because we still have so much leftover from our wedding. Gotta have snacks, too, so I run out to Trader Joe's. $12.70 4:30 p.m. — It's lady wine time, the highlight of my Friday. (Or the week?) It's so awesome to have more women working here now. 7 p.m. — I'm home! H. and I walk to dinner at a Mexican place up the street. It's so nice that we can easily walk to places in our neighborhood. I get two tacos à la carte, and he orders enchiladas. He pays. Daily Total: $12.70",5,11
"6:15 a.m. — I wish I could sleep in on the weekends but I'm up without an alarm. I walk the dogs and watch a few episodes of on Amazon until my husband wakes up. He's up about an hour after me, and we go to our local coffee shop. The old guys are sitting outside as usual. A new hipster coffee shop opened in the neighborhood recently, but everyone still goes to the old spot. A latte for me, and a vanilla latte for him. $7 9 a.m. — We make breakfast. H.'s friend is getting married soon, so H. is helping him find a suit today. I clean up around the house — I swear I sweep up a new dog off the floor every week with all this fur! I should just hire a cleaning person. 12 p.m. — I bought a Groupon a while back for a Pilates place, so I use it today. I feel kind of ""meh"" about Pilates. While I'm out, I run a few errands. I stop at Target for makeup remover and a new pillow and walk out with a bunch of other shit ($121). Then it's off to the grocery store to get all our food for the coming week. (We trade off on who pays each week.) I buy chicken, ground turkey, apples, spaghetti squash, cheese, zucchini, broccoli, cauliflower, potatoes, eggs, coffee, and cream ($95). Then I fill up the gas tank ($59). I throw together a salad with chicken when I get home. $275 4:30 p.m. — Weekend happy hour is the best! H. and I walk to our local spot to meet up with friends. We're seeing tonight and have tacos and margaritas beforehand. It's a different Mexican place than last night — ah, the wonders of L.A.! H. pays. 8 p.m. — I buy movie tickets for everyone, and my friends pay me back for theirs ($34 for H.'s and mine). The movie is hilarious and terrible, but the first was a staple for my brother and me back in the day, and the nostalgia is worth it. We go to a bar after; H. has a drink, but I don't want anything. $34 Daily Total: $316",6,11
"6:45 a.m. — I'm up. Head to Orangetheory for an 8 a.m. class. 11 a.m. — We're going to a vintage Porsche show that my husband bought tickets to. H. is a big car guy; I know nothing about cars, but I like to look at them. It's a really cool outdoor event. He looks at all the cars, and I pet all the dogs. 2 p.m. — Pick up lunch from Mendocino Farms on the way home. Their sandwiches are so good! $24 5:30 p.m. — I start cooking a bunch of veggies and protein to meal prep for the week. It takes almost two hours total, but now H. and I both have breakfasts, lunches, and dinners for the week. He helps out, but honestly, it goes a lot faster if I just do it, so it starts with us both cooking and ends with me taking over. 7:30 p.m. — We eat dinner and catch up on . We rewatch the season finale from Season 1 as a refresher (I mean, who can remember?!) and then start the Season 2 premiere. It's a great show, but god, these episodes are long. It's 10 p.m. by the time we're done, and the Sunday scaries are very real. Daily Total: $24",7,11
"8 a.m. — I wake up earlier than I want to on a Saturday, but I can't fall back asleep so I get up. I make myself hot tea and my husband, J., makes coffee for himself and my mother-in-law, who is staying with us this week. She is absolutely wonderful, so this isn't the nightmare scenario that it might be for some people. We all have peanut butter toast on Trader Joe's California Sprouted Wheat Bread and spend the morning catching up. 11:30 a.m. — We have half a bag of leftover arugula that I don't want to waste, so I make myself whole wheat fettuccine with olive oil, garlic, red pepper flakes, lemon zest, parmesan, and a big handful of arugula. Wasting food stresses me out, so I feel good about finding a use for it. 1:45 p.m. — J.'s team (Liverpool) is playing Real Madrid in the Champions League final, so we settle in on the couch for some soccer. I'm not a fan myself, so I spend most of the game reading on my phone and chatting with my mother-in-law. Sadly, Liverpool loses, and J. is pretty down about it. 4 p.m. — J. and I get to work making an angel food cake to use for my grandma's Berry Bavarian Crown recipe. We make Stella Parks's version from Serious Eats, which involves a dozen egg whites, but we have extra eggs that need to be used, so it works out pretty much perfectly. After baking, I pull the cake out of the oven, hope that it's the correct shade of blonde, and flip it upside down to cool. 5:30 p.m. — I snack on chips and salsa, and then J. and I get started on dinner. We already made the carnitas for our tacos, so we just crisp them in a skillet, griddle our tortillas, and make salsa verde from cilantro, avocado, jalapeños, tomatillos, and salt blended together. It tastes amazing. 7:30 p.m. — Even though it's still pretty hot outside, we decide to go for a walk around the neighborhood. I've been in pajamas all day, so I throw on a t-shirt and shorts, put my hair in a ponytail, and slap on sunscreen before we head out. 10 p.m. — We finish making the cake, but we're all so full from dinner that we decide to wait until tomorrow to eat it, and make Amaretto Sours instead. 11:30 p.m. — I shower, brush my teeth, apply retinol, and then read for 30 minutes before falling asleep. I find that reading before bed makes it so much easier for me to shut my brain off at night and fall asleep quickly. Daily Total: $0",1,12
"10:30 a.m. — I wake up later than I usually do, but I guess I'm making up for yesterday. I eat my standard weekend breakfast again (tea and peanut butter toast), and we all relax and chat until lunchtime. 11:30 a.m. — I make the same pasta I made yesterday with the rest of the arugula. Success! I use the rest of it. I share this fact with J., who always makes fun of me for this. 12:30 a.m. — My mother-in-law needs a few things from the store, so I decide to go with her and actually get ready and leave the house today. I curl my hair, apply sunscreen, and then do my typical makeup routine: foundation, concealer, powder, blush, mascara, and brow pencil. 4 p.m. — I practice piano. I took lessons from first grade through the end of high school, but then stopped playing because I never lived anywhere big enough for my piano (which my mom gave me after I graduated). Finally having space for the piano is probably my favorite thing about living in a house instead of an apartment. 6:30 p.m. — J. and I make dinner — leftover roasted eggplant and tomato pasta with a big Italian salad. Meanwhile, we prep black beans and potatoes for tomorrow night's meal and make a big batch of breakfast bars (prunes, pecans, oats, and cinnamon combined in the food processor) for the week. 8 p.m. — It's HQ Trivia time! Ever since I found out about HQ in March, J. and I have been obsessed with it, and we got J.'s mom to download the app so she can play, too. We don't win this game, but J. and I have earned a combined $50 in wins since we started playing. We want to use it for something fun at the end of the year. 11:30 p.m. — We finally dive into the strawberry cake, and it's as good as I remember my grandma's was! Afterwards, I wash my face, brush my teeth, apply retinol on my face, dry shampoo my hair, and read until I fall asleep. Daily Total: $0",2,12
"9:30 a.m. — It's a three-day weekend, so I get to sleep in again. I have one of the breakfast bars we made yesterday with my tea and start browsing some Memorial Day sales. I end up buying three pairs of pajama pants and a bra from Gap. I'll probably end up returning at least one pair of pajamas, but I needed extra to get free shipping. $61.44 12 p.m. — We have leftover marinara sauce that we froze a while back, so I make myself whole wheat spaghetti to go with it and sprinkle it liberally with mozzarella. 12:30 p.m. — My mother-in-law wants to get a new belt, so we help her find one at a local strip mall. I do my normal hair and makeup routine before we head out. We go to Nordstrom Rack, Old Navy, and TJ Maxx, but no dice. She ends up getting workout clothes at Old Navy, but I don't buy anything. I tend to do most of my shopping online — shopping in person sometimes overwhelms me. 2:30 p.m. — We get home and decide to watch The DVD came in the mail a few days ago from Netflix — and yes, we still get the DVDs because some movies aren't available for streaming, and we don't like going to the movie theater. We all agree that the movie was super cute, but maybe not as amazing as we were expecting it to be. 6 p.m. — J. and I make black bean tacos with crispy potatoes for dinner. We top them with cotija cheese, lettuce, and the salsa verde we made. 7:30 p.m. — We all go for another walk around the neighborhood. As we get back, a storm starts blowing in, so we hurry home to try to avoid getting soaked, but then it never ends up raining. We spend the rest of the evening showing my mother-in-law funny videos on YouTube until around 11, when we have strawberry cake. I shower, do my normal nighttime routine, and read until around 12.

"7:45 a.m. — It's the first day of the last week of the school year, so even though I'm tired, I'm excited for summer vacation to begin. I eat a breakfast bar, drink a glass of water, curl my hair, do my usual makeup, get changed, and am out the door by 8:10. I try to sneak out super quietly so as not to wake up my mother-in-law. My students are taking exams today, so I spend the day rereading a great book called , which is all about helping kids find books they will enjoy and giving them strategies to become better readers. 11:30 a.m. — Eat the same thing I always eat at work: peanut butter and apples on an Ezekiel sprouted grain tortilla. 3 p.m. — I cut out of work a little early, since our weird exam schedule leaves me with a break at the end of the day. My mother-in-law heads back home tomorrow, so I'm eager to get home and spend time with her before she goes. I make myself hot tea and eat cucumber slices with ranch dip (this is my everyday after-work snack) to tide me over until dinner. 4 p.m. — J. has been furiously working on the computer trying to find us flights for our trip to Europe this summer. We were originally planning to go to Toronto and Montreal, but last week J. found a two-week river cruise from Amsterdam to Budapest for 70% off, so we made the uncharacteristically impulsive decision to completely change our plans. When J. emerges from the study, he reveals that for some reason it was cheaper for us to fly business class to Amsterdam, so we're going to get to see how the other half lives ($4,200). We'll still be in economy on the way back, but hey, I'll take it! We spend the afternoon excitedly researching the amenities that are included with our flight. We are fairly big cheapskates in our normal lives so that we can afford to travel often and also put a lot of money into savings and investments. $4,200 6:30 p.m. — We eat leftover black bean and potato tacos for dinner. 8 p.m. — We play HQ, but none of us win. Afterward, we rent on Amazon because my mother-in-law has never seen it, and we all love Melissa McCarthy. When the movie is over, we have cake, and I hug my mother-in-law and say goodbye since she'll still be asleep when I leave for work tomorrow. I get ready for bed and read until midnight. $3 Daily Total: $4,203",4,12
"7:45 a.m. — I get up and eat a breakfast bar, do my hair and makeup, and I'm at work by 8:15. Today is another exam day, so I work through my end-of-year to-do list to make sure I'm ready for next school year while my students are testing. 11:35 a.m. — Eat my peanut butter and apple wrap and respond to emails during my lunch break. 2 p.m. — I meet with my Language Arts team, and we find out the principal found us money to help buy books for our classroom libraries. This is super exciting, because we've all spent our personal money buying books for our students, and now we won't have to anymore! Then another teacher and I spend time prepping a presentation about finding and sharing culturally diverse novels with our students. We're presenting at a district training event next school year, and we want to be ready. 4:20 p.m. — Time for cucumber, hot tea, and scrolling through Instagram and . The house feels a bit lonely without my mother-in-law here, and I can tell that J. is pretty bummed, so I give him a hug. 6:30 p.m. — J. eats leftover black bean and potato tacos and I have barbecue and macaroni and cheese that was left over from J. and his mom's lunch before he dropped her off at the airport. The place where they went  was ranked as one of the top 10 barbecue joints in the world, and I'd say it lives up to the hype, even reheated. 8 p.m. — We play HQ, watch TV, and eat the last of the cake. Then I play piano while J. takes a shower. I'm currently in the process of learning ""Winter"" by Tori Amos. I shower and get ready for bed before reading. Daily Total: $0",5,12
"7:45 a.m. — It's the last day of school (with students at least — I still have to go in for a little while tomorrow)! I can't believe how fast the year went, but then again, I always feel this way. I eat my breakfast bar, get ready for work, and decide that today is a jeans kind of day. 11:30 a.m. — I eat my apple and peanut butter wrap and get a few things done around my classroom before my students come back. They finish their exams super early, so I put on a movie, but they're way too hyper to pay any attention. I finish putting all my grades in my grade book, and then triple check them. 2 p.m. — The kids are gone, and it's time for our annual end-of-year auction. Businesses donate items that we bid on using bucks that we earn from our fellow teachers for helping each other out. We have to write a reason on the bucks, and I hope no one notices or cares that one of my friends wrote ""hooker,"" her favorite thing to call me, on one. I bid on some things, and end up winning $55 worth of gift cards and three t-shirts. Yay me! I collect my winnings and head home early. 4 p.m. — I try to drink water, but our fridge's dispenser won't work. Several YouTube videos later, we discover that the water has frozen in its reservoir, so I become the crazy person blow-drying my fridge. It works! YouTube home improvement videos have saved us a lot of money. 6:30 p.m. — J. has leftover black bean tacos, and I eat the last of the roasted eggplant pasta for dinner. This turns out to be a mistake — I don't know if I'm just tired of it or if it's because I used mozzarella instead of parmesan tonight, but I can barely eat it. I choke down a little over half before giving in and throwing the rest away. We play HQ, and then I play piano while J. goes for a run. 11 p.m. — I'm starving, so I eat a bag of animal crackers that I snagged from work a couple of weeks ago. They are surprisingly tasty. I shower, get ready for bed, and read until 12. Daily Total: $0",6,12
"7:25 a.m. — I wake up before my alarm, but I decide to just get up and head to work early so that I can leave as quickly as possible. It's my last day, so I'm pretty keyed up. I eat a breakfast bar, get ready, and get to work just before 8. 10 a.m. — I lock away the last of my things and finish the final few items on my to-do list. I'm not 100% ready for the next school year, but I feel good about the way I'm leaving things. I turn in my keys and head home for the summer. J. is still in bed when I get home, as today is one of his last days off before he starts teaching summer school. 11:30 a.m. — We go to Costco to pick up razor and electric toothbrush refills ($50) and pecans, and then impulse buy habanero chicken sausages after sampling them. We also grab lunch (I have pizza, J. has a hot dog) at the snack bar. $124 12 p.m. — We go to the grocery store and buy strawberries, bananas, spinach, bell peppers, cucumbers, onions, cabbage, ginger, tomatoes, cheese, olives, artichoke hearts, beans, half and half, peanut butter, sugar, and spaghetti. I always plan our meals and make a list so that we don't overspend. Today is the first time I've been to the grocery store in months, because J. usually does it while I'm at work. He's been working mostly from home this year because Hurricane Harvey destroyed the campus where he teaches, so he does more of the housework than I do. $57 6:30 p.m. — We always eat out on Friday nights, and tonight we go to a Korean place that we first tried a few months ago. We were scared they may not still be in business because it wasn't very crowded when we went, but we check their Yelp page, and they appear to be going strong! We have dumplings and bibimbap with bulgogi and banchan. It's all delicious, and we're both stuffed. $37 8 p.m. — We play HQ, watch , and then J. plays FIFA while I read, play piano, and watch Lisa Eldridge's latest tutorial. I stay up way too late because hey, it's summer! I end up going to bed around 2 a.m. Daily Total: $218",7,12
"7:30 a.m. — It's Sunday! I wake up for the day, thanks to my daughters (four-years-old and 14-months-old). My husband is already gone, as he is dropping my parents off at the airport this morning. I get the girls dressed and fed, then load them up to head to the grocery store to pick up our weekly order. Every Saturday, I plan our meals for the week and place an online order for pickup on Sunday morning. It is a lifesaver with a toddler and a baby, and it's free with any order over $100. We typically spend about $130/week on groceries. I have saved so much money by not aimlessly wandering the aisles. This week I get ground beef, Italian sausage, mozzarella, chicken breasts, brats, juice boxes, applesauce pouches, guacamole singles, avocados, bananas, noodles, milk, buns, bread, chopped salad, General Tso's Chicken, rice, three veggie steamer bags, grapes, strawberries, blueberries, tomatoes, onions, green and red peppers, asparagus, sliced cheese, protein bars, yogurt, Diet Coke, and deli turkey. $112.73 9:15 a.m. — Arrive home to unload the groceries, and my husband is back home too. I give the girls a snack of Goldfish before putting the baby down for her morning nap. Then I prepare a homemade lasagna for one of my best friends who just had her second baby. I know how hectic things are right after having a baby, especially the second one, so I'm planning to drop this by her house during the week for her and her husband and toddler. It should last them a few days! Then I shower and blow-dry my hair, as I'm going to a show in Minneapolis with a college friend tonight. 11 a.m. — Old Navy is having a 40% off sale, and I love their basics. I order three tanks and a T-shirt for myself, two shirts and leggings for my toddler, and matching shirts for the baby and toddler ($91.80). I notice we're almost out of diapers, so I order more on Amazon ($30.59). $122.39 11:30 a.m. — I feed the girls lunch (macaroni and cheese and strawberries) and snack on cheese and crackers while doing laundry and mild cleaning. We load up the girls in the double jogging stroller and my husband runs and I rollerblade to a park a couple of miles away. It feels so good to be outside and have the girls run around and get some fresh air! 3:30 p.m. — I finish getting ready for the show tonight and make sloppy joes for my husband to eat for dinner while I'm out. My husband is an amazing father and so involved with our girls. He's always willing to watch them so I can get out occasionally, and I try to make sure he does the same. I head to Minneapolis to meet one of my best friends from college and a couple of her friends for dinner and a show. 5:15 p.m. — We decide on a brewery next door to the theater, since my friend broke her foot last night and can't walk very far. I order a Moscow Mule, cheeseburger, and fries. YUM. I usually cook dinner during the week and try to prepare relatively healthy meals, so I love splurging on the weekends. I'm glad we had this time before the show to catch up, as we live far from each other and are both busy with our families. $28.54 9 p.m. — The show is over and we loved it! It was the Cat & Nat Fun Show. They're moms who basically got famous from making hilariously honest YouTube and Facebook videos about the realities of motherhood. They are a hilarious duo. It's rapidly approaching my bedtime, and I'm happy to be on my way home at a decent hour for a Sunday night. Unfortunately, the parking lot is super crowded with only one parking attendant, so it takes me 45 minutes just to get out of there. I pay for parking ($13) and reimburse my friend for the show ticket ($66). Get home around 10:30, wash my face, and crash. $79 Daily Total: $342.66",1,13
"5:45 a.m. — Wake up at my usual time to shower, get dressed, blow dry my hair, and do my makeup before my girls are up. 6:30 a.m. — Now the fun begins. I wake up the toddler, put on one of her favorite shows, and get her milk. While she wakes up, I pack her lunch for the day (chips and guac, tomatoes, applesauce, and grapes). Then I wake up the baby, feed her, change her, and get her dressed for the day. Next, I get the toddler dressed. She'll never let me help her get dressed until the baby is ready because, well, she's a toddler. You learn to pick your battles. I pack up my daughter's bags for preschool, grab a yogurt and protein bar for myself, and we are out the door. 8:15 a.m. — Arrive at work after dropping the toddler at preschool and the baby at daycare. I make a cup of hot tea from an assortment I keep in my desk drawer and drink that, along with the yogurt and protein bar from home. I settle in for a morning of catching up. I just started this job three weeks ago, and one of my staff members gave notice on my third day, so it has been a hectic ride trying to learn the company and both my position and hers before she left. Her last day was Friday, so now I need to catch up and focus on some things that have been on the back burner. 12:15 p.m. — I normally try to pack my lunch, but realistically, it only happens two or three times per week. Being a working mom can be a little crazy at times, so I try to give myself a break in this arena. Plus, I enjoy a good excuse to get out of the office a couple of times per week. I head to Subway (not my favorite, but the most convenient) and grab a turkey guacamole wrap, Baked Lays, and a Diet Coke. I bring it back to my office to eat while I work. $10.48 4:45 p.m. — After spending the afternoon reviewing and updating our capital expenditures and budget, I am ready to head home. I have my first meeting with the company owners on Wednesday to discuss this information, so I am trying to prepare as much as possible before then. I identified some glaring mistakes made by my predecessor, so I am sure I will have some explaining to do on some of the changes. But one rule that I always try to follow as I navigate my career is to do everything I can to avoid throwing anyone under the bus. 5:15 p.m. — Arrive home and start making dinner for the family. I'm craving Mexican food, so I make ground beef nachos with cheese, onions, green peppers, lettuce, and salsa. Then we get the girls in the jogging stroller and head out for a run. We do a two-mile loop, and the toddler gets out and runs with us for parts of it. It is so fun to involve her more as she gets older! She just loves it and is so proud when she can do the same things we're doing. Proud mama moment. 8 p.m. — Get the girls in their pajamas and in bed. They always want me to sing them a couple of songs before I leave the room. (They are literally the only two people in the world that enjoy my singing voice — I am the worst singer!) I relax with my husband and we catch up on our days before passing out at 9:30. Daily Total: $10.48",2,13
"6 a.m. — Up later than usual and rushing to get ready. After I shower and get dressed, I blow-dry my hair and then set up the toddler with a TV show and her milk while I finish getting ready. I pack my lunch and breakfast for the day, and then wake up the baby to get her changed, fed, and dressed. My mother-in-law arrives because she watches the toddler on Tuesdays and Thursdays. We are so thankful for her and the close relationship they have developed because of this. I leave for the day with the baby on my hip. 8:15 a.m. — Arrive at work after dropping the baby off at daycare. Eat a protein bar and sip on iced tea. I get an email from HR telling me that the staff accountant I extended an offer to on Friday has accepted the position. This is such a relief and a weight off my shoulders! She'll be starting in two weeks, so I need to start developing a plan to get her trained and starting off on the right foot. This will be a challenge, since I myself have been here for less than a month. But I was very honest and upfront during the interview process that it will be a team effort for a short time until I get everything squared away. She seems ready and motivated, so I am happy about this hire! 11:30 a.m. — Well, that protein bar didn't tide me over for too long. I am always so hungry the day after I work out at night. I grab the lunch I brought from home — turkey and cheese sandwich, chips and mini guac, grapes, and a Diet Coke — and work my way through it while sending off a couple of emails. 5:30 p.m. — I stop for gas on my way home from work. I typically fill up at least once a week with all of the commuting I do. Our neighbor drops of her 17-month-old daughter because she has to teach a class tonight and her husband had surgery today, so we agreed to watch her for a few hours. My husband grills cheddar brats for dinner while I prepare an Asian chopped salad and watch the girls. After dinner, we take the three girls on a long walk around the neighborhood. $30.39 8 p.m. — Our neighbor picks up her daughter and we get the girls ready for bed and put them down for the night. I sneak a couple Double Stuf Oreos while I settle in to review my brother-in-law's résumé and cover letter that he asked me for pointers on. I finish up and shoot him an email with some tips. Husband and I watch an episode of before going to bed. Daily Total: $30.39",3,13
"5:15 a.m. — Up early this morning to get in a strength training circuit before my normal morning routine. If I don't do it in the morning, it won't happen. I lift weights in the basement for about 30 minutes before showering and getting ready for the day. My husband leaves just as I'm finishing my workout. I pack lunches for myself and my daughter and get both girls dressed, fed, and ready. It's the usual routine, except the baby is glued to me this morning for some reason. I can't complain about the extra snuggles, though. We hit the road for drop-offs. 8:15 a.m. — Settle in at my desk with a yogurt I brought from home. I spend a good chunk of the morning preparing for my meeting later today with the owners and CFO. I also draft and propose my first process change to the team. I tend to err on the side of getting to know the company and the current processes well before proposing a change. This was one of the reasons I was hired though, and this is a minor change so it's a good place to start. Thankfully, everyone is open to my idea and willing to work through it together. 9:30 a.m. — Need a caffeine boost. I make hot tea from my desk drawer. 11:45 a.m. — Since I know I'll get hangry if I don't eat before my meeting, I grab my lunch from the fridge and dig in — sharp cheddar cheese and crackers, strawberries, raw green pepper slices, and Diet Coke. 4:30 p.m. — Head home for the day. I grab the lasagna I made on Sunday and drop it off with my friend who just had a baby. 6:30 p.m. — Home from my friend's house. Her new baby boy is so precious and perfect. Dare I say I want another one?!? I make General Tso's chicken, rice, and asparagus for dinner. Then I give the girls a bath and get them ready for bed while my husband cleans up the kitchen and does the dishes. I put the girls to bed while my husband goes on a run. When he gets back, we watch an episode of , and then I wash my face and pass out around 9:30. Daily Total: $0",4,13
"6 a.m. — I sleep in today since my mother-in-law is coming, so I only have one drop-off. (My husband leaves early every morning so that he can get off work in time to pick up the girls.) I do my usual routine — shower, get dressed, blow-dry my hair, and do my makeup. The toddler wakes up around 6:30, so I get her settled in to watch her favorite show. The baby wakes up while I'm getting ready, so once I'm done I get her up, feed her, change her, and get her dressed for the day. My mother-in-law shows up, we catch up for a few minutes (we have a great relationship), and then the baby and I head out. I grab iced tea and a protein bar on my way out. 12 p.m. — I spend the morning with a coworker going through some tasks, and we discuss the reality of how ancient/inefficient many of the processes here are. I'm feeling a little stressed about everything that needs work, so I leave the office for a bit to get fresh air. I remind myself that I love a good challenge, and there is a great opportunity to make improvements here. I get a car wash ($10), and then grab a chicken Philly sandwich, Mrs. Vickie's kettle chips, and a Diet Pepsi (11.40). Head back to office to eat and get back to work. $21.40 5:15 p.m. — Home from work. We have a coupon for Panera that expires soon and it's beautiful out, so we decide to go pick up dinner and eat it at the park. I get a chicken Caesar salad, my husband gets a BBQ chicken flatbread and a Southwest salad, and we order a tomato soup kid's meal for the toddler. I bring snacks for the baby. We drive to the park and settle in to eat. Five minutes in, the baby grabs the toddler's cup of soup and dumps most of it out, which results in meltdown central and a huge mess. Sometimes things just don't go as you envision them with young kids. But, the toddler forgets about it quickly and is so excited to be at the park. She even makes a new friend. I love how friendly and social she is with other kids — I am not sure where she gets it! $19 7 p.m. — We're low on milk (which is a major crisis in our house), so we stop for two gallons on the way home from the park. $6 8:15 p.m. — Get the girls settled into bed. We wind down with an episode of , which I don't even make it through before falling asleep. I wash my face and head to bed at 9:30, and my husband is not far behind me. Daily Total: $46.40",5,13
"3:30 a.m. — Up with a crying baby. I normally let her cry for a few minutes because she usually falls back asleep, but this morning it continues to escalate, so I give in. I feed and change her and put her back to bed. Then I fall back asleep. 5:15 a.m. — It takes every ounce of my willpower, but I get up to get a workout in this morning. I do an upper body strength training circuit. Then the usual routine — shower, get dressed, blow-dry my hair, put on makeup (primer, foundation, mineral veil, mascara). I make my daughter's lunch for preschool while she watches TV. The baby isn't up yet, so I wake her, and she does NOT want to wake up today. (Gee, I wonder why, Miss 3:30 a.m. snack!) I get them both ready and we head out for drop-offs. TGIF! 8 a.m. — I stop at the gas station on the way to work for a sugar-free Red Bull and a donut (breakfast of champions, I know). $5 12:15 p.m. — After a productive morning, I leave the office to grab a chicken sandwich and a Diet Coke. $7.87 5:15 p.m. — Home from work. I ordered the new Fitbit Versa Smart Watch last week, and it arrives today! I got a deep discount through my company's wellness program. I've never had a Fitbit, so I'm curious to see if it'll actually encourage me to move more throughout the day. 5:30 p.m. — Our neighbors invite us over for an impromptu pizza party. I pack up food for the baby and the diaper bag, and we get the girls in the stroller to walk up there. It's about a half mile walk. We spend the evening relaxing, chatting, and eating pizza, salad, and strawberries, while our girls play with their daughter. They pay. We trade off hosting dinners with each other, and usually whoever is hosting provides the food. 8:30 p.m. — Home from our neighbor's house to get the girls ready for bed. The baby seems to be running a low grade fever and has a runny nose. I really hope she isn't sick all weekend. I have a feeling she might be cutting a tooth, but it's always hard to know for sure, because those symptoms can be very similar to cold symptoms. I get the baby in bed and snuggle with the toddler for a little bit before putting her to bed. We watch an episode of while I get my Versa watch all set up! I am loving it so far. Head to bed around 10. Wild Friday night y'all! Daily Total: $12.87",6,13
"12 a.m. — The baby wakes up crying. I had a feeling this would happen with the condition she was in at bedtime. Thankfully, my husband gets up, feeds her, and changes her, and she goes right back to sleep. 6:45 a.m. — The toddler wakes up and comes in our room. Surprisingly, she is requesting that Daddy get up with her (oh, darn!). I stay in bed for another hour or so, and then the baby wakes up. I go grab her and we join my husband and the toddler. The baby is a little warm, and her nose is runny, but she is happy. It is such a beautiful morning! We live on a river and the water is so calm as the sun rises this morning. There have been rare pelicans in the area all week, and this morning they're hanging out right in front of our house! They are huge and so cool to watch! 8 a.m. — Breakfast time! My husband and I each eat a bowl of Raisin Bran. I make the toddler a bowl of oatmeal that she devours and cut up a banana for the baby. I love a relaxing Saturday morning after a long week! I spend the morning cleaning, doing laundry, and playing with the girls while my husband does some work on the basement. The baby goes down for nap at 10:30. 11:30 a.m. — Lunchtime! My husband eats leftover sloppy joes, I have a bagel, and the toddler has yogurt and a bagel. The baby wakes up around noon and I feed her turkey and cheese. 1 p.m. — The girls are in desperate need of new shoes for spring, so I take them out shopping while my husband continues to work on the basement. We head to Kohl's and I find matching Nikes for them (so cute!). My toddler loves them too, which is a bonus. The girls are behaving really well, so I decide to browse the women's section. I'm in search of a particular pair of pants, but they are wiped out of sizes. We don't get out shopping very often, so I seize the moment and grab quite a few items to try on. I end up buying an open front sweatshirt, a floral shirt, a lavender cardigan, and a workout tank ($150.23). We stop for chocolate Frosties on the way home — one for me and one for the toddler ($3.41). $153.64 4 p.m. — My husband and I are meeting another couple for an early dinner, so we drop the girls off with my mom and dad. We're very fortunate to have both sets of parents close by to watch the girls when we want some time away. Our friends suggest a local scratch kitchen that we've never been to, and it does not disappoint! I have two glasses of wine and carnitas tacos. My husband has two Old Fashioneds and short ribs. This was a spendy dinner for us, but we really enjoy the relaxing evening catching up with our friends with delicious food and drinks. It's worth every penny! $75.24 8 p.m. — We aren't quite ready for the night to end and we've had enough cocktails, so we decide to head to a local ice cream parlor. We each get two scoops. We treat, since they paid for an appetizer at the restaurant. Time to pick up the girls and head home. Our date nights just aren't as late as they used to be! But I am grateful for a night of fun and relaxation. $16.50 Daily Total: $245.38",7,13
"6:15 a.m. — I wake up before my alarm because I went to bed really early last night. I've been grappling with depression lately, though, and I'm pretty unhappy at my job, so I hit snooze and sleep again for as long as I can. 7:50 a.m. — Okay, okay. Up, showered, and out the door. If I leave the house by 8:30, I can be at my desk by 9. After years of living in D.C., where the subway was always broken, I'm grateful for my short commute here. 9:15 a.m. — I bring breakfast from home (cottage cheese and two slices of Dave's Killer Bread) but grab coffee from our subsidized corporate cafeteria. The charges come directly out of my paycheck, post-tax, which can sneak up on me sometimes. $1.50 1 p.m. — Grab salad, pasta, and tofu from the cold bar downstairs. Spend lunch at my desk reading a piece on LongReads.com about life as a woman in an oilfield town. $5 6 p.m. — Get home. I was going to go for a run, but…it's colder than it looks outside. Instead, I throw together avocado, pico de gallo, and rice from the fridge and work on my to-do list for the week while catching up on . 8 p.m. — I always go to weekly trivia at a nearby dive bar with friends — it's nice to have something to look forward to when you have a case of the Mondays. I have two vodka sodas and tip generously because I always come to this bar and they take care of me. I also sneak bites from everyone's Chinese takeout because I'm the worst. $20 Daily Total: $26.50",1,14
"7 a.m. — Wake up to my boyfriend's Venmo payment for his portion of a recent trip I booked for us. I immediately transfer the $700 to my savings. 9 a.m. — I make cottage cheese and toast for breakfast, and then cash in on a surprise free drink coupon from Starbucks. It's so nice being able to spend extra time outside on a beautiful morning. 9:45 a.m. — It's almost skirt season in New York, and I realize I somehow have no nude color work shoes. After wasting so much money on cheap-ish flats that I only wear once due to killer blisters, I've accepted that I need to be picky about my shoes. I'm obsessed with Rothy's and consider them well worth the splurge, given how much I walk. I place an order for my third pair. $145 12:15 p.m. — It's a beautiful day, so I spend lunch just strolling the neighborhood. I stop by the office cafeteria for a salad on my way back and escape to a windowed conference room for the rest of the day to do legal analysis in natural light. $5.80 5:45 p.m. — I meet someone from my grad program for networking drink. We have way more in common than I expected; I think I may have just made a friend? TBH, I don't know how this works in the adult world. $24 8 p.m. — I know better than to go to the grocery store hungry, but here we are. I pick up LaCroix, Triscuits, cottage cheese, chorizo, artichoke dip, cheese, and dessert hummus (?). A few things are on sale, so I get doubles. $44.30 8:45 p.m. — My boyfriend is traveling for work, so I turn the dip, chorizo, and Triscuits into a bizarre mezze plate for dinner. Then I throw on a sheet mask and browse job boards before bed. Daily Total: $219.10",2,14
"9 a.m. — It's pouring, and I just want to stay in bed. But I have important meetings today and want to look especially professional. I get to work and realize I forgot to bring anything for breakfast, but luckily someone brought in bagels — score! I grab a coffee downstairs. $1.50 12:30 p.m. — My two important meetings were cancelled, and I'm pissed about it. One was to discuss the future trajectory of my role, and has been pushed several times now. I find myself getting mad at work a lot lately…another sign that I need to keep my options open. I run downstairs for lunch before an afternoon of meetings. $6.60 3:30 p.m. — Someone brought Girl Scout cookies to our meeting marathon, and I snack all afternoon. 6 p.m. — My friend is moving soon, and she invites me over for dinner. I buy a bottle of wine to bring as a belated birthday present, and we catch up while packing her kitchen. $13 9:30 p.m. — I'm tired and don't feel like facing a 45-minute train ride home. Uber to the rescue. $15.45 Daily Total: $36.55",3,14
"8 a.m. — I'm working from home this morning because I have a doctor's appointment, and I manage to squeeze in a phone interview for another job beforehand. It's so hard to interview when you don't have a private office! The position is in another city, but I'm more focused on getting back into the interview game than on the logistics of this specific position. I run to grab an iced coffee with my birthday coupon before it expires. My interview skills run on Dunkin'. 11 a.m. — The interview goes over our scheduled time, and I'm running late for the doctor. I grab an Uber, and the ride there lasts longer than the appointment does. I get some lab work done. $9.90 12:30 p.m. — Get to the office, and I'm starving. I grab a fried chicken sandwich from the cafeteria. $6.90 4:30 p.m. — I sneak out a little early to go for a run in Central Park. The cherry blossoms are in bloom and the city literally smells…nice. That's a first. 7:30 p.m. — Shopping in New York means a ton of options, but it also takes a ton of time going between stores. It's honestly made me hate clothes shopping, so I get a Stitch Fix box every six weeks. I opt to keep two items from my latest delivery for $146. $146 9 p.m. — My boyfriend has been working 70 hour weeks lately, and it hasn't been great for our relationship. He leaves work early (by his standards) for us to go on a date tonight. We grab octopus tacos and (a few too many) margaritas. He picks up the tab. Daily Total: $162.80",4,14
"8:30 a.m. — I am feeling those margaritas today. I down some Pedialyte, say a silent prayer of thanks to the creator of dry shampoo, and run out the door. 9:20 a.m. — I think an egg and cheese sandwich is in order with my coffee. Luckily I have a day of email follow-ups with business units, so I'll be able to sit quietly at my desk. $5.50 1 p.m. — Weekend meal planning is always such a delicate balance between wanting to only get takeout because the pantry is empty and not wanting to waste food because of fun, last minute plans. I stop by Trader Joe's during lunch and grab a few items with a longer shelf life, including ingredients for prosciutto pizza, veggie sausages, and cauliflower gnocchi. I charge it to the credit card I use for shared expenses with my boyfriend. $43.85 6:30 p.m. — I smile at a puppy on my way home. The owner catches my smile and goes, “You know, you can pet him.” It's literally the highlight of my week. New York can feel really hard sometimes, so I've learned to appreciate the little things. 8 p.m. — Quiet night in on the couch with my boyfriend. We make a frozen pizza, split a bottle of wine, and catch up on our weeks. Daily Total: $49.35",5,14
"8:30 a.m. — My neighbors are up and loudly tinkering in the backyard, so now I'm up too. I grab toast and get myself together to run errands: drop-offs at the post office, Goodwill, and Rent the Runway. I tried out Rent the Runway Unlimited this month, but I was ordering way more misses than hits. It was a fun experiment, but I couldn't justify the $160 price tag to myself. 10:45 a.m. — Spin class. I bought a bunch of classes on Black Friday last year, and now I'm scrambling to use them before they expire. I grab an iced coffee next door on my way out. $3.45 12:30 p.m. — I love wandering farmer's markets, even if visiting them usually means an impulse purchase or two. I unsuccessfully search for my favorite mushrooms (lion's mane) and buy plants for my backyard. $38 1:30 p.m. — I get home, put together a salad with random things in the fridge, and spend the rest of the day fiddling with my garden. 7:30 p.m. — I'm feeling especially introverted tonight, and encourage my boyfriend to go to his friend's party downtown without me. I have an avocado with rice for dinner and look forward to an evening of guilty pleasures (Halo Top and browsing AskReddit for creepy stories). Daily Total: $41.45",6,14
"11 a.m. — I wake up way late — it seems like when I wind down, it's really hard to get myself going again. I'm not sure if it's my inner introvert, my depression, or general tiredness from the week. I make eggs with mango salsa for breakfast and catch up on over a very late breakfast. 12:20 p.m. — My boyfriend did some spreadsheet budgeting while I was sleeping, and now we have a bit of a surprise serious conversation about marriage and buying a house in the next five years. He's shocked by the cost of weddings, and I'm shocked by his budget for a first home. We both leave the conversation feeling a little overwhelmed. I don't see myself in the New York area long-term, but his industry, where he's totally killing it, is really based here. The tension between those things has been hanging over our relationship for the last two years and has really kept me from wanting to get engaged. 2 p.m. — I had big plans for the day, but I'm still on the couch watching . I give up and own it, as opposed to feeling guilty. 7 p.m. — My low energy has transformed into existential dread for Monday. My boyfriend heats up (another) frozen pizza for us and makes me a martini. He catches up on work while I read on the couch. The Sunday scaries are alive and well and I go to bed before 10. Daily Total: $0",7,14
"5:30 a.m. — I wake up and make coffee at home. I kiss my boyfriend goodbye before heading out the door to walk the dog. I listen to podcasts while I walk ( , then ) for about an hour. The sunrise is lovely. I get home and get ready for work, trying to find something to wear and realizing that I really need to do laundry. I make a smoothie for breakfast and put it in my purse to have when I get to work. 12 p.m. — I should take real lunch breaks more often, but most of the time I just eat at my desk so I can go home a little earlier (even though I rarely actually go home early). I eat a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, a banana, and a granola bar that I brought from home. I like bringing my own lunch because I can save a lot of money and time. I usually make PB&Js for my boyfriend and me the night before and take a few trips to the coffee machine down the hall throughout the day. I spend the day in front of a computer, so frequent breaks are important! I make a lot of progress on my projects today. 7 p.m. — I go home (a little) early from work so I can get ready for a work dinner tonight. My boss is retiring and invited my whole department (and their significant others) to a nice dinner to celebrate. It's at an Italian restaurant and we all get wine and pasta. My boyfriend gets along well with my coworkers and it is so nice to meet everyone's SOs. My boss pays for the whole meal. We go home with full bellies and go straight to bed. Daily Total: $0",1,15
"8 a.m. — I sleep in and cuddle with my dog for a while before I finally made it out of bed. I make coffee and head out for my usually morning dog walk. When I get back, I spend two hours cleaning the whole house (my Saturday ritual). I reward my efforts with breakfast: avocado toast, a hard boiled egg, and a banana. 1 p.m. — I meet two of my coworkers at a local beer garden. I usually only hang out with my boyfriend, so I'm excited to do something social and build my friendships with the people I work with. It's a beautiful day, so we sit outside to drink and eat nachos. I have two beers. We split the bill evenly; my portion comes out to about $30 including a generous tip, since the waiter is very nice and funny. $30 4 p.m. — I stop at the grocery store on my way home for my usual weekly necessities. I get bananas, peanut butter, cottage cheese, and chips (for my lunches this week); chicken breasts, cheese, bread, mushrooms, and tortillas (for dinners this week); and laundry detergent, apple cider vinegar, and trash bags since we ran out recently. I usually spend a long time in the grocery store comparing prices and looking for the best value. $84 6 p.m. — My boyfriend makes us homemade pizza for dinner and I prepare a salad with lettuce from our garden. His pizzas are always delicious, and they're actually pretty inexpensive since he makes the dough and sauce from scratch. He splurged on an outdoor pizza oven a few months ago (he says it was on sale at the hardware store), and it cooks a pizza in about five minutes! Daily Total: $114",2,15
"7 a.m. — I wake up early and decide to take the dog for a hike. I make coffee at home and load up the dog in the car. We drive to the regional park about 15 minutes from the house and hike for an hour and a half. It's sunny and crisp outside, and the dog enjoys the little adventure. When we get home, I make breakfast (Kashi cereal and a banana). 11 a.m. — My boyfriend and I meet up with friends at a local winery. They know someone who works there, so we get free wine tastings and 50% off purchases! The estate is gorgeous, so we walk around for a while before enjoying our wine tasting. I buy two bottles, one sparkling and one red, which comes out to just $30 after the discount. We play bocce ball and end up drinking the bottle of sparkling during our game. $30 2 p.m. — After wine tasting, we're all getting hungry, so we go to a BBQ place nearby. We got burgers and beers and split the bill. My boyfriend pays for our half. Then we spent the next hour talking about the business that we want to start together. My boyfriend and the other guy are both landscapers, so they want to start a landscaping company that they can work on on afternoons and weekends in addition to their day jobs. I would help them set up their website and digital marketing, and our other friend would help with billing and bookkeeping. We have a pretty good idea of what we want to do, but it'll take time to get it off the ground. 7 p.m. — After a pretty heavy (and late) lunch, I'm not hungry for dinner, so we just have snacks and watch TV at home. I get my stuff together for tomorrow (I like to plan my outfits for the next day every night) and make our lunches. We're in bed by 9 p.m. Daily Total: $30",3,15
"6 a.m. — It's pouring rain outside when I wake up on Monday, but I'm pretty committed to my daily dog walks, so we gear up and head out. When we get back a half hour later, both me and the dog are totally soaked and it takes me a while to get us cleaned up and dried off. I get ready for work and pack my yoga clothes for the class I plan to go to after, pack my lunch and head to work. 12 p.m. — It's a pretty mellow day at work and I've been steadily checking things off my to-do list all morning. I eat my lunch and snacks at my desk (PB&J, hard boiled egg, banana) and decide to go for a walk during my lunch break. There's a nice wetlands nature park across from my office, and now that the weather has cleared up, it's beautiful out. I take a trail that I assume will loop around, but I end up having to turn around and hustle back so I'm not gone too long. I check my Health app and see that I already walked three miles today! 5 p.m. — My regular yoga studio is about a half an hour drive away downtown, where parking is kinda tricky. I leave work a little early, change clothes on my way out, and drive to the studio. I park on the street in a metered space, which is $3 for two hours. I'm glad I made time to go to yoga today because I really needed it! I was feeling sore and tight, but the gentle Vinyasa flow did the trick. $3 7 p.m. — After my yoga class, I walk over to Starbucks and get a small black coffee ($1.95). It is WAY too hot, so after scalding my tongue, I douse it with cream and head back to the car. At home, my boyfriend saved me pizza (BBQ chicken this time). I make our lunches for tomorrow and we settle into the couch for and . $1.95 Daily Total: $4.95",4,15
"6 a.m. — We both slept horribly last night because the neighbor's dog was barking outside all night. I sleep in an extra 30 minutes. Then I do my normal morning routine: coffee, dog walk, get ready, make breakfast, head to work. It's sunny this morning, so I take the long way, driving past the pastures of sheep. 12 p.m. — I have a really successful morning of checking things off my to-do list. I prepare for a meeting scheduled with my boss this afternoon. I've only been in this position for a few months, so I'm trying really hard to make a good impression and go above and beyond (because I hope to get a raise at the end of the year!). I eat my lunch at my desk (PB&J, chips, hard boiled egg) but then my boyfriend calls me to ask if I want to meet up for lunch. He drives around all over the county for his job as a landscape project manager, so he happened to be at a project near my office. Since I've already eaten, we decide to meet for a walk in the nature park. It's a nice little break in the middle of the day and I get in some fresh air and kisses. 6 p.m. — The meeting with my boss goes great; I don't know why I was stressed about it! He's very approachable, and these meetings are really just to give us the opportunity to check in about my projects and ask any questions. I'm really liking this company and the people I work with. I feel valued and appreciated, and I think the work I'm doing is making a difference! I come home and make myself a nice cocktail while my boo makes dinner (more pizza). He brings in salad greens from the garden, which I toss with Caesar dressing and homemade croutons. We tend to eat the same thing all week because it makes grocery shopping and cooking quicker and easier. This week is obviously pizza week, but we mix it up often. 8 p.m. — We go over our finances again to make sure everything is even. Since the rent, water, electric/gas, and garbage ($3,027) come out of my account and he deals with the Internet, car lease, and car insurance ($435), he gives me a check for $1,300 each month. I take care of most of the groceries so he can focus on paying off his debt. I'm also trying to save up to buy my car once the lease is up. I have $9,000 now, but in a year, I need to have at least $15,000 so I can buy the car outright and avoid financing it. I'm thinking about investing in mutual funds, but the process seems complicated and I'm not sure if now is the right time with the market going up and down. We're both doing pretty well, but he needs to pay off his debt. We both want to save up to buy a house. Daily Total: $0",5,15
"6 a.m. — Neither of us wanted to get out of bed this morning. I snooze the alarm a couple times and we have sexy time instead ;). I take the dog for a longer walk than normal and jump in the shower when I get home. I decide to wear my ""power pants"" today because I'm just feeling good. I make a smoothie, pack my lunch, and head to work. 10 a.m. — I have a meeting with my team to go over our projects. My boss gave me a few new projects to handle this week and gives us updates on the progress of the showroom we're redesigning for an upcoming trade show. There will be a lot of work coming down the line soon, but there's nothing we can start on yet. This is the calm before the storm. 11 a.m. — I signed up for a brown bag Lunch and Learn last week as part of our wellness program that focuses on ""handling difficult situations,"" so I head down to the conference room. The presentation was good and we learn about how to minimize conflict in the workplace. The main take-away was that we can only control our reactions and we shouldn't take the behavior of others personally. Overall, it was helpful and gave me good interpersonal tools. I snack on Sun Chips that they provide. 12 p.m. — I take a little break, walk down to the nature park, and sit on a bench in the shade to read my book. I'm on the third book of the Millennium series, . 12:30 p.m. — I head back to my desk and eat my lunch — PB&J, banana, and cottage cheese. I spend the rest of the afternoon checking things off my to-do list, but I don't get as much done as I had hoped. I stay a little late, and head home at 5:45 p.m. 6 p.m. — My new Girlfriend Collective leggings have arrived! I got a free pair a couple years ago as part of a promotion, and they're the only ones I wear now, so I decided to buy a second pair. They fit great and the packaging is beautiful. My boyfriend and I drink cocktails and eat salad and homemade pizza. We spend the evening watching and , and then go to bed at 10 p.m. Daily Total: $0",6,15
"6 a.m. — It's really hard to wake up this morning. The house is chilly, which makes getting out from under the covers difficult. I finally get out of bed, make my coffee, and walk the dog. I do squats and push-ups on a park bench, and then get ready and kiss my man goodbye when he leaves. I make a smoothie and head to work. 12 p.m. — My boss's boss is retiring, and today is her surprise retirement party with the whole company. I help decorate with balloons and hang a piñata. She is so surprised and she tears up when she walks into the room. We eat cake and Mexican food and hang out for a couple hours. The afternoon is slow and I don't feel like working much today, especially after eating a bunch of cake. 5 p.m. — I get home and the house smells delicious. My man is cooking homemade (from scratch!) potatos au gratin. So. Much. Yes. We take the dog to the park across the street to play ball. He doesn't always listen but he loves fetch, so we compromise by playing fetch with a 50 foot leash on. He gets tired out pretty quickly. We eat our delicious dinner (potatoes, BBQ chicken, and salad from the garden) and settle in for TV time. I fall asleep on the couch and my boyfriend carries me to bed. Daily Total: $0",7,15
"4:50 a.m. — I get up and change into my running clothes. It's Friday! I run intervals for two and a half miles and head back to shower, change, and make coffee. I usually eat breakfast at home, but I need to get into work early today, so I pack an apple and peanut butter. 6:30 a.m. — I get to work around 6:30, and then finish up paperwork and documentation. I try and remember not to make phone calls before 9 as a courtesy to others who don't get to work as early as I do, so I make a list of people I need to call in a few hours. My coworker gets into work at 9 and we head out to get potting soil for flower boxes we made for the community garden I manage. We end up getting soil from her friend who lives on a farm, so we ""tour"" the property on a four-wheeler. 12:45 p.m. — Finally finish work in the garden, and I heat up leftovers for lunch. I had pheasant for the first time last night and it was surprisingly good (tastes like chicken, lol), so I eat that with root vegetables, potatoes, parsnips, and brown rice for lunch. Then I have a La Croix while continuing work. 3:45 p.m. — I leave work a little before 4 to head to the movie theater! I'm takin' myself out to see . I'm a member of the theater, which means sometimes free treats but always half-priced tickets. It's not really close to work or to my house, but when you live in the middle of nowhere, nothing is close by. I buy the ticket ($5) and get a sparkling water ($2). $7 7 p.m. — The movie was AMAZING. I was laughing, I was crying — I felt all the emotions. Ruth Bader Ginsburg is such an incredible woman and she is so hilarious. The scenes with Obama made my heart hurt. I leave the theater and stop to get gas on my way home. $26.65 8:30 p.m. — I'm in bed at 8:30 and asleep within 10 minutes. Daily Total: $33.65",1,16
"5:30 a.m. — My attempt to sleep in fails. While I'm awake, I might as well go for a run. 6:40 a.m. — After my run, I do some foam rolling. While rollin' and stretchin', my roommates dog attacks me with kisses. We go outside and play with a ball for 30 minutes. I probably find the game just as entertaining as she does (haha). 7:30 a.m. — For breakfast, I make leftover rice with a fried egg and sesame seaweed. Then I clean up the kitchen. I feel like I'm on a roll, so I load up my car with recycling and trash. The downside to living in the country is that you have to take your garbage to the transfer station. I attempt to mow the lawn while outside, but the cord won't pull. I'm worried I may have broken it, so I'm going to let my roommate figure this one out! 9 a.m. — I shower and lay in my robe on my bed until I'm completely dry. I find this to be such a  luxury. I love lounging in my robe. I scoot out of the house and hit up the transfer station. Luckily we (a.k.a. mostly my roommate) sorted the recycling, so it doesn't take long to do. 9:30 a.m. — I run over to the community garden to water it before the sun is up. Otherwise, the water will evaporate or the sun will burn the plants if they're wet. While I'm there, I run into a member I haven't met yet and tell him the dates of the community potlucks I planned. 10:20 a.m. — I head into the larger town and make my way to Target. I like to buy paper products here because they come in a larger size than the stores near my house have. I pick up toilet paper, paper towels, cotton pads, and face towels. $46.80 10:45 a.m. — Head to TJ Maxx because someone mentioned they might have running shorts, which I have been on the hunt for. All the options are a little too flashy for me, so I leave empty-handed. 11:30 a.m. — I hit up the natural food store to get items that the co-op I belong to doesn't sell. I get bulk polenta, quinoa, salt toothpaste, two kinds of sesame seaweed mix (really trying to find which one is my favorite) and a bag of Barbara's Kitchen cheese puffs (jalapeño flavor, the only flavor worth eating). $44.34 12:45 p.m. — I head to a food pantry to meet with the director. On the way, I snack on cheese puffs. I run a program that brings fresh, local produce to food pantries and other sites around the county, so the food is accessible to low-income families and individuals. 1:45 p.m. — I finally make it home and let my roommate's dog out. I put up the goods from my shopping when I hear the dog barking outside. She has free range of the whole property and there is a lot of wildlife, so I'm always worried for her safety. I go out and yell at her to leave it, whatever it may be this time, and she won't. I get closer and realize a woodchuck is right in front of her, and they're barking and hissing at each other. I break them up and get the dog back inside. I give her a treat, then start a load of laundry​. 3:45 p.m. — I hang my laundry on the line outside because it's beautiful out. I throw beans onto the stove and prep dinner because I haven't eaten a proper lunch. I'm making my favorite white bean and red quinoa burgers from Half Baked Harvest. I've made them so many times I don't even look at the recipe anymore. I also slice up sweet potatoes to make oven baked fries. While things are cooking, I play with the dog more because she was inside a lot today. 5 p.m. — I practice piano while I bake the fries and when the timer goes off, I sit down to eat and listen to NPR on the kitchen radio. When my roommate gets home, I make her a plate and we catch up on our days and the movie last night, since she was already in bed when I got home. 8 p.m. — We're both exhausted (my roommate is a farmer), and we both go upstairs and get ready for bed. I recently got Netflix again, so I catch up on . Daily Total: $91.14",2,16
"7:16 a.m. — I'm up and only have 10 minutes before I need to leave the house to meet up with my running club. I splash water on my face, brush my teeth, and throw on my baseball hat and Garmin watch. 8 a.m. — Make it to running club on time. I originally joined this club when I first moved to the area to meet people, but this is rural America, so the club is mostly older retired women. I love it just the same, but the social aspect isn't what I was going for. We run three miles and stretch before parting ways. 9:30 a.m. — I come home hungry, and luckily my roommate has coffee made. She's outside cleaning up the chicken coop, so I start breakfast for the both of us. I make leftover sweet potatoes with fried eggs and toast. The coffee she made is so tasty that I ask her to make more. (Apparently, she puts a lil honey and milk in it.) We talk about the progress with the coop and what I can do to help. We just got chicks from an elementary school that hatched them as a project. They're currently in the guest bedroom in a huge pin under heat lamps until they get big enough to live outside. 10:45 a.m. — I shower off really quickly and throw clothes on so we can head to the farmer's market. Despite my roommate working the farmer's market yesterday, she didn't get a chance to shop around. We get eggs, breakfast sausages, radishes, and asparagus. She pays because I don't have cash. She asks if I want to stop in at the brewery where the market is being held. We hang out with our favorite bartender. She gets an IPA and I get water. 11:45 a.m. — I need more soap, so we walk across to the co-op. We're non-working co-op members, so we get a 2% discount. $7.16 12:20 p.m. — We stop by the auto shop to get the parts to fix the lawn mower. I swear my roommate can fix anything! Roommate pays for whatever it is that we needed. 1:15 p.m. — Get home and put the groceries away. My roommate brought home a pork butt from the market yesterday, so I begin to prep the pork for pulled pork tacos. I brown it on all sides and then remove it and add onion and garlic. I rub the pork with seasoning before putting it back in the Dutch oven, cover it with a bottle of wine, and throw in the oven for four hours. After cleaning up the kitchen​, I vacuum the house and get distracted by Netflix. 2:30 p.m. — Vacuuming takes a long time with such a large house, and I feel accomplished when I'm finished. I even move my bed to vacuum all the dust bunnies in my bedroom. I practice piano before I watch another episode of . 4:30 p.m. — I make a salad to go with the tacos. I pull the pork out and throw in some of the beans I have leftover from yesterday. Then, I call my roommate inside and we eat dinner together. She heads back out to work on things in the barn afterwards, and I clean up the kitchen. 7 p.m. — It's early but I'm tired, so I get ready for bed and lay down to read my book, . I just got it from the library because I loooooved by Ruth Ozeki and I'm hoping her other books are just as great. I fall asleep before 9. Daily Total: $7.16",3,16
"6:45 a.m. — I wake up naturally and get moving. Today is a holiday, so I don't have work! It's my first day of crew though. I used to cox in high school, and one of the farmers I work with in the area told me that he belongs to a club team and that they're always looking for coxswains, so I said I'd try it out. I'll be paid $10 per hour, which is crazy to me, but I welcome it! 8:45 a.m. — Get to the boathouse and meet the coaches and team. Everyone seems nice and welcoming. They're really appreciative of me joining. I don't go out on the water, but do get to help the novice rowers. 11:30 a.m. — I stop over at the community garden to water and weed. I run into another member I haven't met yet and introduce myself. It's hard to meet the gardeners when everyone has different schedules, which is why I plan community potlucks. 12:30 p.m. — I get home and heat up a leftover veggie burger with yogurt on the side. 1:30 p.m. — I attempt to mow the lawn again now that the mower is fixed, and three miles and an hour and a half later, the yard looks amazing! Such a societal pressure to have a manicured lawn, but I love it. Luckily I'm not paid to do this, because from the upstairs window you can see  weird lines in the area I mowed. I broom the walkways and clean up the edges. 3 p.m. — I'm pretty pooped, so I have a La Croix while sitting on the rocking chair on the back porch. I catch up on the phone with two friends, which feels good. It's nice living in the country, but I do miss being in a city near friends and having a younger group of people to hang out with. 4 p.m. — I shower off and then start dinner. I'm heating up leftover pork for burritos. I roast sweet potatoes (I eat so many of them, they're my favorite vegetable) and make a quick salad. 5 p.m. — My roommate and I eat dinner together. I really value our relationship. She's quite a bit older than me, but has known me since I was 18. We talk about how I'm anxious about my busy schedule, how I feel like I should be doing more career-wise, and how I want to go to grad school but am scared about debt. I list all the different things that I'm anxious about and she patiently talks me through them. 6 p.m. — I get letters together to send in the morning. I write a lot of letters each week to various friends across the country. It's mainly for my own sake, because I value writing things down. I don't get many letters in return, but I couldn't care less. I practice piano. I haven't really gotten better at the piece I was supposed to practice before this week's lesson. 8 p.m. — In bed and asleep by 8:30. Daily Total: $0",4,16
"5:20 a.m. — Wake up and my legs are sore. I foam roll and stretch before getting dressed. I make coffee while my roommate eats breakfast. I make Bob's Red Mill gluten-free eight-grain hot cereal. It's delicious and only takes about five minutes to make. I fry an egg and put sesame and seaweed on the hot cereal with the egg on top. Clean up and pack my lunch. 7 a.m. — At work and catching up on emails. I spend a good chunk of time creating the Powerpoint for a training I'm hosting in two weeks. I love creating graphics for things like this, so I probably take longer than I should to create it. I outline how I want the training to go and write up a sketch of what I'll say for each section. It's all about safe produce handling, which I'm going to make as fun as possible. I'm planning the food that I'll bring in to highlight what we're harvesting now and distributing through our food pantries. 9 a.m. — I catch up with my coworkers about their holiday weekends when they get in. 12 p.m. — I run to the chain grocery store to buy more olive oil, which is much cheaper than at the co-op. I also grab Kind Bars for snacks on those early mornings, a box of La Croix to keep at work, and an Amy's burrito, which I have for lunch. $35.40 3 p.m. — I spend time weeding and straightening things up in the garden. I meet a member who wasn't able to come the first two weeks that the garden was open. She's a single working mother with quite a few kids, so I go ahead and weed her plot and add compost so it's ready for her. She's really sweet about it. She works at the one restaurant in town, and I'm going to make a point to visit it sometime soon. 4:30 p.m. — Home from work and my roommate has brought home lots of veggies home. I prep them and throw sweet potatoes in the oven. While I wait for them to cook, I practice piano. I throw brown rice, pulled pork, bok choy and a lot of garlic together. My roommate comes in and we eat it with the potatoes and a side salad. 5:30 p.m. — I call a friend and we catch up for an hour. It's been two months since we last talked on the phone, so it's great to hear her voice. I take a lot of weekend trips and we plan to meet in NYC this summer. We met up there last fall and it was wonderful, so we'll do it again but in a different neighborhood this time. We stayed in Boerum Hill, which is my kind of pace but she wants to stay somewhere more lively. 7 p.m. — A different friend mentions that she's in the midst of breaking up with her boyfriend. Even though it's her decision, I know that it's going to be really hard for her. I begin to craft a lil gift to send her. I'm making 14 different notes that each have a different thing in them, like a command to go on a walk and call a friend (a.k.a. me!) or a note with a list of all her best qualities. She can open one when she feels like it. It takes a long time, and I only create four of the 14 tonight. 8:30 p.m. — I can't write or draw anymore, so I watch and fall asleep by 9.

"4:13 a.m. — First real morning practice for crew. I make coffee, pack breakfast, lunch, and water. 5:45 a.m. — I get to the boathouse and we watch a safety video. It's hilarious — I don't know how they staged these extreme misfortunes, but they did a great job because it's hard to eject yourself from a boat! The coach asks me to take a boat in the water and, of course, I say yes. I'm really nervous — it's been nine years since I've been on the water and I kinda forgot all the commands, so I wing it. We get in the water and the boat is floating all over the place. I've forgotten how to steer. It's a complete mess and some of the members are getting annoyed. I try my best to stay positive and light-hearted about it, but I'm also frustrated. Docking is my literal nightmare, but we make it back without running into anything. I breathe a sigh of relief. 8 a.m. — I get into work and change into my work clothes. I don't dress too nicely at work because I'm usually working in a garden or farm, or moving boxes to and from places, so it's just jeans and a tank top. I eat my breakfast of yogurt with peanut butter and jelly in it. Sounds weird, but I love peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, so I try to make variations of them with other things (yogurt, oatmeal, and cookies). 9:30 a.m. — I remember to take the work van into the mechanic. I drive it over and let him know it's outside. I walk back to work and call my mom on the way. I walk through a neighborhood and pass a dog in the street, and then notice that there's a person hanging out in his car in his driveway, where I'm assuming this dog lives. When I walk past, the guy yells expletives at his dog. He then notices me and yells at me, asking me if I want to go on a date and get a drink. I can't believe it — it is 9:30 in the morning! I am so annoyed. I hate men. I tell my mom what happened, and we laugh about it. You can't catcall me in the morning! 10:30 a.m. — I run over to the food pantry to see the produce situation we have this week. It looks great, as we've been getting a lot of produce lately, which is nice, especially because there were weeks during the winter when it was bleak. I also pop in the garden to weed some more. I feel like I have to set a good example as the manager of the garden, so I also pull weeds in other people's plots so that they don't outgrow the actual plants. 12 p.m. — I heat up leftovers for lunch: pulled pork, rice, and bok choy. I quickly eat so I can go on a walk. I call my friend during his lunch break to catch up. I'm from a city and left over a year ago, and now am wondering if I made a horrible mistake by moving to the country. Despite loving the things I do, I really miss my friends. This friend and I used to hang out two to three times a week and lived within walking distance of one another, so I appreciate the times we get to talk. 4 p.m. — I change into my running clothes and head to my piano teacher's house. My teacher is a 78-year-old great grandmother who has played the piano since 1947. She is a sassy gal and I really love taking lessons from her. I only started piano in February. I had always wanted to play as a kid but never did, so when I saw her ad at the hardware store, I called and the rest is history! I have my first recital in two weeks, so I practice my solo piece and then we practice our duet. I asked her if I would be her oldest student at the recital and she said, yes, but it's fine because I look like a teenager. HA, can't wait for that! 4:30 p.m. — I stop and get gas. $35.80 5:45 p.m. — Get to running club, despite feeling a little tired, and decide I better just go. I'm glad I did, because my favorite member is there. We usually run together and I pace, but tonight that gal is on another level. I desperately try and keep up with her, and I finally catch up when we hit a hill. We do a cool down walk together, and then I head home. 7:20 p.m. — I get home and am very tired. My roommate has been rebuilding the chicken coop all night, so dinner is up to me. We have the last of the veggies burgers and broccoli. I save the rest for lunch tomorrow. 8:30 p.m. — I foam roll and stretch more before getting in the shower. I lotion up and am in bed and asleep by 9. Daily Total: $35.80",6,16
"5:13 a.m. — I'm up, but I check my phone and scroll through Instagram and my email. I try not to do this, but this morning I don't care. My hair is a mess from sleeping on it wet, so I have to work magic and use bobby pins to get it together. 6:30 a.m. — I make toast, breakfast sausage, and an egg for breakfast. I eat with my roommate and we talk about the fish we ordered from the co-op that will be ready this afternoon. I'm so excited — I love the fresh fish that they get! 7 a.m. — Get into work and read through my email newsletters. I get so many great ones from : Daily Briefing, which discusses the news; Smarter Living, which talks about habits, health, practical purchases; Cooking, which I use to look up a recipe for the fish; and Gender Letter, which talks about women, pop culture, and gender. I take my time to go through them. 9 a.m. — I have to get a produce order out to a partner, so I walk over to the pantry and get a good variety of produce together for them. I walk back to the office, stopping by the garden. It looks great, so I just keep walking. 12 p.m. — The day is flying by. I've been meeting with my boss to discuss logistics and the schedule for summer harvesting and distributing. I stop to eat my lunch of leftovers. I'm craving chocolate, but I don't have any at the office. I kinda also want a cookie. I hold out knowing that we have biscotti at home. 4 p.m. — I leave work. I'm lucky to have flexible hours, so if I go in at 7, I can leave at 4 p.m. I'm obviously a morning person, so it works for me. 4:30 p.m. — I practice piano and think about what to make for dinner. We have done so well at eating all the food in the fridge that it's getting slim. I'm not too terribly hungry, but I still want that biscotti, so I have a piece. I make a salad with radishes and a simple dressing. We heat up more pulled pork and have burritos. This pork is so good, especially when you re-heat it and it gets crispy. 5:30 p.m. — While cleaning up from dinner, my roommate and I realize that we didn't pick up the fish. I'll do it after work tomorrow because I'm too tired to go back out. 7 p.m. — I clean up and get ready for bed early so I can lounge before going to. sleep. It's an early morning tomorrow again, so I watch and fall asleep by 9. Daily Total: $0",7,16
"8 a.m. — My boyfriend and I sleep in. He's been feeling quite down for the last couple of months and has recently realized it's likely a relapse of his depression, which he hasn't suffered from for the past few years. We have a chat and a cuddle in bed before making lattes, scrambled eggs, and bacon for brekkie. He decides to take a mental health day off from work and makes a doctor's appointment for tomorrow. I do PhD work from home as per usual. Boyfriend takes our dog for a nice long walk while I write. 11 a.m. — I come across super cheap flights to Auckland (where my boyfriend's family lives), and we decide to book a short four-night trip. Boyfriend pays for the flights ($471.07 for the two of us), and I use my credit card travel points to book us a luxurious first night in a five-star hotel ($304.73). We're thinking of renting an Airbnb on beautiful Waiheke Island for the remaining three nights and inviting his family to come and stay there with us. Boyfriend got a new credit card last week and is trying to get to his sign-on amount ASAP to get his bonus points, so he is paying for more things than usual at the moment. (We're aiming to have enough points between us to take a round-the-world trip in business class in the next two years.) I will reimburse him for half of the holiday when his credit card payment is due. $304.73 2 p.m. — We decide to take a break and get a coffee and hot chips to share for lunch from the café across the road. I order a ""daytime"" (non-alcoholic) special beverage with cold drip coffee, rosewater, and almond milk, but the waitress talks me into having the proper version which includes Frangelico — great start to a Monday. (It's delicious, though.) Boyfriend pays the $23. 4 p.m. — My desk at home is a bit high, and when I have my chair at the correct height, my feet don't touch the floor (short girl problems). I decide enough is enough and order an adjustable foot rest from Officeworks ($34.22). I need to spend a little bit more to get free next-day delivery, so I add in a mousepad for my boyfriend. $54.76 7 p.m. — My mum gets home from work, and we make dinner together. It's one of the last days of warm weather (we are truly entering autumn now!), so we have BBQ sausages, green salad, and potato salad. We share the cooking and cleaning in our house. My partner and I are responsible for the menu planning and writing the shopping list, and my mum does the bulk of the grocery shopping, with us picking up any extra little things that we require throughout the week. Our main groceries are included in the rent that we pay to my mum each week. After dinner, we all hang out and watch , followed by (although boyfriend heads off to play computer games during the movie!). Then we head to bed around 11:30. Daily Total: $359.49",1,17
"9 a.m. — We sleep in late again (dangers of working from home) and eventually get out of bed. I make breakfast while my boyfriend starts work (remotely from home). He's usually on breakfast duty, but today I make our coffees and yogurt with granola and raspberries. I'm working from home again today, so I hit the computer after breakfast. 1 p.m. — My sister bought me a voucher for a facial from a place nearby, and my appointment is this afternoon. Traffic (as usual) is a nightmare in Melbourne, and it takes me nearly 40 minutes by the time I drive there, find a parking spot, and walk to the salon. It's gorgeous, and I have an amazing hour-long facial. After the treatment, I buy a new cleanser which is supposed to be a bit gentler than what I'm currently using and a facial oil which is supposed to replace moisturizer. $108 3 p.m. — Boyfriend went to the doctor while I had my facial, so he tells me about it when I get home. It seems like a weight has been lifted from his shoulders, so I'm feeling relieved that he's on the path to getting better. We eat leftover BBQ for lunch, and I have a quick play with the dog before getting back to my work. 7 p.m. — Boyfriend is working until 6:30 tonight, so my mum and I make a Mexican-inspired BBQ corn and chorizo salad for dinner. It's delicious, and one of our favorites. Usually we make enough to have leftovers for lunch the next day, but decide not to tonight, as we will be out all day tomorrow, and I can't stand food wastage. We watch again after dinner — is it just me or does it get really boring towards the end of the series...? Daily Total: $108",2,17
"8 a.m. — It's a public holiday in Australia, and we have plans with a couple of friends to spend the day at a wine region (Yarra Valley), approximately one hour from Melbourne by car. We're looking forward to catching up with these friends, as many of our friends are either married with children or single AF, so it's nice to spend time with another couple for a change. We're picking them up (I get really carsick as a passenger, so have volunteered to be designated driver for the day) in a couple of hours, so I make scrambled eggs and flat whites at home to fill us up before we leave. 11 a.m. — We make our first stop at Chandon for sparkling wines. We each do a tasting ($4.54 per person) of five wines, and we find a few winners. Our friends pay. As usual, my boyfriend loves the sparkling shiraz, and I like the sparking rosé. We buy a bottle of each, and my boyfriend pays. From there, we head to a gin distillery called Four Pillars Gin, which I've been wanting to visit for a long time. Upon entering, we're told that the tasting is two and a half standard drinks each, so I sit out for this one, since I'm driving. I still have a couple tiny sips of a few that I haven't tried before: Spiced Negroni gin, Modern Australian gin, Chardonnay barrel gin, and Sherry cask gin...YUM. 1 p.m. — We're feeling a bit hungry (and the others are getting a little tipsy), so we decide to head to lunch at Innocent Bystander. It's super busy today, and it seems like all of Melbourne had the same idea, so we have to wait a couple of hours for a table. We do a complimentary tasting of their range while we wait. Eventually, our table is ready and we order truffle and pecorino fries, broccoli salad, and three pizzas to share. The others each get a glass of wine but I get a lemon mineral water. We split the bill with our friends, and I pay for my boyfriend and myself. $51.50 3 p.m. — After lunch we head to another vineyard (Yering Station) and try more wines. Our friends are going through a Chardonnay phase, so they try those while my boyfriend focuses on reds and I try a bit of a range. We buy a bottle of red and a dessert wine (so delicious) to take home (boyfriend pays), and our friends find a Chardonnay that they like. We head to Yarra Valley Dairy to sit down and have a cheese platter, but unfortunately there are no tables left, so instead we do a complimentary tasting, and I buy two different types of marinated goat's feta (one in saffron, garlic, and herbs, and one in chili oil) and a cow's cheese spread with dill to put on bagels for breakfast. They also have a really cute reusable bag, so I buy one to put the cheese in for the trip home. $30.30 6 p.m. — Finally get home after dropping our friends off! My mum and I make a big batch of veggie-heavy fried rice with bacon and egg, and I make extra to take to my friend's place when I visit her tomorrow. She had twins a few months ago and also has a two-year-old, so I try to always come with some meals for them, as she definitely has her hands full! After dinner, we veg out in front of the TV for a couple of hours before heading to bed. Daily Total: $81.80",3,17
"6 a.m. — Early start today, as I have an operating shift on the other side of the city. My boyfriend makes us breakfast of flat whites and sliced tomatoes on toast while I get ready (love him!). In return, I drop him at work on my way. 11 a.m. — My operating shift finishes early today, so the primary surgeon and I decide to go for a walk together, as neither of us is hungry for lunch yet. I stop by my house to pick up my dog so she can come for a walk with us (two birds, one stone). I pay for parking next to the park, and we go for a nice walk in the sun. My surgical work is incredibly light this week because of the public holiday. $1.01 12 p.m. — Text the boyfriend to see if he's free for lunch, as the park is a block away from his work. We head to a place we love that makes delicious hot chicken sandwiches (Southern USA-style) and serves natural wines. Trying to be alcohol-free today, so I get a soft drink instead to go with lunch. Boyfriend pays. 3 p.m. — Head over to visit my friend and her babies, bringing the fried rice and a birthday present for her two-year-old (a soft toy unicorn from Cuddle + Kind bought a few weeks ago). It's nice to see her, and we hang out and have a cup of tea for an hour or so while I get lots of baby cuddles. They are super cute, and her two-year-old loves her toy. My friend mentions that she has been feeling a bit left out of friend excursions lately, and I ask her to come with me to the ballet in six weeks, since I have an extra ticket. I have a season pass to the Australian Ballet (bought in December of last year), which is incredibly expensive, but I absolutely love going. 5 p.m. — Make plans with a couple of my friends to see tomorrow night after work, and I buy my ticket online. No one can be bothered cooking tonight, so we decide to order in Indian food from this amazing place that has really authentic, super spicy food. We order from Uber Eats (and Mum pays): samosas, pav bhaji, chicken tikka masala, aloo baingan, butter chicken, garlic naan bread, and rice. The Uber Eats guy tells us this is his fave place when he drops the food off! $16.61 Daily Total: $17.62",4,17
"9 a.m. — I'm meeting a friend and her daughter for brekkie this morning, so I drop the boyfriend off at work on the way and park my car outside the café using the PayStay app to pay. I get cilbir eggs, green juice, and coffee and we catch up on each other's lives while my dog and my friend's daughter play. It's my friend's turn to pay for lunch, so she gets the bill. I'll get it next time. Unfortunately, I forget to cancel my parking when I leave, so I end up paying for the full two hours instead of the one! $6.06 12 p.m. — I head into the city to go to the gym. My gym is located in my favorite shopping center, and I decide to have a look at the shops before heading up. I have a dinner tomorrow night that I'm a bit nervous about — it's a dinner with my boss's friends (some who I have met and worked with before), but everyone there will be five-to-10 years older than me and professionally a few steps above me, so I feel a little bit out of place. I try on a few dresses at Zimmermann, but none of them are quite right for the occasion. Then I find an amazing mohair coat at Scanlan Theodore, which I fall in love with and purchase ($492.70). After the gym (cardio and a meditation class), I go to another store and purchase a pink knit dress, plus a merino knit jumper for my boyfriend because there's a promotion where I get $75.80 off if I spend at least $227. $666.40 2 p.m. — Eat leftovers for lunch at home and settle back into work for a few hours. 5 p.m. — A couple of my friends come over after work. I make us all negronis (my favorite cocktail, so I always have all the ingredients on hand!) and then we head to the cinema. We get a large popcorn to share and a bottle of water each. My friend pays, and we split it three ways. After the film, we decide to get burgers and potato gems. We walk back to my place afterwards, as one of my friends parked her car there earlier. Shower and bed! $34.11 Daily Total: $706.57",5,17
"9 a.m. — Boyfriend and I both wake up craving baked goods and coffee, so we stop by a bakery near us and pick up savory cheese and bacon rolls (he pays), which we eat at home with home-made flat whites. We spend the morning hanging out and watching a couple of episodes of on Netflix. 2 p.m. — Boyfriend heads out to spend the afternoon/night with his mates, and I heat up leftovers at home for lunch. I mope around a little in the afternoon, and my mum and I watch a couple of episodes of . I start getting ready for my boss's dinner — earlier than I usually would, because I'm nervous! I decide to wear the new Stila eyeshadow gel that I bought a couple of weeks ago, because GLITTER! 7:30 p.m. — Get to the dinner and actually have a pretty good time. Because there are so many of us, the restaurant dictates that we have either five or seven courses of the chef's choice. We go for the five courses. I also have two cocktails. We split the bill evenly ($79.60 each) and I leave an extra little tip ($7.59). Tipping isn't necessary in Australia, as everyone earns a fair wage, but I used to work in hospitality and I know how difficult it is! We head to a speakeasy-style bar after dinner, and I have two more cocktails. I contribute $37.90 to the bill for my drinks at the end. $125.09 2 a.m. — It's late when I leave and I don't want to have to wait up to 20 minutes for the tram, so I take an Uber. So much better to be home within five minutes at this hour of the night! Wake up my boyfriend when I climb into bed and get him to warm me up (sorry not sorry!). $7.51 Daily Total: $132.60",6,17
"8 a.m. — Nothing gets you out of bed faster than the sound of your dog about to vomit on your sheets. We managed to get her out in time but not the best start to the morning! Luckily, my mum went to the market in the morning and there are fresh bagels for breakfast! We have them with the cheese spread that I bought at the dairy store in the Yarra Valley, and they're delicious. 10 a.m. — When I was getting ready last night, I used up the last of my favorite liquid eyeliner pen, so I replace it via the online store and also order a new eyeshadow brush. (I'm new to using eyeshadow so I'm slowly building up my brush collection.) $62.92 11 a.m. — My boyfriend is obsessed with boardgames, and I agree to play some with him today. We play Terraforming Mars with his new expansion board, followed by Great Western Trail. I win both games (whoop whoop), which doesn't often happen! For dinner, we make slow-cooked beef, red wine ragu, and fresh fettuccini. I pack in a lot of veggies and let the slow cooker do it's thing. YUM. 8 p.m. — We eat the pasta (which is delicious) for dinner and watch the first part of the season finale of (which ends tomorrow night!). We hang out for a bit and then start getting ready for bed around 10:30 p.m. Daily Total: $62.92",7,17
"10 a.m. — One of my favorite things about the weekend is being able to sleep in! I spend some time in bed browsing social media and news, in that order. A quiet Sunday morning is the height of luxury. 11 a.m. — Where did the time go? I drag myself out of bed and do my morning routine — oil cleanser followed by spritzes of serum and dabs of moisturizer. Skincare is practically cultish in Singapore. I'm running low on moisturizer and make a note to pick up more the next time I'm at the airport (yay duty free). Throw in a load of laundry to feel productive. 12 p.m. — My roommate decides to pick up food from a mall nearby. I go with her and spy an Adidas sports bra for 30% off ($40). Also stop at a supermarket to get groceries, but realize I have a pretty social week ahead, so I settle for some salad and roast chicken ($7.36). $47.36 3 p.m. — It's rainy outside — the perfect day to stay in, read, and nap. I finish the book we're reading in my book club and reward myself by starting a paranormal romance novel. My best friend lent me one a while back and now I'm hooked. #GuiltyPleasures. All my books are on my iPad, courtesy of my library's ebook app! 6 p.m. — Take a bus into town to meet some friends. We're going to try a new virtual reality escape room! It's their opening month, and games are 20% off. I pay for everyone to get the credit card points, and my friends PayNow me back. (It's like Venmo.) $46.68 7:30 p.m. — Update. We did not make it past the zombies. Boo. 8:30 p.m. — We head to a hotpot place for dinner, and after an hour-long wait, we're finally seated. I love this place for their amazing pork belly and fried beancurd rolls. The tomato soup is also one of the most delicious things in the world. We split the bill at the end. I promptly bus home, shower, and crash around midnight. $50.87 Daily Total: $144.91",1,18
"7:30 a.m. — Wake up, get ready, and stumble onto the bus. Mornings are not my thing — I'm never functional until I get some food in me. There's a café at work, and I head directly there. I make myself avocado toast with a fried egg before heading to my desk to check emails. 10:30 a.m. — So. Many. Emails. I decide that I need some caffeine and pop into the office pantry to get a Coke Zero. 12:45 p.m. — Head up to lunch with my team! Honestly, not having to worry about meals is one of the best things about my workplace. Today they're serving local fare — babi ponteh, which is a pork stew over rice. I also grab a fried sesame ball and some steamed shrimp dumplings. 6 p.m. — Back to back meetings all afternoon, so I only get back to doing work at around 5 p.m. I make a heroic effort to focus and get stuff done because I want to leave early for a concert tonight! I booked the tickets months ago. (They were about $120.) 7 p.m. — Still working. Why'd I think I was going to be able to leave on time for a Monday concert? 8:30 p.m. — Finally finished! Luckily the venue is pretty close to the office — only two or three stops on the train! Grab some sushi before the concert with a friend and we split the bill. $18.70 11 p.m. — Worth it. I wish all Monday nights were this great. Take the train home, shower, catch up on social media, and roll into bed. I have an early start tomorrow! Daily Total: $18.70",2,18
"5:30 a.m. — It's still dark outside. I've got a day trip to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, for some client meetings. Brush, shower, change, go. I call a Grab (the regional version of Uber) to the airport ($14). My driver is lovely and plays classical music all the way to the airport, where my gem of a coworker has gotten me a chocolate chip muffin to stave off hangry morning me. ($14 expensed) 9 a.m. — Landed in KL! One hour to roll through immigration and to the client's site. My teammate pays for the Grab. 11:30 a.m. — That went well. Head over to my company's KL office to work and charge our devices — it's pretty far away from the client, and so we have to take a Grab and then a train into town. We get to the office just in time for lunch — we are super hungry and take two helpings of butter chicken each. Then it's time for emails and work until our flight home. ($42 expensed) 4:30 p.m. — We get to the airport a little earlier than expected, so I have time to check out the duty free store. The moisturizer I want is less expensive than it is at the Singapore airport, and I'm a big fan of stocking up on products, so I get two jars! $66 6:30 p.m. — Land in Singapore. This airport is #goals — it takes just 20 minutes from the plane to the taxi stand. Take a Grab home. ($15 expensed) 8 p.m. — My friend is cooking dinner for me tonight, so I head over to her place. I end up spending a lot of the time catching up on work I didn't get done while in transit. I bribe my friends into forgiving this rudeness with a bottle of wine from my stash at home. Head home after dinner, catch up with the roommate, and fall asleep quickly. Daily Total: $66",3,18
"7:30 a.m. — Wake up. Need food. Realize that I have an 8 a.m. call. Survive call. Take a later bus into work and hit traffic. Fingers crossed that I get to work before my 10 a.m. meeting. 11 a.m. — Made it in in time! After the meeting, I head over to the office gym with some coworkers. Given the busy week, I decide to take it easy and work on my form. I ponder getting weight lifting gloves. Grab lunch at the office café afterwards — they have another local favorite today: chicken rice. 6:30 p.m. — Rush out of work to dance class! I'm trying to get myself to a place of work-life balance, and scheduling post-work classes has been a great way of making sure I leave work at a decent time. Dance has been fantastic, but I'm really intimidated by how good everyone in the class is. 8:30 p.m. — Time for evening calls! The Singapore–New York time difference is 12 hours, so there's really never a good time. It's my first time joining this call, and I'll finally get to meet my American counterparts. 8:45 p.m. — I spoke too soon — the call is cancelled! It's too late to jump into the next dance class, and I want to stay for the student performances later, so I walk around looking for food. All I see is a pasta place nearby...so pesto pasta it is! $9.50 12:05 a.m. — The performances are great! Tickets are usually $5, but mine is covered through my dance studio membership. After midnight, some folks decide to stay and practice, but I give into the yawns and Grab home. $12 Daily Total: $21.50",4,18
"7:45 a.m. — Snooze the alarm a bit today since I went to bed (relatively) late last night! I'm heading to a fancy event celebrating women entrepreneurs tonight, so I throw on a long black dress and take a little more care than usual with my makeup. 1 p.m. — It's my manager's last day before maternity leave, so she takes us to a Mexican place for lunch! I order a burrito bowl. Yum. 4 p.m. — More meetings. One more day until Friday! I celebrate with an iced Milo from the fridge. 6 p.m. — Make my way to the event! I miss the shuttle bus in so I have to take a Grab. There's a lot of dialogue about gender expectations in different regions and how it has impacted these amazing women. We really need to be having more of these conversations and putting more infrastructure in place to support diversity (of all kinds). Gender diversity is only one of many things that need to be discussed. I nibble on appetizers and Prosecco. $5 10:30 p.m. — Time to head home. Since I'm not spending much on food this week, I let myself call my umteenth Grab ride home for the week. $12 Daily Total: $17",5,18
"7 a.m. — Morning again?! Head to the office and decide to make a PB&J for breakfast. 10:30 a.m. — Have a coffee catch up with a former teammate (she moved to another department within the company). We have baristas in the office who know our order by heart — two chai teas. We update each other on our lives, and she scolds me for not going on any dates this week. I promise to do some serious swiping this weekend. 12:30 p.m. — I'm meeting a friend of a friend for lunch. She works in the same org, but on a different floor. I get seafood stew over rice from the office café. She expresses interest in joining the gender equality initiatives in our offices (I'm one of the leads for it), and I invite her to our next committee meeting. 7 p.m. — The day flies by in a blur of meetings and emails! Peak hour surcharges are ridiculous, but I hate being late so I call a Grab! I meet a couple of friends at an Italian place, and we split a burrata appetizer and a bottle of wine. I get a pasta for my main and something chocolate-y for dessert. One of my friends pays for dinner as a thank you for a project I helped him out with recently. $13 10:30 p.m. — We Grab over to our next destination — a small Japanese speakeasy. They serve bespoke drinks, and make me something amazing with gin and elderflower. I head out at around midnight, and try to pay before I go, but my friends won't let me. Drinks on me next time. Call a Grab and head home! $14.50 Daily Total: $27.50",6,18
"8:30 a.m. — Noooooooo! I wanted to sleep in today! Not going to get up. 9:30 a.m. — My hunger gets the better of me and I pop into the kitchen and make myself breakfast from random ingredients in the fridge. Then I do some reading in bed. 11 a.m. — Drive over to my bouldering gym where I meet a couple of friends. They've changed up the walls, so I start with some easy problems. Super psyched — I have more control over my movement now than I did a few months ago. Then I try a hard wall and realize that I really need to work on building up strength in my triceps. 1 p.m. — Shower and drive into town to meet a friend for tonkatsu! I can't find street parking so I somewhat reluctantly park in a nearby mall ($6.50). We order fried goodness and catch up on life ($25). $31.50 3:30 p.m. — My roommate's in town running errands and wants a ride home. While I wait for her at the mall, I pick up a cute sports shirt and yoga pants. It's sale season, so I get the shirt for half off. $21.20 4 p.m. — We pick up Chinese food on the way home. Dumplings, more fried pork goodness, and stewed vegetables. We're going to have leftovers for DAYS. Not complaining. $20.50 10 p.m. — Some friends are moving, and are having a party to empty their liquor cabinet before they go. I take a Grab there. $5.20 11:55 p.m. — I'm like Cinderella; midnight is my kryptonite. Make the rounds and say goodbye to folks before Grabbing back home! $5.20 Daily Total: $83.60",7,18
"8:45 a.m. — Normally, I don't get up until almost noon on Sundays, but my mom is flying into town for her uncle's funeral, so I need to get up early to pick her up from the airport. Her flight gets in at 9:45, so I plan to leave at 9:30. I'm already exhausted because I went to a housewarming party last night, and then stayed up until 3 a.m. making nine batches of pie crust, followed by a batch of blueberry hand pies (which I froze before baking). Why this madness? I'm throwing a party at my apartment this coming Saturday and I'm planning on making 11 varieties of pies from scratch. I did this last year for my housewarming party and it was huge hit. 9:30 a.m. — While I'm eating one of my go-to breakfasts, a frozen El Monterey mini chicken burrito, my mom calls me to tell me that she's already off the plane. I'm not in my car yet. Oops. Luckily there is very little traffic on Sunday mornings, so I'm able to get there in less than 30 minutes. 10 a.m. — My mom and I drive to the funeral home for the wake. I don't really feel like going because I have stuff to do, I've never met this great-uncle, and I'm nowhere near appropriately dressed for the occasion (jeans, hoodie, sneakers, and North Face fleece jacket). However, my mom convinces me in a way that only Vietnamese mothers can, so I give in and go with the family. 11 a.m. — It's mostly my mom's extended family members at the wake, who I'm not very familiar with. I'm horribly underdressed, but at least my North Face jacket is black. Mostly I just feel awkward, especially when we do the white headband tying ceremony. In Vietnamese culture, all relatives down to grandchildren wear white headbands to the deceased's funeral, while great-grandchildren wear yellow and great-great grandchildren wear red. There's a reception afterwards with a fantastic spread of Vietnamese goodies — Pâté chaud (meat pies in puff pastry), banh mi sandwiches, sweet sesame balls, and banh gio (meat rice dumplings wrapped in banana leaf). There's a lot leftover, so I grab a few banh mis and banh gio for later. 1 p.m. — We're back at my cousin's house. I hang out and chat with my relatives for another hour before saying goodbye to my mother. My cousin sends me home with bun rieu (crab and tomato noodle soup) that she made this morning. 2 p.m. — Because gas is cheaper in San Jose, I decide to fill up my tank at a nearby Shell station. $38 2:30 p.m. — I'm planning to make Pâté chaud for my pie party, which requires chopped up wood ear mushroom, so I stop by a 99 Ranch supermarket in Cupertino. I grab a small package of dried wood ear and an imported Nissin Cup Noodle in crab flavor. (I have a weakness for instant ramen.) $3.18 3:15 p.m. — I'm finally home, so I start laundry and get started on pie-making. I make two batches of Pâté chaud pies (with ground chicken) — 24 pies total. I put the unbaked pies away in the freezer. 5 p.m. — My boyfriend is coming over soon, so I quickly vacuum and straighten up my place. After he arrives, I start making dinner for us. In effort to clear out as much space in my freezer for all the pies I'll be freezing, I make a simple dinner of potsticker stir-fry — frozen Trader Joe's crab and sriracha dumplings and frozen Asian stir fry veggies. It's actually better than I anticipated, although I accidentally burn some of the dumplings. We eat it with Ito En jasmine tea, which I always have on hand at home. 8 p.m. — After dinner, I make spinach and artichoke hand pies and put them into the freezer. Then I watch an episodes of hosted by Sterling K. Brown. I've recently started binge-watching , which is not my usual type of TV show, but I'm really enjoying it. 11:30 p.m. — My boyfriend goes to sleep while I go into the living room and work on my LEGO Star Wars set for awhile. I'm a huge Star Wars and LEGO fan, and I own most of the LEGO Star Wars Ultimate Collector's Edition sets, which I have displayed in my living room. Afterwards, I get ready for bed. My nightly routine involves showering, flossing and brushing my teeth, removing my contact lenses, putting on eye and face cream, and then finally putting in my night guard. The night guard is annoying, but I need it because I grind my teeth in my sleep. Daily Total: $41.18",1,19
"9 a.m. — Today is a HUGE day for me. For nearly a decade, I've dreamt of becoming a gameplay engineer, but lack of knowledge and experience had prevented me from achieving that dream. But two weeks ago, after years of struggling (even getting fired at one point), I was told that my transfer from quality engineering to gameplay engineering was approved. Today is my first day at my DREAM JOB. I still can't believe it. However, I'm also really stressed out because I only got 10 days advance warning, and I feel like I am not at all prepared. Luckily, I'm staying on the same game (in a very popular game franchise), so I'm already familiar with some of the code base. Dreams really do come true! 9:30 a.m. — After my usual morning habit of checking my social media and emails on my phone, I finally get out of bed to brush my teeth, wash my face, and put in my contact lenses. Then I put on eye cream, face serum, sunscreen (Shiseido's Urban Environment Oil-Free UV Protector), and a few spritzes of the Fresh Sugar Lychee perfume (one of the few perfumes that I actually like). Next I flat-iron my hair and get dressed. My usual uniform is a hoodie, t-shirt, skinny jeans, and sneakers. 10 a.m. — After getting ready, I have a CalNaturale Svelte protein shake (cappuccino-flavored) for breakfast, and make myself an English muffin sandwich, which I pack up for lunch, along with two banh mi sandwiches from yesterday. I also pack up clothes and toiletries for tomorrow, as I'm staying at my boyfriend's tonight. 10:30 a.m. — I arrive at work and start packing up my old desk to move over to my new one. I don't have to change floors and I don't have a lot of cubicle decorations (just a rolling filing cabinet filled with snacks), so it's relatively painless. 12 p.m. — I eat my English muffin sandwich and one of the banh mis, plus my usual mug of jasmine green tea. I typically eat my lunches at my desk while watching TV on my computer. 6:30 p.m. — After a day of moving cubicles, setting up gameplay tools, and munching on salt-and-pepper pistachios, my boyfriend (who also works on the same game as me, but in a different role and team) and I head to the on-site company gym. My right knee has been giving me trouble lately, so I've been doing mostly elliptical (followed by leg and foot exercises for my bad feet). I also use the gym as an opportunity to catch up on TV shows on my phone. At the moment, I'm finishing up the final season of the reboot of on Hulu. 7:30 p.m. — We drive over to nearby Spanish tapas restaurant to celebrate my first day as a gameplay engineer and our two year anniversary. After toasting with glasses of cava, we have viera con espuma de salmon (smoked salmon and scallops toast), huevos escalfados (eggs baked in spinach, chickpeas, and cheese), carne a la parrilla (sirloin with potatoes), and flan. The flan is so good that all I want to do is lick the plate clean but I suppose we ARE in public. My boyfriend pays. 9:30 p.m. — We drive over to my boyfriend's house for the night. From Sunday to Wednesday, we alternate places, and then from Thursday to Saturday, we stay at our own places, since that's when he has his son staying with him. We just chill and watch before going to bed. Daily Total: $0",2,19
"9 a.m. — I wake up and see on my phone that one of my eBay items, a pair of Juicy Couture hair pins, sold a few hours ago for $15, and I am thrilled. I sell things on eBay as my side hustle. I've accumulated a lot of crap (mostly clothing, beauty products, and geek toys) over the years due to my shopaholic ways, and I've turned to eBay as a way of decluttering but also earning spending money for myself. I make about $500 every two months. 10:30 a.m. — Once I get to work, I have a protein shake and I start working on a new feature. 11:15 a.m. — I get another eBay sold notification, this time for a Hearthstone (the Blizzard card game) stress ball for $5. I always feel so oddly happy getting these “Your Item Sold” notifications, even if it's not for very much. 12 p.m. — Lunch is a banh mi sandwich and jasmine green tea at my desk. I'm still a bit peckish afterward, so I grab a mini Korean noodle salad from the cafeteria to supplement. I'll need it, seeing as today is a long day of meetings, followed by coding. I'm feeling frustrated because a lot of the stuff being discussed is going over my head and honestly, I'm really afraid of failing. I've already been fired once for underperformance before, and it would kill me if it happened again. $1.63 4 p.m. — Midday snack of hummus crisps. I keep my ""snack"" cabinet under my desk, which I have filled with loads of snacks, instant noodles, and beverages. 6:30 p.m. — Off to the gym with my boyfriend again. After our workout, we head over to my place. I'm too tired to do anything elaborate for dinner, so I pull out a bag of Trader Joe's Linguine with Clam Sauce and throw in frozen cooked shrimp and kale. 9 p.m. — We cuddle up on my bed and watch a episode called “Shut Up and Dance.” It's a really disturbing episode. Afterwards, my boyfriend goes to sleep, and I finish working on my LEGO project. It finally goes up in my display bookshelf and it is BEAUTIFUL. After admiring my handiwork, I get ready for bed. It's only Tuesday, but I'm already mentally worn out. Even so, I have a hard time falling asleep because I keep think about that damned episode. Daily Total: $1.63",3,19
"9 a.m. — I wake up, get ready, and pack up my stuff for my overnight stay at my BF's. I also print a shipping label and a packing slip for the eBay items I sold yesterday. 10:30 a.m. — Once I arrive to work, I drop off the eBay package at my floor's mail area, which gets picked up around noon daily. Having this means I never have to go to the post office, which saves me so much time. When I get to my desk, I have a protein shake for breakfast. 12 p.m. — Desk lunch today. Luckily, I have a banh gio in the fridge, so I heat it up and hope that no one is offended by the smell. I'm still hungry afterwards, so I get one of my Nong Shim instant noodle bowls from my snack cabinet and eat that as well. 3 p.m. — The rest of the afternoon is meetings and more coding. I'm very slowly getting the hang of our toolset. I eat more hummus crisps for a snack. 6:30 p.m. — After work, I decide that it might be in my best interest to pick up cheap alcoholic beverages for my Pie Party, so I stop by Trader Joe's to buy some hard cider, those wonderful $4 four-pack canned rosés, a raspberry lambic, and a carton of vegetable broth (for one of my pies). $24.95 7 p.m. — Wednesday is Trivia Night for me, my boyfriend, and a bunch of our coworkers. I was a trivia nerd in high school, so naturally, my head is full of information that serves no purpose other than winning at trivia. It's at a nearby Irish bar that allows you to bring in food, so after I park my car, I walk over to Bonchon to get tteok-bokki (spicy rice cakes with fish cakes and cheese). Then I join my coworkers (including my boyfriend) at the bar. $14.12 10 p.m. — We get seventh place in trivia. Typically there's at least a dozen teams competing at this bar, and some of them are really good. Each game is split up into six rounds, including a picture round, where they give you a handout with pictures of various celebrities, movies, and landmarks that you have to identify. All those years of reading celebrity gossip really pay off! Trivia Night has a two drink minimum, so I get myself a glass of pinot grigio and a Moscow Mule, and my boyfriend gets two Jack and Cokes. I pay for the both of us. $33 10:30 p.m. — I drive out to my boyfriend's house to spend the night. I didn't finish the tteok-bokki, so I bring it with me. We're too tired to watch any TV, so we just cuddle and chat. Once my boyfriend goes to sleep, I browse the iOS App Store to check out some games. To my horror, I realize that a sequel to Monument Valley (a puzzle game that I really enjoy) has already been out since LAST JUNE. I quickly buy it and start playing. $4.99 11:30 p.m. — Right before I fall asleep, I get yet another eBay sold notification on my phone. This time it's an Urban Decay eyeshadow palette, selling for $35! Daily Total: $77.06",4,19
"9 a.m. — The usual wakeup and get ready routine. I arrive at work and have my usual protein shake for breakfast. 12 p.m. — My new team has a monthly lunch, which happens to be today. We walk over to a sandwich shop, where I get a crab cake sandwich on Dutch crunch bread, a cup of Italian wedding soup, and a bottle of Ito En dark green tea. I absolutely love crab cakes and Italian wedding soups, so this lunch is especially delicious. My new manager pays for everyone's lunch. 1:30 p.m. — Back to work, where I spend the afternoon asking lots of questions and getting closer to finishing my first feature. I also snack away on Trader Joe's ranch chickpeas. 6:30 p.m. — I'm exhausted and have a lot to do, but I still drag myself to the gym. While walking back to my car afterwards, I get another eBay notification — I sold a Fresh gift set for $90! I'm so happy that it finally sold! 7:40 p.m. — I have one last round of grocery shopping to do for the party, so I drive over to Bev Mo for party drinks — a pack of club soda, Schofferhofer Grapefruit Hefeweizen beer, a bottle of Kahlua, a bottle of Bacardi Light rum, and a tiny bottle of brandy. $58.70 8 p.m. — I drive over to the Whole Foods nearby and buy a pint of half and half, dill relish, macarons, Dufour puff pastry, ground beef, ground lamb, fresh herbs, strawberries, an orange, a lemon, and then on a whim, a dozen limes, because I have this idea that I'll make Moscow Mules and strawberry mojitos at the party. $99.21 8:45 p.m. — I arrive back at my apartment, and after putting all of my groceries away, I start heating up dinner, which is the bun rieu that my cousin sent me home with last Sunday. 10 p.m. — I get started on two batches of cheeseburger hand pies. There're basically like hot pockets, but much tastier. I put them into the freezer. I also chop up most of the vegetables I'll need for Friday and Saturday — several cups of carrots, celery, and yellow onions. These all go into Tupperware in the fridge. 1 a.m. — I finally start getting ready for bed — shower, brush teeth, then relax. I peruse the J.Crew Factory and Nike websites to see if the items that I want are on sale. I'm a casual cosplayer and I'm planning to dress up as Gogo Yubari from this year for PAX West (the Penny Arcade Expo in Seattle) and Halloween. They're not, so I hold off on purchasing.

"9 a.m. — I groggily wake up. These super late nights are really starting to get to me. After doing my normal routine, I print out labels for the last two eBay items and package them up. For breakfast, I have Lucky Charms with milk. 10:30 a.m. — Arrive to work. I send out a code review for my code change for my very first gameplay feature. It's standard practice for software engineers to send code reviews out to their peers/managers to look at to make sure they didn't miss anything and give suggestions on what they can do better. 12 p.m. — Normally on Fridays, I go out to lunch with my boyfriend, but he needs to head home early today, so I head over to the cafeteria and get a customizable Asian noodle soup bowl, which I eat at my desk while watching . $7.56 1 p.m. — I got some comments on my code suggesting some minor changes, so I spend time discussing/arguing them with people before finally making said changes and running more tests. I drink some green jasmine tea from the kitchen. 4:30 p.m. — Finally! All tests passed, so I submit my very first feature to our code repository. I hope to god that I didn't break anything (which would be especially embarrassing for my first week). It's really bad practice to leave work right after a submission (because if something breaks, then I need to be around to fix it), but I have no choice today. I leave early in order to hit the Safeway right by my apartment before the rush hour traffic gets bad, but also so that I can get home early to get going on my pie making. I quickly grab a russet potato and go through the self-checkout. $1.46 5:15 p.m. — Once home, I hit the ground running with my pie-making. I start by making full size chocolate rum custard pie and chocolate bourbon pecan pie. The pecan pie is definitely one of my best pies, but mostly because I make it less sweet than typical pecan pie. 7:30 p.m. — I season chicken breast with salt, pepper, and olive oil and bake it in the oven for a half hour. While it's baking, I eat a Nong Shim spicy ramen bowl for dinner. At this point, I'm really too tired to make myself a proper dinner. I watch an episode of on Hulu while eating the ramen. 8:30 p.m. — I make the filling for my two batches of chicken pot pie using the chicken breasts that I just baked (although I have to shred them, which takes longer than it ought to) and the vegetables that I chopped last night. I make it with my secret ingredient: curry powder. Since it has to cool completely, the rest of the pie assembly will have to wait until tomorrow. Then I start on the shepherd's pie (using Alton Brown's recipe), followed by the filling for the mini Strawberry pies, and then a pitcher of sangria. I almost never use the same recipe each time I make sangria, so this one has merlot, brandy, triple sec, fruit juice, and an apple (for now). I put it into the fridge to let it sit overnight. 12:15 a.m. — I finally clean the kitchen, followed by a very thorough scrubbing of my shower/tub. My shower has clear glass doors, and they're a bit dingy at the moment. I don't want my guests judging me on the state of my bathroom tomorrow. 2 a.m. — I take a shower, and while I'm waiting for my hair to dry, I put away my clutter and take out the recycling. I finally collapse into bed much later. Even so, it takes me awhile to fall asleep because I'm so stressed and anxious for tomorrow. Daily Total: $9.02",6,19
"8:30 a.m. — I force myself to wake up early today so that I can finish assembling my pies. Getting up this early on a weekend is highly unusual for me, but there is so much to be done before the party starts at 3:14 (Pi time, obviously) today. After doing my normal bathroom routine, I make myself a cup of Starbucks instant coffee. While sipping my coffee, I decide to impulsively buy a digital copy of from Amazon Video so my friends and I can watch it while we eat pie. $14.99 9:30 a.m. — I make and assemble curry root vegetable pies (eight individual tins) and mini strawberry pies (nine muffin tin-sized pies), and then add sliced citrus fruits to the pitcher of sangria. Apparently, you can't let citrus fruits sit in alcohol for too long, or the rind will impart a bitter flavor, which is why I didn't put them into the sangria last night. Then I start on the final pie: Fireball apple pie. I peel and slice up eight apples and put them into a large mixing bowl. Then I dump an ENTIRE bottle of Fireball whiskey over the apples and let them soak for four hours. 12 p.m. — I eat a quick lunch of curry cup noodles and watch more while eating. 12:45 p.m. — I assemble the chicken pot pies and clean up. I scour the kitchen countertops (which are crusty from rolling out all the pie dough), clean the bathroom mirror, counter, sink, and toilet, and vacuum the floors. 3:14 p.m. — The party has officially started, but thankfully, no one is here yet. I start preheating the oven, and then hastily Swiffer my hardwood floors (using dry, then wet Swiffer pads). Yes, I like my floors very clean. 3:40 p.m. — The first guest has arrived (one of my coworkers), and I am not quite ready, so I excuse myself to get dressed (in my red-and-white gingham check skirt and Grumpy Cat t-shirt) and quickly put on makeup. I have pretty good skin, so all I usually put on is mascara, taupe eyeliner, tinted face primer (I use the one from Dr. Brandt), and light lip gloss. I really don't have time to deal with my hair, so I just plait it into pigtails and call it a day. 4 p.m. — The actual baking begins. The only pie I have ready is the chocolate pie that I baked last night. A steady stream of guests begins arriving. I maintain the flow of pies baking, both in my main oven and in my toaster oven. Unfortunately, because I have to pay attention to multiple timers for my ovens, I'm unable to do anything with the drinks. My previous grandiose plans of making to-order cocktails have failed to come to fruition. 5 p.m. — I drain the sliced apples from the bowl of Fireball, and pour the apple-infused Fireball into a small pitcher. It's actually a huge hit, and even people who don't like Fireball (myself included) actually enjoy it. I make a mental note to make this apple pie more often so that I can bring this Fireball to parties. 6 p.m. — The party is in full swing. I have over 20 guests crammed my living/dining area and they are LOUD. They're playing Codenames (the word association game) and Scrawl (which is kinda like a dirty adult version of Telephone and Pictionary combined). I desperately want to join in on the Scrawl madness, but I gotta focus on the pies. I finally bake the Fireball apple pie (which has a large Pi symbol carved on top). Hot pies are coming out at a steady pace. I put on and then on the TV in the background. 8 p.m. — Some of the guests have left, so I finally get around to eating. I have a Pâté chaud, a spinach and artichoke hand pie, half of a cheeseburger pie, a blueberry hand pie, and a tiny slice of the chocolate rum pie. 10 p.m. — More people leave, so I finally get to sit down with a thin slice of the chocolate bourbon pecan pie and watch with the remaining guests. 11 p.m. — The last of my friends leave. My feet and legs are tired, my place is a mess, and I have tons of leftover pies. I quickly put away food in the fridge, throw away trash, and load up the dishwasher before retiring for the night. The dirty counters and pots/pans/trays can wait until tomorrow. Whew! This has been too much of a week, and I am so emotionally, physically, and mentally drained. After showering, I sleep for the next 12 hours. Daily Total: $14.99",7,19
"7:10 a.m. — My alarm goes off and I play the snooze/alarm game for half an hour before I finally crack my eyes open for real and try to wake up. I can hear my fiancé in the other room and wonder if he's going to come in and lay with me. I hate waking up early, and he wakes up with the sun, so sometimes he joins me in bed. He doesn't this morning, and I begrudgingly get out of bed and get ready. I got paid today, so I transfer my fiancé $100 towards my portion of our monthly co-op payment while I have my morning tea. He walks me to the bus and then goes back home (since he works from home). 9:10 a.m. — I started drinking coffee again recently for the first time in years, and I love the French bistro at the corner of my office building. I get a small skim latte and a chocolate croissant because I figure I can spare it on payday. $7.53 1 p.m. — My office has a cafeteria, where I get dumplings ($7.59) for lunch. While I eat I text my best friend (who is also my fiancé's cousin). She came over last night and we ordered takeout from our favorite Thai place, but I know she's having issues with her job, so I offer to pay her back for my half. She accepts and I transfer her $20. $27.59 2:30 p.m. — I go online to pay our electric bill ($65.02) and my monthly tuition payment. I moodily pay and think about how a whole third of my check is gone already and I only just got paid today! I love and hate payday. I'm currently contracting and am getting paid way below my usual rate. I love the work, but I haven't gotten paid this little since I first started out in my field. It's frustrating sometimes to be living paycheck to paycheck. I have to budget out monthly expenses by the week, which is difficult for me because I'm used to getting paid larger amounts at once. 4:15 p.m. — My coworker convinces me to go downstairs to Starbucks with her. I manage not to get a coffee (I'll be up until 2 a.m. if I do), but I do get chips and peanut butter cups. $5.98 6 p.m. — On my way home I pick up three bottles of wine ($31.54) from our local liquor store and spend the rest of the evening hanging out with my fiancé and his best friend. Our apartment is in the East Village and we both grew up here in NYC, so friends and family frequently stop by. His friend gives me a $25 Starbucks card he got that he says he's never going to use, so I upload it into my app. I go to bed around 11 and my fiancé follows a few minutes later. $31.54 Daily Total: $72.64",1,20
"10 a.m. — I wake up and enjoy the fact that I don't have an alarm today! My fiancé is playing videos game in the living room and I make a shake with leftover blood oranges, yogurt, honey, almond butter, and almond milk. It's not very good and I'm disappointed. My fiancé and I lounge around and talk before I leave to get on with my day. We make plans to do errands later and I kiss him goodbye. 12:15 p.m. — I love, love, love my manicure place, which is a hair salon in the Meatpacking District, and even though it's a costly expense right now ($27 after tip), getting my nails done makes me feel good. I started coming here over four years ago and have become friendly with the staff. They're having a moving sale, and while my nails dry, I find a perfect necklace for my future sister-in-law's birthday gift. It's so perfect and 60% off, so I decide it's worth it ($18.97). $45.97 3 p.m. — I need a dress for my cousin's wedding that's in a month. My future sister-in-law has a clothing line with a friend, and I decide to walk over to their store to see if they have anything I might like. I hang out and play dress up for a couple hours with her business partner, but decide to wait on getting a dress because the one I really like in my size is out on a photo shoot. I buy a logo t-shirt of their brand. $27.22 6 p.m. — I get home and go food shopping with my fiancé. Since we live in such a central location, we have a choice of several supermarkets and we decide where to go based on what we want to buy. We decide on the middle-priced supermarket and get toilet paper, paper towels, eggs, hemp milk, frozen spinach, frozen mixed veggies, tofu, onions, and seltzer. I pay because my fiancé and I have an agreement that I cover most of the food and he covers the bulk of rent. $46.33 6:45 p.m. — I decide to try a pan chicken recipe from Pinterest that's chicken thighs, lemon, garlic, and rice started on the stovetop and finished in the oven. My food experiments are 90% successful, though I have a chronic habit of confusing chili powder and cayenne pepper (but luckily this one doesn't call for either!). It comes out really well and my fiancé likes it too! 7:10 p.m. — My best friend comes over to hang out, and we all meet my fiancé's cousin a few blocks away at a dive bar. I pay for my and my fiancé's beer. When we get home, our next door neighbor invites us to come over so we have a beer more each before finally going to bed at around 2 a.m. $20 Daily Total: $139.52",2,20
"9 a.m. — I wake up and lay around in bed on my phone. When I finally get up, I have tea and chat with my fiancé. I have schoolwork to do (graduation can't come soon enough!) and I procrastinate actually starting by looking through my emails. I get a lot of fashion and business newsletters and find them relaxing to look through. I'm also obsessed with Pinterest and use it as a mood board for every part of my life. My fiancé suggests we go around the corner to the neighborhood diner we like, and I jump at the chance to not have to figure out food! I order two eggs over medium, roasted breakfast potatoes, bacon, toast, and decaf coffee. My fiancé pays and we bring home leftover bacon and toast. 11:30 a.m. — I'm traveling to the far reaches of Brooklyn today (Sheepshead Bay) for a bridal shower for my cousin-to-be. Last weekend my mom and I went shopping to get gifts from the registry, and now I'm lugging a wooden cutting board set on the subway. It ends up being a pretty quick commute even with the transfer to the bus, and I get there exactly on time. I meet the bride's extended family, and everyone is super nice. I'm extra excited for the wedding! 7 p.m. — I get home and am a little buzzed from the bridal shower, so I decide I need to make a quiche. I use some of the ingredients from yesterday's grocery buy (frozen spinach, eggs, onions), and pour in milk, add in sautéed onions, and crumble the bacon from today's breakfast into the mix. I use a pie crust I have in the freezer and bake it all for an hour. Then I sit and have a glass of wine I probably don't need while my fiancé and I discuss what's going on with his business (he freelances) until we go to bed. Daily Total: $0",3,20
"8:50 a.m. — I leave later than usual this morning and need to buy a new weekly Metrocard ($32). I used to get monthly ones, but since I'm budgeting I buy a new card every Monday. It only takes me about 30 minutes to commute from my apartment to my office in midtown, and I get to my desk around 9:15. 9:20 a.m. — I buy breakfast at my office's cafeteria, an egg on an English muffin, and eat it at my desk. It's a little dry, but I eat it anyway and make a mental note to get hot sauce or something next time. $1.95 11 a.m. — I brought some of yesterday's quiche for lunch, so I don't have to buy lunch today! I eat it before the bulk of my meetings. Mondays are busy for me, and I often have recaps to do after all my meetings. By 3:30, I'm totally wiped out and make myself a tea. I keep a couple boxes of tea and honey in my desk because I have a serious tea habit. 7 p.m. — My fiancé went out with a friend and I rarely get an evening without him. His working from home means we spend a lot time together and even though I love it (and him!), I like my alone time. I order in Thai and get him pineapple fried rice to eat for lunch tomorrow and myself vegetable soup and fried spring rolls. I chill out until he comes home and we watch Netflix until bed around 10 p.m. $23.60 Daily Total: $25.55",4,20
"7:10 a.m. — Today is a long day for me because I have work and then class. I make tea while I get ready and throw it in my to-go bottle before my fiancé walks me to the bus. 11:30 a.m. — I amazingly have no meetings until the afternoon, so I eat lunch early because I forgot to get breakfast while working on some things. I get chicken and pork souvlaki with collard greens from the cafeteria. Then, I make a tea and nibble on chocolate lollipops I got from the bridal shower on Sunday. $8.08 5:45 p.m. — I had shoes being fixed at the cobbler, so I pick them up and they look perfect! These are my favorite pair of designer shoes, and I wear them to work a lot, so I'm super happy to have them back. I had paid for half of the repair when I dropped them off, so now I pay the second half. $17 6 p.m. — I grab a salad from the deli at the corner of my school. I get mixed greens, beets, chickpeas, olives, mozzarella, and a hardboiled egg with balsamic and olive oil. I also buy a hazelnut and chocolate dipped yogurt bar thing that sounds great. They give discounts to students, so I take advantage, but it only really saves me $1. Still, I'm going to miss using my student ID for discounts! I go into school and eat while I wait for class to start at 6:30. $10.11 8:20 p.m. — Class gets out a little early. My fiancé is out and I realize I've forgotten my keys! UGH. Luckily, his mom lives in the building, so I call her and we hang out while I wait for my fiancé to come home. She offers me veggie soup she made (she's a great cook and recently became vegan), but I decline since I'm still full from my salad. My fiancé gets home at around 10 p.m. and we work on a video project of his until we go to bed around 11:30. I'm exhausted! Daily Total: $35.19",5,20
"7:10 a.m. — Another morning of making tea while I get ready for work. 12:20 p.m. — They have baked ziti and chicken parmesan at the cafeteria today and I'm super excited to have some comfort food on such a cold day! I get a sparkling water as well and eat at my desk. Some coworkers tell us there's free fruit and cheese in the kitchen on our floor, so I also get pineapple, melons, and strawberries as dessert. Perfect. $8.28 3 p.m. — I have a meeting from 2:30 to 3:30. Our part is done pretty quickly, so we leave the meeting after 20 minutes. One of the cool things about this job is they don't like to waste people's time in meetings they don't have to be in, so if the part you needed to be there for is over, you don't have to stay. It's a great policy. I get to leave early today, which means cuddling at home with the fiancé! 5 p.m. — For dinner, I make steamed green beans, quinoa, and baked tofu that I toss with teriyaki sauce, garlic, and sriracha. It all comes out great and we eat while we watch a movie and drink wine. Daily Total: $8.28",6,20
"8:10 a.m. — I am super unhappy to get up today because I stayed up late and last night's wine is making me a little groggy. I make my tea and sleepwalk through my morning routine. My fiancé walks me to the bus, which gets stuck in traffic, and I quietly curse all the construction on 14th Street (and the city in general). I still manage to get to work around 9:15 and set up for meetings I have today. Lots of the ones from yesterday got pushed to today. Yay. 11:30 a.m. — I have a Groupon for this health food store near my job that I've been meaning to use, so I walk over at lunch and buy raw honey, almond butter, bulk quinoa, two boxes of tea, two coconut yogurts, two kombuchas, a ready-made veggie sushi, and a few sweet potatoes (my fiancé's favorite). It comes to $54.23, but with the Groupon, I only spend $24.23. More than I wanted to spend, but now I have snacks at work and lunch for today. $24.23 6:10 p.m. — There's an art gallery in my building and they're doing a show tomorrow that I agreed to be part of (as a living art installation!), so I go upstairs to chat with the artist while the curator sets up. I have a beer and then go back to my apartment, feeling excited for the show tomorrow. 8 p.m. — My fiancé got a Groupon for all-you-can-eat sushi at a local sushi spot we've never been to. It ends up being really good and we gorge on sushi, beers, and sake until the two-hour limit is up! We talk about the sustainability company I want to start and my fiancé's art projects, and then walk home. I call my mom to see if she wants to come to the art show tomorrow, and then try to read in bed, but pass out immediately before reading a page. Daily Total: $24.23",7,20
"7:30 a.m. — I wake up at my boyfriend's house just as he's leaving for work. He kisses me goodbye and lets me know that there's coffee waiting downstairs. I pour myself a big ‘ol cup and drive back to my apartment to get ready for work. We live about five minutes away from each other — it's so convenient! 9:15 a.m. — I arrive at work, settle in, and go to make myself breakfast when I realize I forgot to bring almond milk for my cereal. I head downstairs to hunt for dairy-free milk. I see a little “juice box” of soy milk behind the Starbucks counter and the cashier sells it to me for $2.50. Breakfast is grape nuts with banana slices and coffee. $2.50 12:30 p.m. — Free lunch today courtesy of my supervisor as we welcome the newest copywriter to our team! It's her first day, so all of us copywriters hang out and chat over pizza and salad. The fun ends early for me and my teammate, as we have to head back to the most boring meeting ever. 3:30 p.m. — I'm starving, so I grab a plate of salad and a few chips and salsa from the common area. There's usually leftovers from team lunches sitting out somewhere in the office. 5 p.m. — I bring a gym bag with me to work every day with the intention of working out immediately after but ... it doesn't always happen. I make it to the gym after work maybe two or three times a week, and today is not one of those days. Instead, I drive over to my boyfriend's house because we're both sleepy and want to cuddle in this depressing, cold, rainy weather we've had all month. We make ourselves tea and chill out on the couch for a bit, watching Hulu and dozing off intermittently. 7:30 p.m. — After being lazy for a bit, we scrape ourselves off the couch and head to the gym. 9 p.m. — I get back to my apartment and heat up a bowl of vegetable wild rice soup I made for the week. Then I sneak a few bites of chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream and decide to dive into the Netflix series with my roommate. We watch two episodes while we silently tag each other in funny videos and memes on Instagram. 11:30 p.m. — After showering, I immediately jump into bed. I've been a zombie all day and don't have the energy to prep my work stuff or clean up my room. I vow to take care of all that tomorrow… Daily Total: $2.50",1,21
"7:30 a.m. — Wake up to freaking snow outside. Damn you, Michigan! It's spring, please give us a break. Slowly, I start a pot of coffee, put on my makeup, and grudgingly slide into a turtleneck. I put together a salad for lunch and pack my breakfast, too. I usually don't eat breakfast at home because it takes a bit for me to feel hungry after waking up. 9:15 a.m. — Get to work, make myself more coffee, and dig into my Greek yogurt with diced strawberries and protein granola. 11 a.m. — It's a slow day for me today, which makes me sleepy. I like being busy at work! I make myself a chai latte and work on copy decks. 12:30 p.m. — I head to the atrium in my building to each lunch alone and away from a computer screen. I try to avoid all technology during lunch, just to give my eyes a break. I made a Caesar salad with blackened tempeh and paired it with an apple and a Clif bar. 4:45 p.m. — Leave work and head straight home instead of the gym. Ugh. Get it together girl. But like, I'm soooo sleepy. I munch on Garden of Eatin's Red Hot Blues (VERY ADDICTING) and watch an episode of before taking a lil' cat nap. 6:30 p.m. — Wake up, putz around, eat leftover spaghetti and veggie meatballs, and go to the gym! I feel good about it, but not gonna lie, I was burping up spaghetti breath the whole time. 9 p.m. — I peruse the internet for freelance gigs. I'm trying to figure out a solid side hustle since I want to save up aggressively and pay all my bills...but also buy new sneakers here and there (I have a shoe obsession that's only grown stronger after landing a full-time job). I jot down promising ideas into my notebook. 10 p.m. — After cleaning my room, I read , scroll through my phone for a bit, take a shower, and then hit the hay around 11:45 p.m. Daily Total: $0",2,21
"7:15 a.m. — Wake up from CRAZY weird dreams, internally try to analyze why they're always so effed up, and then proceed with my morning routine: skincare, makeup, outfit, pack food, pack gym bag, listen to NPR on my drive. 9:15 a.m. — Get to work and make myself quinoa oatmeal with protein granola, banana slices, and a drizzle of honey. I head into our weekly Wednesday morning meeting with our biggest client, where they phone in, review everything the creative team's worked on, rip it to shreds, and then leave us to deal with the damage. This week they are particularly keen to ripping my copy apart. I take notes on the edits they want and then make myself a healing cup of coffee afterwards. 12:45 p.m. — I heat up my lunch of vegetable and wild rice soup and gaze out the windows of the 21st floor. Super exciting stuff happening over here. I'm usually pretty quiet and hermit-like in the beginning of the workweek because I tend to exhaust myself with fun and chaos over the weekends. I need a bit of peace and quiet to reel it all back in. 3:30 p.m. — Hooooooly crap I am antsy. Usually I'm drowning in work, but this week is the total opposite. I can't focus for shit right now. I make myself coffee and attempt to draft out concepts for a big program we're developing. 5:15 p.m. — I drive straight to the gym and do a 30-minute HIIT workout that kicks my butt. Weighted squats, weighted sit ups, chest presses, and burpees. Good lawd was I breathing heavy after that one. 6:30 p.m. — Back home, I make myself a veggie sandwich with a runny egg smooshed inside, with strawberries and baked chips on the side. While I'm eating, I catch another episode of . Why am I so late on this show? I really like it — Mickey in particular. She's the shit (albeit kind of a mess), but she reminds me of myself and I kind of want to be her BFF? 8:30 p.m. — My boyfriend comes over and we chat for a minute before heading down the street to Hamtramck. Hamtramck is a two-square mile city right in the middle of Detroit...literally a city within a city. I LOVE Hamtramck. It's teeming with culture, artists, authentic Bangladeshi and Yemen food, and all my favorite dive bars. We head to one of said bars to celebrate a friend's birthday. I order a porter on draft and my boyfriend gets a bottled IPA. I pay in cash. $11 11 p.m. — My BF is starving and he wants Grandy's Coney Island. It's a drive-through; there's a bunch of them scattered around the city, including one right by my apartment. He gets a Coney Dog and chili cheese fries, and he gets me my kryptonite: squeeze cheese fries. We devour and pass out for the night. Daily Total: $11",3,21
"8 a.m. — I wake up, put my makeup on, and make myself a tempeh Caesar salad wrap for lunch. I pack clementines and my breakfast, too. I wasn't going to make coffee because I was feeling lazy, but I can feel the coffee pot staring into my soul. I cave and make enough to fill up an extra large mug. 9:15 a.m. — Wow. I've been wearing new black flats for less than an hour and I can already feel them skinning my heels off. I grab Band-Aids, but they're not helping. I'm walking around work like I have a stick lodged up my ass. This ain't gonna fly. I hunker down at my desk and work away at a couple assignments, then Google the closest shoe store. 12 p.m. — Arrive to Payless and end up leaving pleasantly surprised with a chic pair of platform slip-ons. It's slightly annoying because now I have a useless pair of flats that are too late to return, but I know I'll wear these slip-ons religiously. I switch shoes in my car and balance is restored in the universe. $28.33 1:30 p.m. — I eat lunch at my desk and get up a few times to munch on extra Chipotle chips in the kitchen. I work on a confusing program that's getting messier and messier with each client request/revision and open up Spotify to get me through the madness. I listen to Death Cab for Cutie and Hiatus Kaiyote. I also pay our gas/electric bill, plus my share of the WiFi. My roommate reimburses me $70 via Facebook cash. 5:15 p.m. — I get back to my apartment and sprawl out on my couch for a bit. I try to take a cat nap, but I had two cups of coffee for no reason at 4, so I'm feeling restless. I watch an episode of where Mickey is a BRAT. Don't know how I feel about this chick anymore. I plug in my record player, put on a Best Coast album, and clean up the living room and my bedroom. 7 p.m. — My boyfriend comes over with a friend. They hang in the living room while I finish getting ready, which means reapplying my blush and slappin' on dry shampoo, a.k.a. my life blood. 7:45 p.m. — We head to Hamtramck again to hit another favorite dive bar for $1 Taco Thursdays. I love the bartenders here — they are absolute GEMS of human beings. I get a delicious tequila limeade cocktail and two bean tacos, and the boys get about a million chicken, beef, and pulled pork tacos. We eat and drink, but don't stay for long today because there's an exhibition opening that we want to catch. I pay for my tab. $12.65 9 p.m. — We hop over to the Museum of Contemporary Art Detroit. Tonight is the opening reception for an exhibition on Tom of Finland. It's amazing! It was my first time seeing his work in real life, and I was incredibly impressed. Considering the nature of Tom of Finland's work, it drew in a huge crowd, full of leather daddies wearing raunchy leather harnesses, leather chaps — you name it. We say hi to a few people, hang out and chat, and then we're off to the next place. 9:45 p.m. — We make a quick stop at the College for Creative Studies in Midtown. There's a wood firing happening tonight in the ceramics department, and my BF wants to see how it's going. We stop in and chat with students and his old professors. 10:30 p.m. — I drop our friend off at his house because his phone died and his girlfriend was probably wondering where he was. Then, my BF and I head back across town to Hamtramck for karaoke. Fun fact: Detroiters love their karaoke. We've got karaoke seven nights a week here. I go at least once every week, but sometimes we'll go two or three times because it's so frickin' fun! Everyone's just hanging out, drinking, cheering, and singing their favorite songs. I'm a terrible singer, but I still love doing it. My boyfriend, on the other hand, has the voice of an angel. His go-tos are usually Usher, JT, Beyonce (on a good night), and Luther Vandross. Tonight I sing ""Short Skirt, Long Jacket"" by Cake. I drink a Hot Toddy because my throat feels dry. $5 11:30 a.m. — We get back to my boyfriend's house. I take a quick shower because I know my morning zombie self won't, and we go to sleep. Daily Total: $45.98",4,21
"7:30 a.m. — Wake up to my boyfriend smoochin' me goodbye and telling me there's coffee downstairs. I mumble gibberish and fall back asleep for a few. 8 a.m. — Get back to my apartment and do my skincare routine, put on my makeup, change, and pack my lunch and breakfast. I eat a piece of peanut butter toast because I'm really hungry, but I'm secretly hoping someone brings bagels into the office. 9 a.m. — Nobody brings bagels. I sneak off and proceed to cry in the bathroom stall. JK, JK. I make myself quinoa oatmeal and two cups of coffee before settling into my desk. 11 a.m. — I work on copy revisions to the sultry tunes of Michael Jackson. I also Gchat with my sister while we iron out the details of a floral design workshop and pop-up flower bar we're hosting this month. These are our first two events for a floral business we recently conceptualized, so it's really exciting to see things actually happening! All about that side hustle, baby. 12:45 p.m. — After lunch (vegetable wild rice soup), I do a quick Instagram scroll. An ad for Reese's pops up in my feed, and I instantly crave Reese's Pieces, so I grab my wallet to head downstairs to get some. Damn you, Internet. Damn you, Zuckerberg. $3 3 p.m. — The combination of drinking coffee at 2:30 and listening to DJ sets on NTS.live has me peddling out copy like a mad(wo)man. I'm typing a million miles a minute and getting ahead on next week's projects — because, why not? Gotta put this crazed energy to use since I can't be on a dance floor right now. 5:30 p.m. — I get home from work and am crazy hungry. I make myself a black bean fajita bowl. 7:30 p.m. — My boyfriend comes over and we head to Midtown to grab dinner and drinks at the bar I used to work at before landing the job I have now. I order a grilled cheese sandwich with apples and honey inside it, and my boyfriend gets spicy chicken nachos. We get a couple flights of beer so we can try a little of everything, and split the tab. $26.35 9:30 p.m. — My stomach is killing me. I'm doubled over in pain and can't stand up straight. It's the black bean bowl I ate earlier. It's difficult to take a deep breath. My boyfriend seriously thinks we should go Urgent Care, but that's the last thing I want to do. We were supposed to head to a park downtown for an outdoor pop-up arcade, but we head back to his place instead. I'm sad and also feel bad about abruptly ruining the night, but my BF repeatedly assures me everything is okay. We head up to the third floor “chill room,” put on , and I take a hit of weed to help with the pain. I stay curled into a ball and end up going to bed around 11:30. Daily Total: $29.35",5,21
"9 a.m. — My boyfriend drops me off at my apartment and then he heads downtown to work on a freelance gig. I make myself coffee and an egg sandwich and read a few pages of . Today we're getting a new stove installed, and my landlord said the guys will be there between 10 a.m. and noon. I clean the old stove and pick up the living room so it'll be easier to install. 11:30 a.m. — The stove boys show up with a shiny, beautiful, FUNCTIONING new appliance. Yay, so exciting! Our previous stove was getting really sketchy. Sometimes the oven wouldn't turn off, and half the burners didn't work. My landlord shows up, signs the invoice, and leaves my roommate and me to enjoy! 2:30 p.m. — After showering and getting ready for the day, I drive to CVS to grab film for my camera and then drive over to my boyfriend's house and eat my leftover grilled cheese sandwich. We hop into his car and head to Third Man Records on Cass Corridor to catch our friend's band performing for Record Store Day. $18.01 4:30 p.m. — The show is great! We say hi to the band, roam for a bit, and then my BF runs into a group of friends he went to college with. The small talk turns into the group heading across the street for a quick beer and pizza. I buy a pineapple jalapeño IPA for myself and a double IPA for bae. $13 5:30 p.m. — BF and I split off from the group and head to the Nike store downtown. I really want a new pair of sneaks! Unfortunately, nothing really catches my eye (well, there was one pair, but naturally they were the most expensive ones on the shelf and I refused), so we drive back to his place empty-handed. 7 p.m. — My boyfriend's been acting quiet and weird and totally disconnected all day. He says he's just not feeling very sociable, which is totally fine, but I'm frustrated that he asked me to hang out when really he wants to be alone. I would've been completely fine going solo all day. I'm not on his wavelength currently — I'm feeling chipper AF and he's bringing me down. I decide to just head back to my place and let him know that we can reconnect later tonight if he feels like joining me. 9 p.m. — I make myself a buffalo vegan chicken wrap and watch Netflix. BF totally ruined my mood for the day. I'm annoyed and stewing over it, but I really don't want to be. I tell myself to just get over it. In the grand scheme of things, my boyfriend having one mopey day is not the end of the world. We'll have plenty of awesome days in the future, just like always. 10:30 p.m. — My BF comes back over, so I guess he's ready to socialize again because the plan is to head to one of our favorite dance parties. My roommate and I drink a couple beers and then my BF drives us all to the party. It's a $5 cover to get in. I give my roommate $1 and my boyfriend $2 to help cover their cashless bums. $8 12:30 a.m. — We're dancing our asses off, per usual. Our friends host this party on a monthly basis and it's one of my favorites! They spin rap, R&B, and house beats all night and everyone gets hot, sweaty, and sexy funky with each other. I drink two gin and waters but only pay for the second one. $5 2:30 a.m. — We get back to my apartment. I wash my makeup off (I refuse to ever sleep with a face full of makeup, no matter how tired, drunk, or lazy I get) and we crash into bed. Daily Total: $44.01",6,21
"10:30 a.m. — We wake up and my boyfriend runs across the street to grab us coffee and breakfast sandwiches. He drops off my food and iced coffee before he runs back out to finish the freelance project he's been working on this weekend. I'm still hungry after my egg and cheese croissant, so I eat a bowl of Greek yogurt with protein granola and strawberries. 12:30 p.m. — After putzing around on the couch for a few hours, I check the weather and see that it's 57 degrees out. I can't let this go to waste! My roommate and I put on jeans and head outside to walk around the city and window shop. 1:30 p.m. — We stop in a bodega for drinks. My roommate gets an Arnold Palmer and I get a can of coconut water with pineapple. I pay for both of us because there's a credit card minimum and my roommate doesn't have any cash on her. $1.99 2:30 p.m. — We check out a vintage store we've always wanted to explore. It's so charming! The building itself is beautiful, and it feels like home inside. I didn't buy anything because I am terrible at making decisions while shopping, but there are amazing vintage purses that I'll be coming back for another day. 3 p.m. — As we're walking back to our apartment, my BF randomly drives by us honking and waving. He makes a scissor gesture with his hands and I remember he's getting a haircut today, so that must be where he's headed. It was cute to randomly see him driving by! It made me smile. 4 p.m. — I'm craving Indian food HARD. I would sell a titty for samosas right now, but I know my roommate doesn't like Indian food. She wants lunch from the café across from our apartment. I order a spicy falafel wrap with extra pickles and a side of cajun fries to go. $9.46 6:15 p.m. — I usually grocery shop and meal prep on Sundays, but with the nice weather, I've been putting it off every hour. My plan was to grocery shop and then workout, but the Planet Fitness in Detroit closes at 7 p.m. tonight. FML, guess that's out. I don't feel like grocery shopping today either, so I'll do it tomorrow night. Instead, I go fill up my gas tank ($25.31) and Facebook Cash my boyfriend $15 (he covered a few drinks and snacks this past weekend). $40.31 7:30 p.m. — Still upset about not being able to gym it up, I decide to go on a run outside. I last 15 minutes and make it a mile and a half. I'll take it. Plus, it's just so nice to breathe in fresh air and people-watch, look at houses, and let my mind wander while running. Maybe I'll keep trying and get up to 30 minutes one day…and then 45! 8:30 p.m. — I eat the second half of my falafel wrap from earlier, take a hit of the delicious ganja, and proceed to take a hot and soothing shower. Afterwards, I do a long overdue sink of dishes and clean up my bedroom. 9:30 p.m. — I put NTS.live on the Bluetooth speaker and do embroidery on a thrifted pair of mom jeans. I'm adding cute little seashells and ocean-themed patches all over them. Not sure if I'll keep them for myself yet or give them to a friend. 11:30 p.m. — I pull together my outfit for work tomorrow, send a goodnight text to bae, grab my vibrator, and end the week on a high note.

"5:35 a.m. — Wake up and get ready for work while my fiancé, B., makes coffee. I choose tea instead of coffee this morning (I put a scoop of my vital proteins collagen in), because I have a wicked sore throat and desperately need something to soothe it! Getting ready for work as a registered nurse is easy. I put on scrubs, brush my teeth, and throw my hair in a bun. I'm out the door at 6 a.m. and get to work by 6:30. B. is a nurse as well, and we try to work the same shifts. 7 a.m. — I start my morning by getting a report from the night shift while I sip on my tea and eat an Rxbar. Today shouldn't be too bad — my patients all sound great! 11 a.m. — I eat my yogurt with blackberries and granola. I tried my hand at making granola a few days ago and actually surprised myself with how well it turned out! It consists of rolled oats, honey, almonds, pecans, walnuts, chia seeds, and coconut. I get green tea from the unit pantry. 1:30 p.m. — My unit gets a pleasant surprise from a past patient — a chocolate gift basket! We all act like we've never seen food before and devour it. It's a slow day at work, so I nibble on chocolate while I chat with HR from my past staff hospital. This is my first travel nursing assignment, and while I like it, there's still a lot of uncertainty as to where/when my next job assignment will be. The unit I come from is very high in acuity and fast-paced, and I am always being challenged in a good way. But this unit has much more stable patients and isn't as fast-paced. I'm concerned I'll lose some of my skills. My old hospital offers me a per diem position so I can keep my skills up, and I have a job to fall back on in case travel nursing doesn't work out! 2:30 p.m. — Lunchtime! I'm glad I packed soup for lunch — my throat is so dry and scratchy and I feel like I'm definitely getting a cold. I eat white bean soup that I made last night and have some zinc that I found in my purse. Hopefully it will keep this cold at bay. The soup is made of carrots, celery, zucchini, onion, cannellini beans, and kale — so yummy! 7:30 p.m. — I leave work at 7:30 and chat with my mom on the phone on the ride home. I just moved out of my parents house in Connecticut and in with my fiancé and his parents in New Hampshire. It's not ideal, but I really can't afford rent with my student loans to pay off. My mom is amazing, and I miss her terribly. 8 p.m. — B. and I get home around the same time. His mom made lemon chicken with asparagus for dinner, and we eat with his parents. We shower and then hang out for the rest of the night. I was planning on having an early night, but B. convinces me to crack a few beers and play pool while watching football. We head to bed around 11. Daily Total: $0",1,22
"4:30 a.m. — I wake up feeling dreadful; my throat is on fire and my head feels like it weighs 100 pounds. I toss and turn for a little but realize it's a loss cause. I go downstairs and raid my in-laws' medicine cabinet. I take decongestant and Tylenol and settle on the couch with tea. I watch trash TV until 6 a.m., and decide to go back to bed and try to get sleep. 9:30 a.m. — Will myself out of bed. I know if I sleep any later, I won't be able to fall asleep tonight. I take more decongestant and plop myself on the couch with tea and warm almond milk with granola. I planned on having a productive Friday, so I hope I can will myself to feel better in a few hours so I can get everything done! In the meantime, I binge 11 a.m. — In the midst of binging, I forgot that today was Beauty Bag day at Whole Foods! I call the store near me and they have a few bags left. I quickly run to my car (amazing how sales on beauty products makes me feel better!) and head to Whole Foods. I've been saving my last $20 this week for this! When I get there, I learn they're all out, but then I decide F it, I saved my last $20 for this, so I'm treating myself to goodies! I get Alaffia Coconut conditioner and shampoo and a pumpkin and honey single-use face mask from Andalou. I've been looking at this shampoo/conditioner for a while, as I've been wanting to try all-natural hair care. My scalp as been SO dry and flaky for the past year, so I'm hoping this helps. The conditioner and shampoo are $11.99 each, but Whole Foods is having a sale — win! $16.57 12 p.m. — I get home and take a long, steamy, hot shower, hoping that it clears out my sinuses. I use my new face mask after and LOVE it! My face actually looks brighter! I will def be buying the full-sized one in the future. I attempt to do a yoga flow, but my head feels too heavy, so I give up and continue to binge for about three more hours. I eat more of the soup I had yesterday for lunch and have more tea. 4 p.m. — I make ""golden milk"" — a.k.a. turmeric, cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, and almond milk. I do laundry and wait for B. to get home from a day of skiing. I was supposed to go, but decided on having a full-fledged sick day instead. 6:30 p.m. — We head to B.'s brother and sister-in-law's house for Friday night pizza and beers. They live a few towns over, and we make it home by 9 p.m. I'm exhausted, so B. graciously finishes the laundry I started earlier and makes my lunch for tomorrow. I take NyQuil and call it night. Daily Total: $16.57",2,22
"5:30 a.m. — B. and I both wake up for work, and he makes coffee and tea while I get ready. I feel so much better than I did yesterday! I still opt for tea this morning. I leave at 6 a.m. and get to work by 6:30. 7 a.m. — I'm walking to get my Rxbar to munch on when I see a coworker walking in with donuts...and obviously opt for a donut instead. 10:30 a.m. — Holy smokes, this day is DRAGGING. We are primarily a surgical floor, and they don't schedule any surgeries on the weekends, so the patient movement is slower today. I snag a coffee from the pantry and have my yogurt, blackberries, and granola. 1:30 p.m. — I FINALLY got to the end of my big soup batch from this week, so eating it for lunch today isn't as bad, since I know I'm all done with it after this! I eat lunch while scrolling through social media. 7:30 p.m. — I munch on a blood orange on my way home from work. We eat chicken, broccoli, and white rice B.'s mom made for dinner. We all try to eat dinner together most nights. B. puts together our lunches for tomorrow with leftovers from dinner while I shower. I do my usual nighttime skin routine: wash my face with Neutrogena cleanser, swipe on Thayers Lavender Witch Hazel, and moisturize with Neutrogena Hydro Boost face lotion. B. and I hang on the couch until we head to bed at 9:45. Daily Total: $0",3,22
"5:40 a.m. — Same routine this morning, except B. leaves before I wake up. Make tea with collagen and head out the door. I get to work by 6:30 and eat an Rxbar during last night's report. But then I start to say something and realize I have no voice! Apparently my cold isn't completely gone yet. 8 a.m. — My coworkers brought in donuts AND bagels today, so I eat a cinnamon bagel with cream cheese and decide to go all in and have a coconut donut too. 12 p.m. — I eat my lunch of leftovers from last night's dinner. My voice is starting to come back — thank goodness. 5 p.m. — Holy smokes, this afternoon is crazy! It may sound weird, but I almost get a high from emergency situations at work. I get such fulfillment from being able to use my knowledge and skills in critical situations to help save patients. There haven't been many situations like this at my new job, so I appreciate this in terms of keeping my skills up! 8 p.m. — I get home from work and hop in the shower. I use my new shampoo and conditioner and am, sadly, disappointed. I wanted to love them so much! I have thick, dry hair, so conditioner is my best friend. This conditioner did not tame the beast. I exfoliate my face with Neutrogena exfoliator, and then put some of Cocokind's turmeric stick on my T-zone. I let that sit while B. and I eat veggie soup his mom made for dinner. We chat about our days and then I finish up my face routine by wiping off the turmeric with my toner and putting on moisturizer. B. and I head to sleep at 10 p.m. Daily Total: $0",4,22
"6:30 a.m. — I snooze my alarm four times (I'm allowed — it's Monday) before finally getting out of bed. I don't have to be at work until 8 a.m. today because I just have class for a new computer system the hospital is getting. I actually get to put real people clothes on today — yay! I throw on leggings, a tank top, a cardigan, sneakers, and makeup. I'm running a tad late and still need to get gas, so I don't have time to make tea or pack a lunch this morning. 7:15 a.m. — Of course the first pump I pull up at isn't working. I contemplate just driving to work and getting gas on the way home, but it's way too risky. I like to try to get at least 400 miles to a tank, so I occasionally (okay, very often) let my tank get wicked low in order to hit that. I go to the next pump and realize it's my credit card that isn't working! I pay with my debit card ($45.32). If this is any indicator of how today is going to be, I'm definitely going to need a coffee. I swing by the Dunkin' drive-through at the gas station for a medium iced coffee ($2.82) and get to work right on time at 8! $48.14 11:30 a.m. — This class is awful! We break for lunch and I go to the café. I get a turkey sandwich with potato chips. $4 12 p.m. — I run to the ATM at work and take out $100. Every Monday, I take out this amount and use it for groceries and anything else I want to do during the week. And then once I'm out, I'm out. If I have cash left over at the end of a week, I just keep in my rainy day (margarita) fund.  I usually put gas, monthly payments, and online purchases on my credit card. I don't like making purchases on my debit, so I'm bummed about the gas. I buy a Kind bar at the gift shop in case I need a snack for the afternoon training session. $2.50 4:40 p.m. — I'm out of class early! I realize I forgot to fax my timesheet to my travel nursing agency, so I do that quickly before heading home. It is SO nice out today, so I roll the windows down on the way home and jam to Dispatch. I get home by 5:30. 6 p.m. — I do my and B.'s laundry that I was supposed to do this morning and clean up a little around the house. B.'s sister, brother, and sister-in-law come over for a birthday dinner for B.'s sister. Steak tips and veggies! B. is stuck at work and can't make it. 8 p.m. — I meet B. and his coworkers at a Mexican restaurant in Manchester for Monday night margs. There's a fundraiser tonight and the profits go to the Boston Marathon victims. B. and I buy $20 worth (we split the cost), and I end up winning a couple weeks of unlimited barre classes! B. gets the drink bill. $10 9:30 p.m. — We get home and have a few gin and seltzers with B.'s parents and sister. In bed by 12:30. Daily Total: $64.64",5,22
"7 a.m. — B. wakes up to spend the day skiing with his mom. I'm meeting a friend from college for lunch outside of Boston this afternoon, so I pass on the ski day and instead watch and fold laundry. I have an English muffin and water for breakfast. 9 a.m. — My friend cancels our plans today because she's sick. It's probably a good thing, because I'm feeling very anxious this morning. I've had anxiety and panic disorder since high school. I haven't had a panic attack in a few years, and my anxiety has been showing itself in new ways lately, but today my anxiety is in it's old school form. I haven't taken my medication in over a month, and I hope I can get past my anxiety today without medication. I take a very hot, steamy shower in hopes of opening up the tightness in my chest. I then do yoga for about an hour to try to recenter my breathing. Yoga with wet hair hanging loose is so cathartic for me. My anxiety used to manifest itself in breath; I would feel like my throat is closing, or that I couldn't breathe. Yoga has been a huge help for me, and today it's doesn't disappoint. 11:30 a.m. — I jinxed myself — I have a panic attack. I call my mom and she helps me breathe through it. God I miss her. 12 p.m. — I decide to venture out of the house to try to keep my mind from straying to anxious thoughts. I go to Trader Joe's and pick up yogurt, sweet potato fries, rolled oats, limes, lemons, hot sauce, broccoli, kombucha, chocolate, and flowers for myself ($30.70). Then I stop by Market Basket to grab chicken breasts, panko breadcrumbs, buttermilk, and wine ($22.42). $53.12 2 p.m. — I feel like an elephant of anxiety is sitting on my chest, and it takes all of my self-control to not have another panic attack. I blare music so I don't hear my anxious thoughts and make dinner. I'm making oven-""fried"" baked chicken with veggies and sweet potato fries. I marinate the chicken and clean the kitchen. 3 p.m. — I pour myself wine, because dammit, I need it. I watch the infamous episode of on DVR and sob like a baby. B. and his mom gets home from skiing and I immediately feel a sense of calmness when I see him. I find that I rely on things other than myself when it comes to my anxiety: my mom, Xanax, B. It makes me sad. But after today, I'm okay with relying on B. We go for a bike ride and the fresh air feels amazing in my lungs. 6 p.m. — B.'s parents are out running errands, so I throw the rest of dinner together for B. and me. We drink wine and talk and just laugh until I don't feel anxious anymore. Then we call it an early night and head to bed around 8:30, chatting until we fall asleep. Daily Total: $53.12",6,22
"5:40 a.m. — B. and I do the usual morning routine. I opt for tea and collagen again this morning. We're out the door by 6 a.m. 10 a.m. — I eat an Rxbar and drink more tea for a mid-morning snack. Today we have a lot of post-ops at the hospital, so it's very fast-paced — just the way I like it! 2 p.m. — I eat leftover chicken and veggies for lunch. B. gets out of work early and swings by work to surprise me. He brings me more tea, kombucha, and smiles. He sits with me for a little while I eat, but then the floor gets crazy, so I have to cut my lunch break short. 8 p.m. — The rest of the day FLIES by! I get home and eat quinoa-stuffed peppers that B. has waiting for me. I shower, then pack for the weekend. After work tomorrow night, B. and I are heading down to CT to visit my family. I am SO excited!! B. plays guitar while I finish getting last minute things in order. We're asleep by 10:30. Daily Total: $0",7,22
"5 a.m. — My three alarms go off, staggered twenty minutes apart. It's Monday, and it certainly feels like it. I am very lucky to live a relatively short bus ride from my work, but I don't like to be late and I don't like to be rushed to get ready. I turn on the space heater in my bedroom, make coffee, stretch, and go through my morning skincare routine while listening to a podcast. On the bus (which I use my monthly transportation card to pay for), I start reading a Steve Erickson novel I picked up this weekend. 9 a.m. — Make coffee at work, which I sip until lunch. 12:15 p.m. — My boss is out of town this week, so I head out a little earlier than my scheduled lunch hour. I go to Whole Foods, where I pick up a couple sweet potatoes for dinner, plus an orange, walnuts, and vegan kale salad for lunch. I eat at the store and read my book. I use a computer all day, so I really try my best not to look at my phone during breaks. $7.69 1 p.m. — Need more caffeine. And I want something sweet. I grab a Diet Dr. Pepper from the gas station by my office before going back in. $2.12 5 p.m. — I leave work, catch my bus, and head home. I throw potatoes in the oven, wash spinach, and read my book for an hour or so. I queue up an episode of when my oven timer goes off. I smother everything with balsamic vinegar and toss on toasted coconut chips. 9:30 p.m. — One episode turned into three. I eat an orange and then commence my full skincare routine. I feel like I'm getting closer to the ultimate routine, but every couple weeks something causes a new problem (or I try to introduce a new product) and I have to figure out where I went wrong. I've started to keep a small notebook where I track my steps and reactions — and it's actually helped me pinpoint problematic combinations, ingredients, and brands. Tonight I'm sad to realize that the toner I wanted to like must go. I set up an hour-long ASMR video and fall asleep. Daily Total: $9.81",1,23
"5:30 a.m. — Wake up to my neighbor's dog barking (and my neighbor shouting at the dog to stop barking). This is a miracle, as I realize I forgot to set my alarms. Regular routine ensues. Thank you, dog. Take the bus to work. 7:30 . a.m.. — Stop for an Americano on my way in. $3.29 12:30 p.m. — I'm killing it at work today, and the morning blows by. Before leaving the city, my boss dropped three big projects in my lap that he'd been putting off for weeks. These projects are very important to the clients they're for, and I'm kind of shocked that they haven't been handled yet. I knock two out before lunch and brag a little (without throwing my boss under the bus) in a few carefully-worded emails to clients. I go to Whole Foods and have apple juice, grapes, and vegetable soup for lunch. I get a few oranges for later. $12.04 5 p.m. — It's super sunny, and I feel good. I catch the bus, find a seat, and read during the ride. 6 p.m. — Hungry and now feeling the mental exhaustion of dealing with support and account representatives all day, I can't quite process putting together a full meal. I get under my blanket with a cup of sencha green tea, a bag of pistachios, and the oranges I bought earlier. I return to a longer novel called that I'm about halfway through. 10 p.m. — Skincare time. I write in the journal that it all feels like it's working for me, especially the Murad Vitamin C toner. I start a patch test of a retinoid from The Ordinary on the side of my neck — I've never ventured into retinoids before and am hopeful they'll cure some old red marks from pimples of years passed. Then I go to bed. Daily Total: $15.33",2,23
"5:40 a.m. — Slept until the third alarm, and I'm okay with it. I usually wake up a couple times every single night and never sleep very well. What is this ""well-rested"" concept? I can see in my eyes that I've slept better today, but also that I probably had too many salted pistachios last night. I swipe on some Sunday Riley Auto Correct cream, cross my fingers that it helps, and get ready as I listen to podcast. No seats are available on the bus this morning, and other passengers' backpacks knock me around; I wish public transit was free. 9:30 a.m. — Several cups of coffee in at work and with little to do until the afternoon (most of my clients are several hours behind Chicago time), I surf Etsy. I've been looking for a pair of earrings for my friend (who doesn't live here) as a congratulatory gift for releasing their new album. I find a pair I like — and think they'll like too — and order them before jumping back into a technical work project. $9.99 12:15 p.m. — Out early for my break, I see it's the first day of the big Whole Foods beauty and skincare sale. I don't even really care for makeup, but I pick up and set down several different cleansers and moisturizers. I'll research them later and see whether any might be worth trying. I buy a new bottle of tea tree oil and Dr. Bronner's soap ($13.32) as well as seed crackers, baba ganoush, and tabbouleh for lunch ($10.17). Then I read SkincareAddiction on Reddit on my phone for an hour. $23.49 5 p.m. — Haven't made up my mind on any of the sale stuff, so I walk a little farther to Aldi after work. I buy quinoa, spinach, black pepper, a pineapple, and an avocado, and ride the bus home. After taking my time, dinner is served: a bowl of quinoa, diced cucumber, wilted spinach, and half an avocado with lemon juice, turmeric, black pepper, leftover baba ganoush, and a few of the seed crackers. I make a cup of pomegranate tea and read , which I've been looking forward to all day. $9.14 9:30 p.m. — I take a shower and think about potential solutions to one of my client's tragic Q1 numbers…and I also think about downloading Tinder and OkCupid again. I had one really good OkCupid date a couple months ago, but the guy got into a serious accident. We texted a lot as he dealt with it, but I just don't think he's interested anymore, which I'm still disappointed by and confused about. I wonder whether he made up the whole accident, and then hate myself for thinking someone would do that. 10:30 p.m. — It occurs to me that I likely meet many of the diagnostic criteria for hikikomori. I resolve to update my dating apps tomorrow. I fall asleep and dream about hermits and invoices. Daily Total: $42.62",3,23
"5 a.m. — Up and at it, today featuring vintage Björk. It is oh so quiet on the bus today, thank goodness, because this novel almost brings me to tears. I buy a huge bag of pistachios on the way to work. $6.26 12:30 p.m. — I've probably consumed the pot of coffee at my office all by myself. I'm jittery and ready for lunch. I get a couple steamed buns, an avocado, and a seaweed salad. Check my personal email once I'm back at the office — Ulta is calling my name with their 21-day sale. I exit the tab and revise some copy. $10.20 5 p.m. — I get to walk home today! It's so sunny out, and I walk whenever I get the chance. I'd like to start running, or so I tell myself. I impulse-buy copies of and by Steve Erickson at Barnes & Noble on my way. $27.51 6:30 p.m. — Then I pick up a couple Japanese sweet potatoes. When I get home, I steam spinach and the sweet potatoes before dousing everything in tamari and topping with coconut chips. My eyes are closing as I eat dinner and flip through the magazine. $2.94 10 p.m. — Wake up with my head beside the half-eaten dinner plate. I apply (for the first time) some new Sunday Riley Tidal Cream after The Ordinary's Hyaluronic Acid, and it smells and feels so good that I decide not to layer my regular moisturizer on top of it. I read the ingredients a few times and then call it a day. Daily Total: $46.91",4,23
"5:20 a.m. — I feel good. My skin looks amazing; all my visible dryness is gone and red spots are minimized. I cleanse and tone and reapply the Tidal, which sinks in like magic. This stuff might be my new holy grail product. I listen to a Caroline Hiron's interview. On the bus, I get a seat right away and finish a chapter. I make coffee and eat pistachios once I'm at the office. I need to plan for my brother's visit this week, but I also have a lot of technical copy to grind through today. I make a reservation at Mana Food Bar, which I've wanted to go to for a while. 12:30 p.m. — Brown rice, avocado, pumpkin, and pumpkin seeds at Whole Foods. While eating, I read another Chicago-based Money Diary. Relatively speaking, I realize I spend a lot of money and time on skincare. But I'm very careful with money and even kind of frugal in other areas. Skincare is a cost that I just cannot give up. $8.28 5 p.m. — I stop at Sephora to buy my mom a trial-sized Sunday Riley Tidal Cream ($24.37) and then Nordstrom Rack to buy my dad a cool pair of socks ($10.09). They've gone through some tough things lately, and I've wanted to send them a small care package. I write a card, package it up, mail it before the post office closes ($6.89), and then walk the rest of the way home. $41.35 8 p.m. — Today I had some great ideas for a new short story, so I begin outlining it and plan to work on it as a project for the weekend. For dinner, I make steamed yams, broccoli, and sauerkraut with dried wakame and tamari. I go through my nighttime routine and then fall asleep to an ASMR video. Daily Total: $49.63",5,23
"5:12 a.m. — Fell asleep early last night and didn't set my alarm, but my body says it's time to get out of bed and make coffee. The one real perk of the unexamined reclusive life is always seeing the sun rise. Happy Saturday. 1 p.m. — After doing laundry, cleaning, and sheet-masking over a few hours (while listening to the podcast), I walk a few miles to my office to grab a package. My mom sent me a couple new pillows. I leave the retinoid that I patch-tested the other day at the office; I think it's too strong for me at my age. I'll send it to my mom next week. I take the bus back home with the pillows under my arms. 5 p.m. — Go for another little walk with a thermos of sencha, and end up at Ulta. I'm turned off enough by aggressive brand reps that I leave without buying anything, which is probably for the best. I go home, make a salad, and read my . Daily Total: $0",6,23
"6 a.m. — Up and ready to deep clean before my brother gets in tonight. 11 a.m. — Of course I'm at Sephora as soon as they open, a.k.a. prime time to get samples and try not to give them all of my money. I repurchase my favorite Algenist sunscreen and force myself not to buy the Sunday Riley kit yet; I'm still waiting on a deluxe sample of Good Genes to arrive that I bought from eBay. But I do still get my three samples. $31.01 1 p.m. — Grocery store run before my brother arrives. He is maybe twice my size and not vegan like I am, so I grab a few things I don't usually buy, just in case: a few pounds of sweet potatoes, romaine, chard, opal apples, pita bread, hummus, tahini, red lentils, and adzuki beans. He'll be here for four days, and we probably won't eat out much; he's as cheap as I am. I eat a couple of the apples when I get home and take a nap. On the weekends I'm somehow exhausted, as if on a schedule, by early afternoon. $14.29 5 p.m. — I vacuum, set up the couch for my brother, and text my roommate a gentle reminder to pay me her share of the bill. It's frustrating how often I have to do this. I am hoping to receive a raise soon and find a studio or one-bedroom when this lease is up in June. My anxiety spikes when I have to repeatedly ask to be paid like this. This is just one thing among many that makes me want to live alone. I look around on Craigslist and different apartment sites, but July 1st is apparently still too far off. 6 p.m. — My brother is due in soon, so I sit and get a coffee at the Starbucks by his Blue Line stop and read my book. After yet another terrible encounter wherein some man tried to hit on me by commenting on my book, my brother texts me that he's here! We walk home and I make a basic lentil soup. After catching up, we call it an early night. $3.29 Daily Total: $48.59",7,23
"6:30 a.m. — Wake up! My BF stayed over last night and doesn't have to work today, so he offers to take care of the wolves while I sleep in. I start work at 7 a.m. and get off at 3:30 p.m. everyday, so it's super nice to get an extra 30 minutes of sleep. My work is super casual, so I just throw on a hoodie and jeans, brush my teeth, and wash my face. Then I grab eggs for breakfast and a leftover turkey burrito bowl and head out the door. 7 a.m. — My office is a five-minute drive from my house, but when it's nice out I choose to ride my bike. It's raining today, unfortunately, so I drive. I check my email and then go to the office kitchen to scramble up two eggs (my go-to breakfast). 8 a.m. — So I totally forgot that our office breakfast program starts today! I'm getting a second breakfast I guess. For $2.50 a meal, a local chef comes in three times a week and makes us food from sustainable ingredients. Today is a poached egg on a bed of pea shoots, a baked potato, and a radish tart with apple and leek vinaigrette salad. It's delicious and super filling on top of the two eggs I ate earlier. (I pay monthly for the breakfasts.) 12:30 p.m. — It's sunny now, so I go outside for a walk. I walk down to the sea wall and grab a ginger-flavored Rise kombucha from the local grocery store. My favorite! I get an hour break every day, so I walk pretty far along the sea wall and feel super refreshed when I get back to my desk. $5 3:30 p.m. — Off work. I get home and am greeted by my happy fat little wolves. My BF is still here, surprisingly, as he's usually out when it's nice. He's a pro-athlete, so his schedule is very flexible. He goes on two week-long filming trips at least once a month, so the dogs are very happy when he's around and so am I. His main source of income is from his sponsors and odd jobs he picks up from his friends. We decide to go for a bike ride to the beach before the rain hits us again. 6 p.m. — When we get back, we feed the dogs and take them out to pee. We're super hungry, so we decide to order a pizza: thin crust with cream sauce, arugula, mushrooms, and red onions. I pop open a bottle of red and have a glass while my BF has a beer from the fridge. We settle in for the night, rewatching . $25 9:30 p.m. — Because I wake up so early everyday, I have a weeknight bedtime of 10 p.m. I brush my teeth, change into sweats, and do my nightly beauty routine: Amorepacific Enzyme Peel, Eve Lom Cleanser, The Ordinary Lactic Acid and Hyaluronic Acid, and GlamGlow Dreamduo Overnight Treatment. Daily Total: $30",1,24
"6:30 a.m. — Same ol' routine, except today I'm wearing Adidas track pants. You know those memes that are like: ""Me at work vs. Me on the weekend?"" I am that girl. I look like shit during the week and then turn up on the weekends. I'm constantly told I look different outside of work. Who am I trying to impress in front of my computer? NOBODY. Pair up my track pants with my Timbs and my Alpha bomber jacket, and I'm out the door feelin' great. 12:30 p.m. — Meetings all morning. I swear our meeting room is nap-inducing. Spent the entire meeting trying to keep my eyes open and thinking: ""This all could have just been sent in an email."" I've been with this company for seven years now, and I'm really good at my job, but I'm getting super bored of it. I actually went on a few interviews a few months ago and got an offer from a company I was really excited about, but when I went to quit my job...my company basically said no and that they'd give me whatever the other company was offering and change my job title if I stayed. I stayed. I can't really complain, because I'm so comfortable here and I love everyone I work with. But the challenge just isn't there. 3:30 p.m. — Off work! It's raining, so it's going to be a lazy night I'm sure. My BF has a bunch of friends over when I get home, and the dogs are right in the middle of it just loving all the attention. There are constantly guys over, which I don't mind at all. They're all so nice and I'm kinda like their mom. I ask if they've been eating their veggies or if they just live off beer. They're watching skate videos, so I go into my room to watch and relax. 6:30 p.m. — The boys are hungry, so we venture over to a local pub a few blocks away. The BF and I share nachos and I get a cider. He pays. He pays anytime we go out, which evens out because he stays with me at my condo whenever he's in town. I know people might assume that he's a freeloader or whatever, but he has never taken advantage of me and is so grateful. Also, it's cool because if I ever need anything handy done, I have like 10 dudes I can hit up to come fix things. We're just one big family. 10 p.m. — We get home and the boys are still hanging out in the living room, so the lady dog and I go cuddle in bed and fall asleep to . Daily Total: $0",2,24
"6:30 a.m. — LOL, I wake up to two guys passed out on the dogs' memory foam beds in the living room. This is actually pretty normal around here...the dogs' beds are actually so comfy and each fits a full-sized adult (because the dogs are both 90 pounds). The maximum number of people I've had crashing at my place was 10 guys from the States when they came up to Canada for a trip. And oddly, even though I only have one bathroom, it actually wasn't that bad. A couple of them camped out on the patio. 7 a.m. — Make my two scrambled eggs and get to work on boring emails. 12:30 p.m. — Buy a ginger kombucha from the store, find an empty bench by the water, and sunbathe. $5 3:30 p.m. — The boys are out filming when I get home, so it's just me and the dogs. It's super nice out, so I text some friends to come over. I grab the bottle of wine I opened on Monday and a couple ciders from the fridge, and we bike down to the park by the water. It's so nice today! We laugh, gossip, and drink until the sun goes down. 6:30 p.m. — My BF comes to meet us at the park and says he's hungry, so the group of us bike to my favorite vegan place, Meet in Gastown. I get the hot ""chik'n"" ceasar salad, my BF gets chili fries, and we each get a snakebite (half beer and half cider). My BF pays. 8 p.m. — BF and I bike home and walk the pups. Then we get ready for bed and cuddle with the dogs while watching until we pass out. Daily Total: $5",3,24
"6:30 a.m. — I'm going snowboarding after work today with my friend, so I pack my gear up and put it in the car. 7 a.m. — I make two scrambled eggs and work on emails. 8 a.m. — Again, I forgot that the breakfast guy was coming today! So I get a second breakfast. It's a Mexican-themed egg dish. It's really good. I love Mexican food. 12:30 p.m. — BF and I are going to a wedding in Kelowna this weekend, so I decide to walk to the store to buy snacks for our trip and pick up chips, meats, cheeses, a case of grapefruit Perrier, and lots of fruits. $25 3:30 p.m. — Snowboard time!!! My friend meets me at the office and we take off from there. We drive over to Seymour Mountain, where we both have access passes. 6:30 p.m. — Snowboarding is so fun! We call it quits and go to the restaurant to get food and drinks. I order the beef dip with a salad and my friend gets butternut squash pasta. We both get beers too. She pays for us both because I drove. 8 p.m. — I'm home and the BF is watching with the dogs. He's already walked and fed them, so I relax with him and tell him about my mountain time. I've been snowboarding since I was five years old, so it's a huge part of my life. I go around three times a week, mostly on weekends, and make frequent trips to Whistler. Daily Total: $25",4,24
"8 a.m. — My dad flew in from Texas this morning to watch the dogs while we're at the wedding this weekend. He jumps at every chance he gets to come spend time with his fur grandbabies. He legit loves them more than me, I think. We go get pho with my dad. Mmm. My BF pays for me. 10 a.m. — My BF and I say goodbye to the fur babies and my dad, and then we hit the road. It's about a four-hour drive, but we want to get there a little early to get unpacked and checked in. BF pays for the first gas fill-up. 12 p.m. — I have to pee, and I want Subway, so we stop and I get a turkey foot-long with two cookies. $10 2:30 p.m. — Okay, so weirdly, Vancouver has NO Taco Bells. Growing up in California, I used to get Taco Bell ALL the time, so every time I go somewhere with a Taco Bell, I have to have it. I order a beef Taco Supreme, a Nachos Supreme with LOTS of extra hot sauce, and a Mountain Dew, and my BF gets the Doritos Taco Supreme. He pays because he thinks it's cute that I have this weird obsession with Taco Bell. 3 p.m. — We get to Kelowna and stop at a liquor store to stock up. I get so much booze — and am ready to party! I buy ciders, sparkling vodka drinks, a bottle of red wine, and tequila. My BF gets a 15-pack of beer. I pay. $82 4 p.m. — We're checked in and our fridge is stocked! I see one of my best friends who came from Alberta, and we're instantly ready to start drinking. We literally don't even have to greet each other — it's just: ""DRINK?"" ""DRINK!"" We head to the park with our cooler and hang out while we wait for the other guests to start rolling in. It's so nice out today! It's kind of a sausage fest at this point, but I have one lady friend with me, which is all I need. My best friend from California is coming later tonight. I'm stoked! 8 p.m. — We go back to the hotel after it starts getting dark, and my friend and I have a dance party to the new Cardi B album. Did you guys watch ?! I did. It's like I watched Cardi grow up! #Proud. We go next door to join the boys and wait for our Cali pals to roll through. 10 p.m. — Okay so...apparently I'm still on my weeknight sleep schedule and I drank too much. I pass out at 10 p.m. while the party continues until 4 a.m. next door. Oops. Daily Total: $92",5,24
"10 a.m. — Wake up SO thirsty. Good thing I bought those grapefruit Perriers. I sip on one and gently wake up the BF, trying to gauge how hungover he is. For having stayed up until 4 a.m., he's feeling surprisingly good! Thank god, because I always wake up starving after drinking. 10:30 a.m. — We walk over to Denny's and I get a Grand Slam with bacon, hash browns, scrambled eggs, and sausage. BF gets an omelette. He pays. 12 p.m. — Cali girlfriend comes up and we start getting ready for the ceremony. We look fireee!!! We head to the golf course and sure enough...there's an open bar...so we start drinking! The bride and groom are party animals, so this wedding is about to be lit. The bride looks so pretty! 3 p.m. — We're all back at our hotels, so everyone starts drinking again while we wait for the reception to start in three hours. We go to the pool with our drinks and hang out in the hot tub for an hour before we bring the hotel party back to our room. 6 p.m. — We take a cab to the reception hall, and my friend pays. We all laugh and cry and then drink some more. The bride is one of my best friends, and she loves The Eagles and really wants to see them live, so I decide to buy us tickets to their show as part of my gift to her. My BF and I already gave the couple cash for their wedding gift, but I want to do a little extra for her. I confirm that she hasn't bought her own tickets yet and buy two resale tickets for us on my phone. She is going to die from happiness. That's worth the price tag and the hours of boredom I'm going to have to endure during the show. $350 12 a.m. — Reception is over and we've all danced harder than anyone has every danced, I think. My legs are going to be real sore from all the stomping we did during ""Cotton Eye Joe."" We all head back to the hotel and keep the party going. 1:30 a.m. — I've hit my wall and pass out at 1:30 a.m. Daily Total: $350",6,24
"8 a.m. — I'm up early and surprisingly not hungover, but I am hungry! I decide not to bother the BF, because he was probably up until 4 a.m. again. I go to the hotel restaurant and order us biscuits with sausage gravy. I eat mine alone in the restaurant and bring his up to surprise him. He's so grateful when he sees the food. 10:30 a.m. — We hang out and chill for a couple hours until it's time to pack up and check out. 11 a.m. — We're back on the road! Our friends from Cali are spending the night at our place before they continue on their journey home. We fill up the tank, and I pay this time. Gas is so much cheaper in Kelowna! $55 3:30 p.m. — I sleep for most of the trip, but my BF wakes me up when he spots a Taco Bell 45 minutes outside of Vancouver and asks if I want to stop. I say: ""YES!"" I literally don't understand this obsession either, but it's in me. I get the same thing as last time, beef Supreme Taco with Nacho Supreme, and my BF gets the Dorito Supreme with LOTS of extra hot sauce. 4:30 p.m. — We're home with the puppies and hanging out with my dad. My dad tells me that the dogs are out of kibble, so I go out to the pet store to buy some. Dog food is 25% off right now, so I grab two bags. $160 6:30 p.m. — Our Cali friends roll up and say they're dying to get poutine, so we walk up the street for poutine with my dad. I get a small classic poutine and my BF gets a classic poutine with a hot dog. BF pays. 10 p.m. — We're all beat from this weekend, so we smoke a joint, and my Cali friend and I do a GlamGlow face mask and watch before I pass out. Can't believe I have to work tomorrow — but it was a great weekend! Daily Total: $215",7,24
"10:45 a.m. — I wake up from a wonderful night's sleep, which makes me very happy, since I didn't sleep well two nights ago. Today's the Boston Marathon! I check my phone and see a text from my friend, L., asking if I want to get brunch. Sounds great, but I turn her down since I have food that needs to get eaten before it goes bad. We make plans to still meet up and watch the marathon — L. and I live two minutes from each other, which makes impromptu plans sooo easy. I eat blueberries and Greek yogurt while chatting with my roommate, K., who's working from home. I make coffee to bring with me to the marathon, and add some hot chocolate mix and Kahlua to it for extra excitement. 1 p.m. — After cheering on the impressive runners for an hour, we can't feel our toes, so L. and I walk/jog back home, feeling inspired! I eat a hardboiled egg, baby carrots, celery with peanut butter, and two crumpets with butter and Trader Joe's Everything But the Bagel Seasoning. (This seasoning is one of my proudest TJ's discoveries and I love sharing it with anyone who appreciates everything bagels.) 5 p.m. — I am feeling MEH. It seems to be a combination of antsy and apathetic. I'm thinking it's related to a dude situation: I had been amped for a recent date, but it didn't go quite as I had daydreamed. We still had a good time and got brunch in the morning, but for some reason, I didn't feel as *swoon-y* as I did after our first few dates. I try to take care of beginning of week activities to feel productive and positive…but it's not working. I realize I have a decent amount going on this week and may not make it to any of my favorite workout classes. I text my friend S. about going shopping tomorrow to find dresses for a school social event coming up this weekend. Then I get wishy-washy and wonder if I should go to yoga instead. I putz around my apartment a bit, tidying up and planning a couple of outfits for the week. For dinner, I mix barley I've already cooked with TJ's Tomato & Roasted Red Pepper Soup.

"7:30 a.m. — Wake up, shower, have chocolate almond milk and blueberries, and get ready for the day. 9 a.m — I drive to my doctor's office because I need tests done so that I can volunteer at a hospital. I easily find street parking, which makes me happy ($1.50). $1.50 10 a.m. — Afterwards, I treat myself to coffee ($5.30) because I'm proud of how reasonable I've become about blood work. Two years ago it freaked me out so much, and now I trust that the technicians clearly know what they're doing. Plenty of people get their blood drawn every day and survive. $5.30 10:30 a.m. — Can't find parking for a while at work, but remind myself to chill because my boss is quite understanding of people needing to attend to personal things like doctor's appointments. I'll get to work soon enough and take care of what needs to get done. 12:30 p.m. — I finish some QA testing that I've been working on with developers for more than a month. It's exciting to finally wrap it up! I get a seltzer and a bag of Chex Mix from the free office snack collection to celebrate, and then move on to the next project. 2:30 p.m. — For lunch, I heat up an Annie's Broccoli & Cheddar Bake Bowl that I put in the work freezer last week. I'm still feeling meh and in such a funk, with little energy to be productive. I'm not sure what's going, but I try to sing “Just one of them days, don't take it personal” in my head to remind myself that this happens once in a while and it'll be temporary. I text S., one of my best friends, about shopping and continue to be indecisive, but offer to pick up salads from Sweetgreen if we decide to meet up. She says: ""Let's do it!"" 6 p.m. — I pick up the salads and she Venmos me for hers before I can even object and tell her it's my treat. We meet at her place and sip grapefruit rosé that's funky at first but then gets really tasty. $10 7:30 p.m. — We go to the mall but don't find any dresses that are sexy enough and within our budgets. As we're about to leave, I find an amazing Free People skirt and a fun jacket on ridiculous sale, so I buy them both. I might return the jacket, though, because it's metallic and gives off a bit of an intergalactic vibe. $38.89 10 p.m. — I'm home, and so glad we saw each other. I don't get to see S. as much since she moved back home last fall (an hour away from where I live) and we're both busy with school. I feel so much better after seeing her. 10:30 p.m. — I go online to see if I can find the amazing Free People skirt in another size/color. The one I bought is blue and a bit big. I know it comes in a beautiful pink — but the store didn't have it in my size. I find the skirt online (still on sale, but not as inexpensive) and buy it in two sizes since I'm not sure what my size is, along with a pair of pants to get free shipping. I plan to return at least one of the skirts. I'm a return queen. $91.59 Daily Total: $147.28",2,25
"8 a.m. — Wake up after many snoozes, quickly rinse off (I sweat intensely at night) and get dressed for work. I eat a cup of blackberries while putting on makeup, and then drive to work. 9:10 a.m. — I do my usual morning routine: check emails while drinking coffee and eating a crunchy granola bar, both compliments of my office. 12:30 p.m. — Head out for my lunch break to continue the search for a dress for the weekend event. I check out a consignment store and TJMaxx, but don't find anything I like. I'm hungry, so I stop by Whole Foods and get an everything bagel, Fiji tuna salad, and a container of sprouts (because I recently saw a picture of a veggie sandwich on Pinterest with sprouts and it looked nice). Interesting combination of flavors, but it turns out pretty good and I'm really full! $7.05 5:30 p.m. — After working on ongoing projects, it's time for the work day to be over, and I head to therapy! I started with this therapist about two months ago and found out last week that she's being relocated, which is a bummer, because I've really enjoyed her therapeutic style. Seems like I'll be paired with another therapist for future sessions. I normally pay with my FSA debit card, but I misplaced it this week, so I pay the copay with another card. $25 6:45 p.m. — I catch up with my roommate and heat up a mug of barley and tomato roasted red pepper soup to have with wine for dinner. Then I explore my closet and try on combinations of dresses and heels that I already own to see if there's anything I can make work for this weekend. I have a decent option, but still want to find something fun if possible before Saturday. I spend the rest of the night browsing random things on the Internet before going to bed around 10:30.

"7:45 a.m. — I wake up after many snoozes, quickly shower, and get dressed for work. I braided my hair last night before bed so that it'd be crimpy today, which I like doing once in a while to switch up my look with minimal effort. I eat a few blackberries and throw sad carrots and a wrinkly red pepper in my bag and drive to work. 9:10 a.m. — I check emails while drinking coffee and eating the usual crunchy granola bar. Notice a few texts from someone I went on a couple of dates with last month; I'd thought things were done! Hmmm... 11 a.m. — I have a bit of a stressful morning meeting. I need to come up with crafty, more automated solutions for a colleague to lessen her workload. I have a seltzer and bag of Chex Mix (courtesy of my office kitchen) after the meeting to get energized to work on the project. 12 p.m. — I find out that we're ordering lunch in! This happens at least every other week, and I'm always grateful when it does. I get a Greek salad with tuna. I usually try not to eat too much tuna, but I'm a pescatarian, so my lunch options with protein from the places we mostly order from are limited . I really enjoy eating lunch with a few of my coworkers — on some days, work drags me down, but on other days, like today, I laugh so hard that my stomach hurts. 1:30 p.m. — I head back to the hospital for a follow-up read from Tuesday. I again find parking relatively easily and pay the meter. After my appointment, I speed-walk through a store across the street because I still have 10 minutes left on the meter. I look through their dress selection quickly, but don't find anything exciting. $1 2:15 p.m. — I have class tonight and realize on my drive back to work that an afternoon coffee sounds pretty ideal. I try a new-to-me iced coffee flavor that's nice enough. $2.35 4:30 p.m. — I head to class. I work at the university where I take classes, and receive tuition remission as a benefit. I would not be able to afford school right now if it weren't for this benefit. Whenever I hear people questioning how to finance their higher education, I suggest that they check out whether they can work at the school. The degree I'm working on now would cost $120,000 in credits. The part-time route is taking me longer than it would an average student, but the time sacrifice feels very much worth it to me. 6:30 p.m. — After class, I swing by AutoZone to buy gas-line antifreeze ($4.24). I talked to my dad the other night about proactive care for my car, and he recommended this (and a few other things) since I drive short distances regularly. I fill up my tank at a gas station down the street ($33.65). I really don't have as intense as of need for my car as I did with my work/school/internship schedule last year, but I still drive almost every day for work and errands. Even though I live in a city with decent public transportation, I really cherish the freedom and alone time that I get from having a car. $37.89 7 p.m. — I go to Trader Joe's and buy bread, yogurt, goat cheese, masala simmer sauce, figs, frozen naan, carrots, cucumbers, broccoli, blackberries, an onion, and Dark Chocolate Orange Sticks. $30.88 7:45 p.m. — When I get home, I'm not super hungry, but I have a feeling I won't want a full dinner later, so I blend frozen bananas and almond butter to make a bowl of imitation ice cream to eat. I cook a bunch of lentils and wild rice and add masala simmer sauce, which I then divide into leftover containers. Woohoo — lunches and dinners for the next few days! My rice usually turns out super mushy, but I found a tip online to cook it more like pasta, with excess water that you drain once the texture is right, and it turns out great. 8:30 p.m. — I Venmo my dad because I asked him to pick up flowers from me for his wife's birthday yesterday. Seemed like a better idea than ordering flowers online to be delivered (they live in Texas). He was happy to help and she loved them! $20 9 p.m. — Check in on work emails and Craigslist. I'm trying to find a new place to live for this coming September. My roommate got into business school in California, so she's moving there at the end of the summer. I'm hoping to find a perfect spot that's convenient for the different directions I'll be going in next year (for work and school) with fun roommates. I'll feel like I won the lottery if I find a place with a washer and dryer in-unit too. Boston can be a tricky and competitive place to find apartments, so I'm stalking housing posts to find myself a gem. 10 p.m. — I get ready for bed. I'm aiming to get some quality Zzzs tonight. Daily Total: $92.12",4,25
"7:30 a.m. — Wake up and shower. I eat toast with Everything But The Bagel seasoning, blackberries, and Dark Chocolate Orange Sticks while putting together a lunchbox. Then I put dry shampoo in my hair and and get dressed while jamming out to Lizzo before driving to work. 9 a.m. — Go through emails and drink the office coffee. 12 p.m. — Tea, carrots, and Chex Mix break. Have to turn down an invite from S. to get lunch, even though it sounds like a dream to get burritos and sit outside. 2 p.m. — I've made great progress on the tricky project from yesterday! I go outside for a quick walk to get fresh air and a few sun beams on my face. I warm my lentils and rice and get back to work. 6 p.m. — I'm taking a weekend seminar class that meets a couple of times each semester, and this is our final weekend meeting for the spring! The professor gives us a couple of short breaks and doesn't mind people eating during class. I enjoy my sprout, goat cheese, and cucumber sandwich and catch up with classmates who I haven't seen in a month. 8:30 p.m. — Home finally! Eat more Dark Chocolate Orange sticks with lime tortilla chips and enjoy rosé while trying to decide on a Netflix comedy to watch. Can't find anything I'm in the mood for, so I go to bed by 9:30 p.m. Daily Total: $0",5,25
"7:30 a.m. — I take a shower, make a quick lunchbox and coffee, and drive to class. 9 a.m. — It's an odd feeling being at school early on a Saturday morning! But I like this schedule better than meeting every week at night. The professor is amazing, as a teacher and as a human — he brings us bagels on Saturday mornings, so I enjoy an everything bagel with veggie cream cheese. 12 p.m. — We get a lunch break and I eat carrots, yogurt, cherries, and a sprout, goat cheese, and cucumber sandwich again. 3 p.m. — After class, I stop by HomeGoods for a couple of things but realize that I don't have my wallet on me — definitely a reliable money-saving tactic! 3:30 p.m. — I take a walk to my public library to pickup a book my therapist recommended last week. Turns out I put the book on hold at another location by mistake! Decide to keep the walk going and call my mom to see how she's doing. It's so glorious outside, and I'm pumped after catching up with her. I have an email offer for 50% off a coffee at a nearby coffee shop, and have a small amount of money left in credit at the place, so I get an afternoon pick-me-up. I leave a dollar in the tip jar, because the guys behind the counter are very cheery. $1.35 6 p.m. — S. comes over to get ready for the school social event and we order takeout sushi from down the street. I have $10 off from Grubhub. We order seaweed salad, two substantial sushi rolls, and miso soup. S. brought over wine, so we have ourselves a lovely little dinner. We catch up and do our traditional jam out to ""Can't Stop The Feeling!"" by JT while realizing that our outfits match in a hilarious way. $18.36 8:45 p.m. — We head to the event downtown. S. gets the a Lyft Line ($12) there. The event turns out to be super fun, and includes free drink tickets! 12 a.m. — After a few hours of dancing, we need to change shoes. I get us a Lyft back to my neighborhood and text L. to see if she wants to meet up with us and continue the night. $21.78 12:15 a.m. — We're considering a few different spots, and decide on a dive bar with food. We each get a sour and share sweet potato tots and pretzels. I put the food and my drink on my card while S. leaves a cash tip. $31.57 Daily Total: $73.06",6,25
"10 a.m. — S. and I walk to a wonderful donut shop down the street. It's finally nice outside, and it's amazing. We run into a friend of a friend and have our donuts and coffee with him at an outside table — life is a dream. It's a pricey spot for just a coffee and donut, but we haven't been since last summer, so I enjoy the luxury. $7.96 1 p.m. — I drive to meet up with friends from college at a trendy lunch spot on the other side of town that I rarely get to. It's nice to see them, but it's also a helpful reminder of why I don't see them more often. (I don't leave lunch feeling that great about myself.) But the black bean sandwich I got was delicious! $18.16 3 p.m. — I'm feeling inspired by the amazing weather, and go to a garden store that I've been meaning to check out. My sister and I recently traveled to the Netherlands and stayed with an adorable Dutch couple at a bed and breakfast. They had a “string of pearls” plant in their kitchen that was also adorable, so I buy a plant like it to remind me of them and the time we spent there. $21.23 6 p.m. — I'm sore from dancing and drinking. One of my favorite instructors teaches a Sunday evening restorative yoga class about a mile from my apartment, and it's wonderful. I use ClassPass credits to take it. It's a perfect way to wrap up the weekend. 8 p.m. — By the time I walk back from class, I'm pretty hungry, so I have rice with tomato and red pepper soup and a couple of dark chocolate peanut butter cups. I lay down on the couch and check out social media and random articles. I eventually get off the couch to shower and get to bed around 11 p.m. Daily Total: $47.35",7,25
"9 a.m. — I get to work just in time for the start of my Monday morning meeting. These meetings are pretty much a waste of my time, but we get catered breakfast, which makes it worth it. I make myself half of an everything bagel with peanut butter and an espresso. I prefer coffee, but my office doesn't have a drip coffee maker. 1 p.m. — I'm dying to take a little lunchtime walk, but I'm too busy to leave my desk. 3 p.m. — I didn't pack my lunch today, but I'm not super hungry and I don't have a lot of time, so I get an iced coffee from a nearby café. $3.21 5 p.m.. — My office kitchen stocks tons of snacks, so I grab a bag of popcorn and try to get a difficult code enigma figured out. 6 p.m. — I take the subway to my therapy appointment. I have time to spare, so I stop by a boutique and pick up a pretty black blouse and bralette ($41). I also stop by the ATM to take out a month's worth of therapy co-pays. I'm not insured through my workplace, but through some weird exception, my work funded a $750 HSA account for me. I withdraw the money from that account ($160). $41 8 p.m. — I leave my therapist's office and go to Whole Foods. This is a weekly ritual for me. I love grocery shopping — it feels like an extension of my therapy session. I get a green bell pepper, Persian cucumbers, grape tomatoes, a yellow onion, chickpeas, black beans, tempeh, vegan chick'n nuggets, a frozen burrito, and almond milk. $28 9:30 p.m. — I shower, change into comfy clothes, and start cooking up some cauliflower kimchi fried rice and a chopped vegetable side salad. I was planning on packing the leftovers for lunch tomorrow, but end up eating everything. I go back into the kitchen to cook another serving for tomorrow. 11 p.m. — I get into bed with my book and fall asleep soon after. Daily Total: $72.21",1,26
"8:15 a.m. — It's impossible for me to wake up earlier than I absolutely need to, so most mornings I end up getting out of bed at the last possible second and frantically getting ready. I go through my routine and then remember that I need to do my makeup because I have a date later tonight. I don't wear makeup every day, but I make an effort if I have social plans after work. I contemplate taking my makeup bag to work and doing it there, but decide to do it now and be a few minutes late instead. 9:10 a.m. — Not too late to work, fortunately. I make myself an espresso and eat half a bagel with peanut butter from yesterday's leftovers. 1 p.m. — I eat my desk lunch of kimchi fried cauliflower rice and salad. 3 p.m. — I'm feeling restless, so I go across the street to get a coffee and a chocolate croissant. I sit by the window and people watch for a little while. $5.38 6:15 p.m. — A guy I've been seeing for the past couple months, D., picks me up from my office to take me to dinner. I've felt somewhat ambivalent about this guy since I've met him. We have an amazing emotional connection, but I don't feel intense physical chemistry. I find myself comparing him to my ex a lot, which sucks. We walk to a cute Thai restaurant, where we each get a glass of white wine and share a julienne salad, edamame dip with wonton chips, and spicy vegetable tofu green curry. Everything is delicious. He offers to pay, but I insist that we split. $23.14 8 p.m. — We take the subway back to his place. The only dessert he has is a half a cookie left in the freezer, so he puts it on a frying pan to heat it up for me while I shower. 8:30 p.m. — I spend 15 minutes on the phone with my dad. I haven't talked to him in a couple months. Our conversation feels a little forced, but it's nice to catch up. 9 p.m. — D. and I cuddle in bed with our books. I'm not a huge fan of watching TV or movies in the evening. I spend my whole day in front of a computer, and a lot of time intermittently on my phone answering texts and emails. It's just too much screen time for me. I try to read my book, but we end up talking for most of the night until we fall asleep. Daily Total: $28.52",2,26
"8 a.m. — I drag myself out of bed. I don't sleep well sharing a bed with someone, and I am usually crabby in the morning. Not a good combination, but somehow D. finds my bad attitude charming. I borrow a sweater from his closet so I'm not wearing the exact same clothes as yesterday. D. walks me to the train station, and on our way through the park, we stop to admire the feral cats that live there. I love the cats, and love how D. always indulges in this habit with me. 9 a.m. — Arrive at the office and make myself some espresso. 10:30 a.m. — Feeling peckish, so I eat some pita chips and hummus from the office kitchen. 12:30 p.m. — I walk to The Strand to pick up a book I've been wanting to read: by Ari Shavit. They have a used copy available, so I choose that over a new edition. I also wanted to get by Åsne Seierstad, but they don't have it in stock. $9.25 1 p.m. — I get Indian food for lunch: a bowl with brown rice, chana masala, and saag paneer, plus a small samosa. $8 3 p.m. — I check the Mint app on my phone and see that my tax refund has arrived! $1,490! I tell myself I should treat myself to a designer bag I want, but I know I probably won't. I don't like making big purchases, but I generally let myself indulge in smaller treats throughout the month. 4 p.m. — I cancel a drinks date I had scheduled tonight. I've been out with this guy, J., twice. He's great on paper, but I'm just not crazy about him. When I met my ex, I was instantly enamored, and I guess I'm waiting for that feeling again. There's a free classical music concert tonight that I want to go to, and I contemplate inviting him, but decide I'd rather go alone. 9:30 p.m. — The concert was amazing. So nice to close my eyes and focus on the beautiful music. I donate $5 to the nonprofit that organized the event. Via is having a promotion where they're offering rides for $2.95, so I call a car home and tip the driver a couple of extra dollars. $10 10 p.m. — I snack on a hard boiled egg, two pieces of toast with goat cheese, and a couple cookies with a glass of almond milk. 11:30 p.m. — Not sure where the rest of the evening went. I talk on the phone with D. for a few minutes before falling asleep. Daily Total: $27.25",3,26
"8:25 a.m. — Barely drag myself out of bed. Why does no amount of sleep ever feel like enough? 9:15 a.m. — Roll into work late. I'm pretty emotionally checked out of this job. I've been here for a year and a half and plan on leaving soon to freelance for the summer. My boss is insufferable. We sit next to each other, and he has literally clipped his nails under his desk while sitting two feet away from me before, among other infractions. I also recently found out that one of my male colleagues makes significantly more than I do, despite doing the same job and having similar qualifications as me. It's left me feeling bitter, and consequently, I've felt no guilt about coming to work late or taking long lunch breaks. I make an espresso and eat an ezekiel bread English muffin with peanut butter that I brought from home. 12:30 p.m. — I walk to Muji to look for a housewarming gift for a colleague. I peruse for a while but don't find anything. Then I take a walk around the neighborhood and return to my desk to eat the veggie burger and salad I packed for lunch. 3 p.m. — A colleague and I go across the street to get coffee, and the barista tells me it's on the house! 6 p.m. — On my way out of work, I take out cash from an ATM for my cleaning lady who is coming tomorrow ($60). She cleans for me every other week. It's a pretty unnecessary luxury considering I live in a studio and am generally pretty neat, but cleaning makes me anxious and it's so nice never having to deep clean. I've been thinking about ending our arrangement and cleaning myself, but my cleaning lady is the sweetest, most hardworking woman and I feel terrible taking away one of her income sources. 7 p.m. — After changing and doing my makeup at home, I meet J. for dinner at a Vietnamese place near me. He was very gracious after I cancelled last minute yesterday, so I go despite not feeling very excited about the date. I have a huge bowl of spicy curry veggies with brown rice. J. pays. 9 p.m. — We walk over to a nearby bar and spend the evening flirting, playing chess, and drinking. He pays again. 11 p.m. — J. walks me home and we make out on the street for a while. It was a nice date, but once I'm back in my apartment, all I can think about is my ex. I'm still pretty tipsy, so I put on ""Nothing Compares 2 U"" by Sinéad O'Connor on repeat and wonder if my ex is feeling the same way. Daily Total: $0",4,26
"8:30 a.m. — Aren't I too young to have such a bad hangover for drinking this little?? I text my boss to let him know I'll be late. 9:25 a.m. — I get to work, make myself an espresso, and chug a couple glasses of water. 12 p.m. — My work caters lunch one day a week, so I fill my plate with coconut brown rice, mashed sweet potatoes, and roasted veggies. 1 p.m. — I walk over to The Strand, and they have in stock today! I buy it. Next I walk to my optometrist's office to pick up a six-month supply of contact lenses. I payed for it with my HSA last week. $14.50 5 p.m. — I leave work and take the train to Times Square to try to get discounted Broadway tickets for myself and a friend. Unfortunately, there are no affordable tickets left for the shows we wanted to see. I call her to break the news, and we decide to meet at an Italian restaurant instead. 8 p.m. — My friend and I each get a pizza and also split a burrata and beet salad and a bottle of rosé prosecco. The food is divine, and I end up a little drunk. $43.55 10 p.m. — I take a cab home. While I was at work, my cleaning lady came, and my apartment is spotless. I shower, snuggle up in my freshly washed sheets, and fall asleep to an episode of  $12.87 Daily Total: $70.92",5,26
"9 a.m. — I wake up hungover, take some ibuprofen, and lay in bed for an hour. 10 a.m. — I get coffee from a coffee cart on my block for $1.25. I sip slowly and walk to Lululemon to exchange a pair of leggings D. got me as a gift. He's a thoughtful gift giver and I really appreciate the gesture, but I hate the print he picked out. I didn't have the heart to tell him that, so I feigned enthusiasm. He left me with a gift receipt, so despite feeling guilty, I exchange them for a more sensible navy blue color. The sales lady somehow convinced me to exchange my $98 pair for an even more expensive pair, so I end up paying the difference ($43). Afterwards, I go to Madewell and pick up a blouse that makes me excited for spring ($44). $88.25 12 p.m. — Back at my apartment, I eat an apple with peanut butter while I pack a small weekend bag. I'm going to be dog-sitting for a family member for a couple of days. When I arrive at their place, I see they left me $80! 2 p.m. — I've had such a lazy afternoon. I still have a bit of a headache, so I've just been dozing on the couch and browsing the Internet. I answer a few emails that I've been meaning to get to and help myself to a bagel I find in the freezer, as well as some Mallomars from the cabinet. 4:30 p.m. — I walk to a nearby florist to get a last minute gift for my colleague's housewarming party tonight. I pick out a gorgeous orchid without asking how much it costs first. The total is $38, and I know I could have gotten the same thing for half the cost at Whole Foods, but I console myself by telling myself that it's good to support local businesses. $38 7 p.m. — After feeding and walking the dog, I grab a bottle of wine from the fridge (I was given permission!) and take the subway to Brooklyn. The journey takes about an hour in total, and I get lost in my book. 11:30 p.m. — I leave the housewarming party. It was low-key, and I had a great time. My colleague's girlfriend made delicious tofu sliders just for me because she knows I'm a vegetarian, which was such a lovely gesture. I take the train back to Manhattan and call D. to see if he wants to meet up at the apartment where I'm dog-sitting. He arrives not long after I do, and we catch up and cuddle with the dog before falling asleep. Daily Total: $126.25",6,26
"9:30 a.m. — Sharing a bed with D. and the dog left me with way too little space and blanket last night. I barely slept. D. and I take the dog for a walk and then I make us bagels and coffee. 11 a.m. — We go to the park and sit in the sun for a while. The dog has anxiety issues, so she doesn't come with us. :( 2 p.m. — I feed the dog and take her for a walk. Then I hop on the train to go to my friend's apartment in Queens. The trip takes forever, but I remembered to bring my books, so I get some quality reading time in. I arrive at my friend's apartment just as she's taking lemon poppy cookies out of the oven. We eat a few and then walk over to the Noguchi Museum. It's a smallish museum featuring an amazing outdoor sculpture garden. It's my first time visiting, and I'm in love! 6 p.m. — On our way back to my friend's place, I stop at the Vietnamese café across the street to get a huge spicy tofu sandwich. $7.50 7 p.m. — I take the train back to feed the dog her dinner and go for another walk. I do some laundry (they have a washer and dryer in their apartment!) and clean up the place. Then I try on my new Lululemon leggings and immediately regret buying them. I plan on exchanging them again next weekend for a more reasonable pair. 8 p.m. — I'm hungry, so I go out and buy myself a small bag of potato chips and a Hershey bar with almonds. $3 10 p.m. — I end my night quietly, reading my book, cuddling with the dog, and falling asleep to an episode of Daily Total: $10.50",7,26
"6:24 a.m. — I wake up, panicked that my alarm didn't go off and I overslept. But I set it for 6:30 a.m., which is why it hasn't gone off yet. Good stuff. 7 a.m. — It takes me some time to roll out of bed. I brush my teeth, put my contacts in, moisturize, and pat on sunscreen. Then I fold up my duvet and futon padding, shove it into my closet, and fold up my futon and lean it against the wall. I put on my very best “I'm a serious teacher and an essential member of the office” outfit. 7:20 a.m. — I plunk down with a bowl of plain yogurt and tropical granola mix. This is my second week in a row of eating this breakfast, and it's gettin' old. Then I stumble out the door to take my 12-minute walk to work. 11 a.m. — After teaching a class and distributing lesson plans to my co-teachers, I finally get downtime at my desk to correct student work. I had my students write questions for me, since last week was my self-introduction lesson, and someone wrote: “Do you have a boyfriend?” 12:25 p.m. — I set up lunch trays for the students with the nutritionist and the groundskeeper. If there's anything that I'm proud of, it's gotta be my lunch set-up skills. It takes teamwork, coordination, and balance to get these 30-plus trays together, let me tell you. 12:40 p.m. — I grab a good-looking tray and take it to my desk to eat. (I get a monthly lunch bill for roughly $3 per lunch.) It's a slice of salmon baked in mayonnaise with seaweed stir-fry on the side, along with a bowl of rice and miso soup. I skip the milk. I don't know if it's age or the Japanese milk, but dairy and I have been having an ongoing feud lately. 4 p.m. — Out of work and off to the grocery store. I go in without a list and buy bread, bok choy, ham, potatoes, a discount steak, and baby crackers. $12.70 5:30 p.m. — Dinner is mashed potatoes and a few slices of thin-cut pork. 7 p.m. — I go to the English conversation group at the community center. Tonight, the group consists of a Japanese-born former Silicon Valley resident, an elementary school teacher, a retired ski instructor, and a Mormon missionary. We discuss traveling experiences and Japanese street signs. 10:40 p.m. — I text my friend, R., and boyfriend, J., for a bit, and then go to sleep. Daily Total: $12.70",1,27
"6:30 a.m. — I wake up with an awful ache in my jaw. For nearly two years I've been sleeping on a buckwheat pillow, and it's been decent until recently. Now I wake up sore from it. It really wrenched my jaw overnight. 7:30 a.m. — I tried to dry my laundry on the balcony too late in the day on Sunday, so my clothes are still damp two days later. Boo. Granola and yogurt breakfast again. I'm determined to finish the yogurt or else it's just gonna get moldy in my fridge. I head out the door a little early today but then get stuck behind a pair of slow-moving first-years. Such is life. 12:25 p.m. — It's DIY bibimbap day at school. I have stir-fried pork, spinach, and egg to put over rice, plus glass noodle soup and a small block of cheese for dessert. After lunch, R. texts me asking if I'd be willing to drop him and his roommate, M., off at the bus stop later in the evening. I say yes. 4 p.m. — I walk out of work and into a violent mist. I open my umbrella and it immediately turns inside out. Ugh, I don't even have a jacket. 6:30 p.m. — Steak, potatoes, and bok choy for dinner. The kitchen in this apartment has less than a foot of counter space and I've got one gas burner, no oven, and no microwave. I miss the kitchen I had when I lived in America. 9:40 p.m. — I pick up R. and M. from their apartment and take them to the bus station. They're off to Cambodia and Thailand for the long vacation week. I thought it would be better if I wore my glasses instead of my contacts for driving at night, but I was wrong. I can't actually see very well. Yikes. I resolve to get new glasses by the end of the week — I've been thinking about it for a few months now. Daily Total: $0",2,27
"7:30 a.m. — I finally finish the yogurt and granola! I'm feeling inspired and oddly determined to do a good job with team-teaching the third-year classes today. Maybe I'm delirious from the mediocre sleep, but I feel a rush of adrenaline. 7:55 a.m. — When I get to work, a bunch of third-years are waiting in front of the office, so I say good morning to them. Startled, they stand at attention and say it back. My co-teacher who sits near the door remarks that I don't look too energetic today. I laugh, defeated. I tried for energetic, but she saw right through me immediately! 12:45 p.m. — Lunch time. On some Thursdays, we get the lunch staff's ode to non-Japanese food. Today it's hot dog bun-like bread, breaded white fish, egg flower soup, and a cheese, cabbage, corn, and mayo salad. I know the cabbage is fresh because I saw heads of it get delivered to the kitchen by hand this morning. The nutritionist drops off my monthly lunch bill  ($38.70). I hand her an envelope of money and head home. 5:45 p.m. — R. texts me and we have a gif war. 8:30 p.m. — In the shower, I try to steam the wrinkle out of my shirt for tomorrow, but I just end up just drenching my shirt. Cool. 9:45 p.m. — I wind down by journaling while listening to Spotify's Chet Baker radio. I read through my entries from the past two years and get really sad because I forgot how emotionally demanding things have been in this time. Sometimes I worry about whether I'll look back on my time spent here and be satisfied with what I've done. Daily Total: $0",3,27
"7:35 a.m. — I make a real whopper of a grilled cheese sandwich. Four slices of ham and two slices of artificial cheese. I don't actually need that big of a breakfast, but here we are. The grilled cheese turns out fantastically, though. No regrets. 7:55 a.m. — I hit every single green light down the street to my elementary school. 'Tis an auspicious day. It's my first day at the elementary school for this school year, so I am feeling jazzed. 11:15 a.m. — I try to get a handle on how to team-teach with the new teachers. Sometimes, this job feels like a contortionist act. Flexibility and adaptability required. In the end, I realize that the students know the routine better than the new teachers do. We'll find our groove eventually. 12:30 p.m. — Lunchtime with the fifth graders. It's a pickled cabbage-based salad covered in dried plum flakes. There's a small slice of saba mackerel topped with sliced ginger and daikon, followed by pork miso soup and rice. 1 p.m. — At recess, the wild third graders are knee-deep in foliage. A kid shows me a lizard he put in a water bottle. The lizard has a bug on its head. ""Banana bug,"" the kid explains. I play tag with a swarm of little ones. We all run in circles in the damp sand, and then we go inside. I'm sweating all throughout clean-up time. 4:20 p.m. — I get home and take a nap. Then I get up and go to the convenience store to withdraw money from the ATM. If I withdraw money on a weekday before 6 p.m., I don't have to pay withdrawal fees. 6:30 p.m. — J. picks me up and we get conveyor belt sushi and noodles. Plus he gets a Coke and I order soy sauce butter fries. Yesss. He has a 5% off coupon, so we pay together and I hand him money to cover my half. $10.17 7:30 p.m. — We head to J.'s house and stop at 7-Eleven to get ice cream on the way. I didn't read the label well enough, so my ice cream has walnuts in it. I'm not down, so I give it to J. $0.91 8:20 p.m. — We stop off at another convenience store, where I grab aloe yogurt-flavored Fettuccine gummies. When we get to his place, we make Character Death Bingo cards to use for when we see tomorrow. $0.90 Daily Total: $11.98",4,27
"7:40 a.m. — Wake up. My sister texts me, asking for the name of this clip I showed her four months ago when I last saw her. 8:15 a.m. — J. and I hit the road. We have to go into the nearest big city because we want the subtitled version of , not the dubbed. Our local theater only shows the dubbed versions of Marvel movies most of the time. 9:20 a.m. — We make it into the city and buy tickets at the automatic kiosk ($16.49). Then we go down the road to McDonald's for breakfast, where I order a Crispy Chicken Muffin and an orange juice ($1.83). $18.32 12 p.m. — I'm sobbing during the end credits. 2 p.m. — We cross the street to go to a Pokemon Go raid in the park, where there are about 45 people gathered. Afterwards, we follow signs to a café to get lunch, but they only have gelato and coffee. When life gives you lemons…you get a single scoop of cookies and cream. $2.75 3 p.m. — We go to a buffet in the mall where the theater is. I load my plate up with French fries, mapo tofu, cod roe spaghetti, cold udon, potato croquettes, pizza, and a dessert waffle. J. won Character Death Bingo, so I pay for both of us. Showing my movie ticket gets me a discount. $29.10 7 p.m. — J. goes with his neighbor to watch at our local theater. I opt out and relax at home. Daily Total: $50.17",5,27
"7:30 a.m. — J. comes to my house and we drive to the mall so I can get new clothes as a late birthday present to myself. J. insists that we stop to fill up my gas tank first, even though I just gassed up a few days ago. He makes a good point that gas prices anywhere else will be much higher, though, so I get two and a half gallons of gas ($6.83). Then we grab a quick breakfast at 7-Eleven. I get an imposter Hot Pocket, which is essentially two hot dogs encased in cheese, meat sauce, and a tortilla ($2.20). Delicious. $9.03 9:45 a.m. — We take the freeway, and the toll is $16.40. We stop by the Picture Book Museum before getting lunch and heading to the mall. (Museum admission is $8.24.) $24.64 12:20 p.m. — Finding parking for lunch is actually the worst, but after looping around the streets three times over, we park at a soba restaurant. The wait list is 16 parties deep, so we settle for the curry place next door. We get curries, salad, naan, frozen yogurt, and tea. $13.74 1:30 p.m. — On the way to the mall, J. takes a turn at the sight of a store that says ""Chocolate Factory."" (He loves too much for his own good.) We're disappointed to find that they sell more chocolate rusks, which are glorified croutons, than they do actual pure chocolate. He gets a chocolate muffin and an ice cream cone, which he shares with me. 2:30 p.m. — It takes forever to get into the mall parking lot. We inch along, blasting Public Enemy from my car. When we finally FINALLY get a parking spot, the sheer density of the crowd is overwhelming. Since lunch was a little unfulfilling for us, we share a kebab from a kebab truck. $2.75 3 p.m. — Ever since I've lived here in this country, I've been trying to keep up with the dress code. High neck lines at all costs and long sleeves until it's too hot for it. I find a shirt and light dress pants that I like ($82.11), plus I finally get new glasses, for the first time in over six years ($79.14). $161.25 6 p.m. — We pass by a bakery window, and J.'s eyes bug out at the sight of muffins. We pick up two baked goods each ($4.58). Then we get dinner at a pizza place. I get a margarita pizza  ($16.70) and J. gets a pepperoni pizza — and we decide that it's the best pizza we've had in Japan! $21.28 7:40 p.m. — I pay for parking at a ticket kiosk. (Since I got the ticket validated, I get three hours of free parking.) J. gets a Starbucks coffee for the road, but I don't get anything since I don't drink coffee or tea. $2.75 10 p.m. — Tolls cost the same amount coming back as they did getting there ($16.40). We gas up when we get back into town ($20.15). J. covers both charges. Daily Total: $235.44",6,27
"8:30 a.m. — I wake up and crawl out of bed like a creature out of a Guillermo del Toro film. For breakfast, I eat the baked goods that I bought from the bakery yesterday. The day looks sunnier than the weather forecast said it would be, so I throw a load of laundry into the washing machine. It takes so much time to wait for the wash to finish, and then to hang up every piece of clothing outside. You never realize how many socks you have until you're clipping them up one-by-one. 11 a.m. — J. and I go to the multimedia rental store to rent , which costs $0.73. I pay for half of it ($0.37). We pick up fried chicken from a place down the street. I don't have a whole lot of coins on me, so I give J. a 1,000-yen bill that covers a little more than half ($9.16). We pretend not to notice that a toddler is twerking on the bench across from us. On the way home, I get a milk pudding and J. gets an ice cream sandwich and red bean dessert from 7-Eleven. J. pays for all of it. $9.53 12 p.m. — We eat the chicken with rice we made ahead of time and watch . 3 p.m. — J. heads home and I take a nap. I email my mom, updating her on my weekend. I've been away from my family for several years now, but this year I've started missing them and have decided it's time for me to move back home. 10:30 p.m. — Sleep. Daily Total: $9.53",7,27
"5:15 a.m. — Alarm goes off — ugh. I set it last night, hoping it would motivate me to go my boxing class. My boyfriend, M., and I went away this past weekend and had a late flight back, so I'm still recovering. I hit snooze and go back to bed. 6:30 a.m. — Pull myself out of bed and hop in the shower. My morning routine isn't too crazy. I shower, wash my face, put on makeup, and straighten my hair. I am moving slowly this morning, but decide I need to go to the gym, so I pack a bag that will work for yoga, spin, or whatever I decide. I'll check ClassPass later for classes. 7:15 a.m. — Scramble two eggs with bacon and goat cheese for my breakfast. Pack my lunch (leftovers from last night) and put a few dishes away from the dishwasher. Looking in the fridge, I realize I don't have coconut creamer, so I stop at Starbucks for a coffee on my way to work. 7:30 a.m. — Get an iced cold brew with coconut milk and sugar-free vanilla and begin my morning commute. It normally takes about 35 to 45 minutes in the morning and, for some reason, an hour on the way home. $3.45 8:05 a.m. — Head into work and realize my drink has spilled all over the inside of my work bag! Ugh, my Moleskin that I use for work meetings is completely soaked and so is my calendar book, check book, and laptop. I spend the next few minutes sopping up the mess. 8:30 a.m. — Luckily my laptop turns on — crisis sort of averted. I eat my breakfast while skimming my work emails and send a quick note to my nutritionist asking to reschedule my appointment for this coming Friday. I also send her my food journal. A few months ago, I was diagnosed with a rare autoimmune condition. As a result, I was put on several medications, including steroids. After a countless number of tests, the doctors still aren't able to figure out what happened. Luckily I am in remission now, but I am taking a lot of preventative measures to ensure I don't have a relapse, like seeing a nutritionist who specializes in folks with autoimmune diseases. I take several prescribed medications as well as a women's probiotic, Vitamin D, Vitamin B12 and a calcium supplement. 9 a.m. — M. sends me a snap of his new work screensaver, which is a picture of us taken this past weekend on a hike we did in Arizona together. I send him a sassy text back asking who bae is. He just learned what ""bae"" meant — so I know he will get a kick out of it. We have been together for 10 months and just did our first trip together — and we still like each other! 9:30 a.m. — My boss sends me a reminder to book my travel for an upcoming work conference we're heading to in June. I already booked the hotel but need to coordinate the flights. I glance at the flight options and make my selection (Southwest – gotta get the rewards!) and then make a mental note to tell my mom. She wants to tag along and explore the city while I work. 10:45 a.m. — Reading résumés and scheduling interviews has made me hungry. I grab a chocolate chip Rxbar and eat it while posting a new job. 11:40 a.m. — My boss swings into my office and asks me if I want to grab lunch. I tell him I have an interview in five minutes but will be done at 12:15 p.m. He has a meeting at 1 p.m., though, so we agree to reschedule later this week. 12:30 p.m. — Heat up my lunch of stuffed bell peppers. My sister and I cooked them last night and they are easily my favorite lunch to bring. I normally stuff them with spicy chicken sausage from Sprouts, add in whatever veggies we have, and put cheese on top. Yummy! I also eat fresh strawberries from my CSA subscription box. They're so sweet they taste like candy! 1:15 p.m. — My best friend sends a group text with the details and cost breakdown for the upcoming T. Swift concert we're going to. I paid for the tickets months ago, so now I just Venmo her for the hotel. $33 3 p.m. — Several fires to put out today, so I'm rescheduling candidates and figuring out the glitches in our processes and offer negotiations. I love my job since no day is ever the same, but everything always seems to hit at once. 4:15 p.m. — My calendar and Moleskin are still soggy, and my checkbook is definitely a goner. I decide to leave them in my office overnight, hoping they will dry out. I realize I left my gym shoes at home, so I make a detour to my house before my workout. 4:20 p.m. — My sister calls and lets me know that our Blue Apron box hasn't arrived (it was supposed to) and gives me a rundown of items we have in the fridge. I do most of the cooking and grocery shopping and was gone this past weekend, so I was counting on Blue Apron for dinner tonight. Based on the amount of veggies (thank you CSA box) and the protein we have in the freezer, I decide to skip the grocery store. 5:15 p.m. — Finally home — the commute was awful. I skim ClassPass to see what options I have and instead decide to sign up for a class tomorrow morning. Since I couldn't bring myself to go to the store and I need coconut creamer for coffee tomorrow, I text M. asking him to bring it, since he's coming over tonight. I skim the fridge and freezer and pull out frozen chicken breasts to defrost. Then I start to unload the dishwasher and realize there's water floating at the bottom. Ugh! Hoping it's a quick fix, I clean the grate, but it doesn't do the trick. I run the disposal thinking it's backed up, and still nothing. Finally, I crawl under the sink with a flashlight and check the water hose line, which also looks clean. I decide to unplug the dishwasher and hope it will reset itself. Voila. Once it's plugged back in, it drains. Thank goodness. I didn't want to call a plumber. 6 p.m. — With the dishwasher fixed and the chicken defrosting, I decide to do a quick 15-minute yoga video. I like Yoga by Candace and find her videos easy to follow along. My sister wakes up — she had an early day so she was napping when I got home, and we catch up while watching CNN. 6:30 p.m. — My sister decides to make spaghetti squash (which I don't like), so we both head to the kitchen and she cooks her meal while I work on the chicken. We bought an Instapot a year or so ago and I use it pretty often. The chicken is still a little frozen, but luckily they're cutlets, so they should be fine. I sauté the chicken in a mix of herbs and olive oil butter. Once the chicken is sautéed on both sides, I adjust the setting to pressure cooker on high for 20 minutes. 7 p.m. — Chicken is done. I heat up frozen brown rice , which I always have on hand, and leftover roasted veggies from last night. I throw it all together and add ponzu sauce. I love ponzu and am convinced it makes every meal better. While eating, I email Blue Apron and let them know the box was never delivered despite the tracking information confirming it had been. I had never used Blue Apron before but I received a promo code and decided to give it a shot. I am regretting the decision. Oh well! I hope whoever got my box is enjoying it. 7:45 p.m. — M. arrives with his rescue dog. He had a late day but still managed to pick up the coconut creamer. He picked up two — one for my house and one for his, since he knows I can't drink coffee black. We both grab a glass of wine and sit down with my sister to watch . We are terrible and none of us do well tonight. There was an entire category based on owls?! 8:15 p.m. — My sister heads to bed and I grab a second glass of wine and put on . 10:15 p.m. — M. leaves and I wash my face and head straight to bed. Daily Total: $36.45",1,28
"4:30 a.m. — Wide awake with a headache. Those two glasses of wine were a bad idea. I drink water and close my eyes for another 30 minutes. 5 a.m. — Alarm goes off — why do I this to myself? I snooze for five more minutes and throw on my gym clothes. Then I wake my sister up to come to the class with me. 5:30 a.m. — Checked in and I am surprised to see so many chipper people here. I am struggling to keep my eyes open. 6:20 a.m. — Whew! All done – I feel like I am going to throw up. We head back home, and I actually do throw up and am now really regretting that wine! While my sister is in the shower, I pack my lunch, eat a blood orange, and assemble my overnight bag, since I am staying at M.'s tonight. I hop in the shower, blow-dry my hair, and throw on my work clothes. 7:20 a.m. — I make my usual breakfast: two eggs, a piece of bacon, and goat cheese. I have cold brew in the fridge, so I put that in my to-go cup with creamer (obvi) and head out the door with all my bags. 8:10 a.m. — Sit at my desk, break out my breakfast, have a quick text exchange with M., and start to read through my emails. My boss lets me know he's working from home and thanks me for a bottle of wine I gave him at Christmas, which he just opened last night. I sent him a quick update on offers I have pending, and we agree to do our afternoon meeting via Webex. 11:45 a.m. — I'm starving, so I pull out my Justin's Chocolate Hazelnut pretzel pack. I scarf it down while organizing my candidate folders. 12:15 p.m. — I'm starving! I heat up my chicken, leftover brown rice, and roasted veggies. There's a line at the microwave, so I wait a few minutes for my turn, and then eat at my desk. I'm still hungry, so I eat what's left of my strawberries. 12:30 p.m. — Open my grapefruit La Croix and get back to work. My boss and I are meeting at 1 p.m. to go over the past quarter's results, and he needs an update on a critical role. When I wrote my goals for this year, he thought the metrics I put in were too aggressive, and was worried we wouldn't be able to hit them, but after pulling the data, we are more than on track, so I'm hoping for a big thumbs up! 2:20 p.m. — The meeting went well! He was very impressed. He asks me to make a few tweaks on my presentation for the leadership team meeting in a few weeks. This will be my first time presenting to the team as a whole, so I am excited. I started here about four months ago, and this is my first opportunity to show them the results of all the work we've been doing. We also talk about my development, and I get put on a larger project that my boss was going to tackle solo. Sweet! 3:45 p.m. — I call Blue Apron, since no one has responded to my email regarding my delivery. Apparently, it was delivered to the wrong address , so they refund my credit and add in an extra week. Based on this experience, I probably won't keep the service — grocery shopping is much more reliable. 4:20 p.m. — I am starving and didn't pack any afternoon snacks. I find raw almonds in my office drawer and grab a handful, plus two mini peanut butter cups from the candy bowl in the lobby. Then I hop on Amazon and order a four-pack of Dang Coconut Chips with a 50% off coupon. I choose the no-rush shipping option, so I get $1 in digital credit. $11.41 5:15 p.m. — I wrap up the last of my emails and pack up for the day. I send M. a quick text letting him know I'm heading his way. 6:15 p.m. — Schlep all my bags into M.'s place and we catch up for a minute before we head to sushi. Sushi is always a go-to for me, so I was happy when M. suggested it. We beat the dinner rush and get a table right away. We order two rolls to share, plus M. gets a spicy scallop hand roll, and I get a crispy rice appetizer. We split a large Sapporo. The music is really loud for some reason and we joke that we're in a nightclub since we can't hear each other. The bill comes and M. pays, since he claims its his turn. We try to keep things pretty even, so we take turns paying for dinner/activities. 7:30 p.m. — Full from dinner and exhausted from my workout, I collapse on his couch. M. searches for movies and decides on  , which I begin to fall asleep too. Since he's seen it a million times, he switches it to . 9:30 p.m. — M. wakes me up from my nap time and off to bed we go. I quickly wash my face, brush my teeth, and ask his Alexa to set an alarm for me. I fall asleep immediately after climbing into bed. Daily Total: $11.41",2,28
"6:30 a.m. — Alexa goes off, we immediately hit the snooze button and close our eyes for a few more minutes before I climb out to shower. 7:20 a.m. — M. gets up while I get ready for work. He starts his days much later than I do, so he can take his time moseying around. He makes me a to-go cup of iced coffee, and I head out for the day. M. is a typical bachelor, so the only thing he has in his fridge is a Brita, which he can never remember to fill, and butter. When I stay the night, I can never pack a breakfast or lunch. I stop at Bruegger's, my favorite bagel store, and grab a Skinny Zesty Egg White on an everything bagel. $5.90 8:15 a.m. — At my desk, I begin my normal routine of skimming emails, eating breakfast, and taking my meds. I text M. to let him know I made it to work and that it rained on my way in. The weather is so wacky these days. 9 a.m. — I log into my personal email and see that the company refinancing one of my private student loans has fully paid out that account. Yippee! I've been meaning to do this for months but kept putting it off, until my interest rate hit 11.375%, which is insanity. Through refinancing the loan, I dropped my interest rate to 5% and changed the repayment to five years versus seven. This should save me about $4,000 over the life of the loan. I went to a small private college, where I had a scholarship for four years and the rest was covered by loans. I will pay about $40 more a month, which I am happy to do, since a greater portion will go to the principle. 11:15 a.m. — It's already been a frustrating morning. A scheduling snafu and complications with a high level role have put me in a grumpy mood. I take a break to skim my email, and notice that Sephora is having a promotion on some skincare items. I hop on and find a watermelon sleeping mask I've been wanting, plus an eyelash curler, since mine broke a few weeks ago. I also use the promo code to add in two more trial items: a vitamin C serum by Drunk Elephant (I love their products and have been wanting to try this one) and a hydrating primer by Tatcha. For my three free samples, I pick a perfume, a sunscreen, soand another primer. I normally use these samples when traveling so I don't have to pack as much, or on nights when I stay at M.'s. $58.19 11:45 a.m. — I hop out to grab lunch, since I didn't pack anything today. I'd normally venture over to Whole Foods to grab a salad and a juice, but instead venture over to Mendocino Farms, which I haven't tried yet. I decide on a chicken and prosciutto salad. I eat at my desk while reading/editing my presentation for next week. $14.89 3:50 p.m. — I snack on the whole wheat tortilla that came with my salad earlier and listen to while mentally going through my checklist. I may have to work this weekend so I can really focus on how to launch the programs well. 5:05 p.m. — My sister texts me and our neighbor to see if we're up for wine later. I'm a bit tired, but a catchup session sounds perfect. I pack up my desk and head out. My aunt calls me on my way home and checks in on me to ask about my health. Since my parents live out of state, she visited and took me to my appointments when I got sick. I let her know things are going well, and we catch up on life. 6:15 p.m. — At home, I unload all my bags and see I have packages that arrived yesterday. My probiotics from Amazon and an Anthropologie package, which has three shirts I ordered. I love Anthropologie, but I only shop their sale section and keep an eye on key items. I do a quick try-on session and love them all! Perfect! I change quickly, and my sister, her boyfriend, and I head out to meet our neighbor at a winery down the street. 6:30 p.m. — We grab menus from our favorite bartender and grab a table. We order four glasses of wine (reds and a rosé) and decide on a meat and cheese board and Mediterranean nachos. After catching up for a few minutes outside, we get cold and snag a table inside. We devour the yummy food, and my sister and her boyfriend grab an additional glass of wine. My sister pays for the food. Our wine is free as part of our monthly membership. I grab our two free bottles for the month. 8 p.m. — Our neighbor, K., and I make our way back home while my sister and her boyfriend head over to grab McDonald's. K. let us know over dinner that she'll be relocating across the country to be with her boyfriend, so these nights will soon become less frequent. I am so happy for her, but will miss having her down the street. 8:30 p.m. — I steal two chicken nuggets from my sister and head to my room to unwind. I wash my face, brush my teeth, and pull out a Korean sheet mask, since my skin has been feeling a bit dry. I light candles and pull out my book, It's really good. 9:40 p.m. — I put away my book, blow out my candles, and make a quick call to M., who is out with his dad. He doesn't answer, so I send him a quick text letting him know I'm heading to bed. I'm asleep within five minutes. Daily Total: $78.98",3,28
"6:20 a.m. — Wake up! My throat is dry and sore. Oh no! I really hope I'm not getting sick. I hop in the shower, take a cold remedy, and do my normal morning routine. 7 a.m. — My sister and I are both in the kitchen organizing our coffee/lunch for the day. She's heading out of town this afternoon and I'm dog-sitting for her friend, so she gives me the details about pickup/drop-off. Luckily she went grocery shopping, so I have options for breakfast and lunch. I make my normal two eggs, add in buffalo chicken meat she grabbed from the deli, and throw salsa on top. I grab an Amy's frozen burrito and an avocado for lunch. And for snacks, I bring leftover blueberries, hummus, a diced-up orange, and pretzel chips. I make my cold brew and am out the door by 7:20. 7:50 a.m. — Get to work. My throat is really hurting and I'm feeling warm. I eat my breakfast and skim my emails. My boss sent me an email last night that throws me for a loop. He and I work well together, but I can tell we're going to disagree on this front. I take my meds and look at my agenda for the day. I have phone calls all morning and meetings until the early afternoon. 10:30 a.m. — Quick text exchange with M. We're going to dinner with his dad tonight and it's my first time meeting him, so I'm a bit nervous. I munch on my blood oranges and chat with one of my colleagues who is also not feeling well. We worked on a project yesterday afternoon together, so I joke with him that he got me sick. He offers me cold medication, but I'm hoping I can fight this off without taking anything. 11:45 a.m. — Take a quick break from reviewing résumés and updating spreadsheets to make myself a green tea from the break room. Someone has brought in sweets, so I grab some to go with my tea. 12:40 p.m. — My boss and I finally sync up and he pushes back on me a bit on the project, but after hearing my concerns, he agrees. Perfect! Following the meeting, I heat up my burrito and cut up the avocado. I need to eat at my desk again today so I can tackle the additional tasks. My boss knows I'm not feeling well, so he tells me to leave when I want. I worked with him previously before taking this job and he trusts me to get my work done, which I appreciate. 2:30 p.m. — My last meeting of the afternoon gets cancelled and I am 90% done with the data I need for the project — just waiting on finance to send me budget allocation numbers. I call my boss to let him know I'm heading home and will be online in 30 minutes. I hate working from home, so he knows if I'm heading home it means I'm not feeling my best. 3 p.m. — Home, and I'm greeted by the sweetest little guy I'm dog sitting. I change quickly into lounge clothes, throw my hair in a bun, and grab my work laptop. The pup curls up next to me while I type away, which lifts my mood. Pups are really the best! 5:15 p.m. — Wrap up my work day and take the dog on a walk. M. lets me know he's on his way, so I scramble to fix my hair and get dressed. 6:30 p.m. — We meet his dad at a steakhouse and grab a table. He's pretty easygoing, and M. has told him a lot about me, so the conversation flows easily. We all order steaks, salads, and drinks. M.'s dad pays. After we wrap up dinner, they want to play pool, so we walk over to a bar and grab a pool table. M. orders a round of drinks and we play a game of “Cutthroat.” I don't play pool usually, but I join in. To everyone's surprise, including my own, I win the first game. We play two more rounds and M.'s dad wins the other two. It's pretty late and I have an early spin class tomorrow, so we head home. M. pays the pool bill. 11 p.m. — Back at home, I take the pup out, drink a glass of water, wash my face, and climb into bed. I use a coconut micellar cleanser from Sephora to take off the day's makeup and any grime. I follow up with my Origins cleanser and put on a nighttime lotion by Fresh. Daily Total: $0",4,28
"6:45 a.m. — A friendly little face wakes me up. He snuggles up on my chest for a few minutes before I get up to wash my face and throw on my gym clothes. I take the dog out for a long walk. 7:45 a.m. — Head out to my spin class, where I'm meeting one of friends/former coworkers. We both love spin and try to meet twice a month for class. 9:15 a.m. — Class is great! The instructor is seven months pregnant and she rocked the class! She reminded us to appreciate every amazing puzzle piece we have and not to worry about finding the last piece. How is it that I always hear the right message when I need it?! Amazing. The best part of class is getting the cold eucalyptus towel at the end! 9:30 a.m. — We walk over to Better Buzz, a tradition of ours, and order iced coffees, plus I get avocado toast with an egg and bacon. I treat. We catch up about life and work, and coordinate details for an upcoming festival we're heading to. She and I worked together for four years, and I definitely miss my old coworkers, but luckily we're pretty good at organizing happy hours and lunches. $22.28 10:45 a.m. — I head back home, walk the dog, chat with my neighbor, and hop in the shower. On the weekends when possible, I take my time showering and getting ready. I swear I do my best thinking in the shower. It's pretty warm outside, so I make sure to add lots of lotion and sunscreen to my face. 11:30 a.m. — I text M. to coordinate our dinner plans for tonight. His dad wants to take us out again, so we decide on a place in Little Italy. His dad also invited me to join them on Sunday for the Padres game. I'm tempted, but with being gone last weekend and the busy week I have coming up, I need a day to get everything together. I spend the next hour sweeping the floors (I have dark hardwood floors that are unforgiving when it comes to dust/dirt), organizing my closet, and cleaning my bathroom. 1:45 p.m. —  I take the dog out quickly and then hop in the car to head to the beach, where I'm meeting up with one of my good friends who is in town. There's a big group of us all who are connected through friends of friends, so we spend the next few hours hanging out. I order grilled fish tacos and a Bloody Mary. $22.57 4 p.m. — Walk the dog and take a quick cat nap before I need to get ready for dinner tonight. My sister sends me a text asking how the pup is and how dinner went last night. I spend a few minutes updating her and fall back asleep. 5 p.m. — Post nap, I get ready for dinner. M. is driving to the restaurant but he's running late, so I let him know I'll grab an Uber and meet him there. $10.12 6 p.m. — It's a perfect night out, so we grab a patio table. M. gets an Old Fashioned, his dad gets a beer, and I get a rosé cocktail mixed with grapefruit sparkling water. I'm not super hungry since I had a late lunch, so I decide on a small citrus salad. M. gets a spicy chili chicken dish, his dad gets lamb, and we share grilled oysters (yum). His dad pays, despite me protesting. 7 p.m. — Head to a nearby tiki bar, where I get a really strong tequila drink. I take my time sipping it. M. and his dad get Bourbon drinks that are even stronger than mine. His dad pays yet again. We told him we'd like to treat, and he just waved us off. 8:30 p.m. — I am exhausted and ready to go to bed. We walk his dad back to his hotel and head back to my house. Then we walk the dog and play fetch with him. M. talks me into watching , so we watch the first episode, but I'm not convinced this will be something I watch often. 10 p.m. — It's late and we're both tired, so M. leaves and I get in bed.

"6:45 a.m. — Ugh — why am I up? My throat hurts. I guess I didn't fight the cold off. The dog is anxious to get up, so I let him outside on my back patio and doze back to sleep for another 45 minutes. 7:30 a.m. — I guzzle water and throw on a jacket over my pajamas to take the dog to the park. Since it's early, there are only a few dogs around, which I prefer because it's easier to keep my eye out on the little guy. We stay for about 15 minutes and then make our way back to my house. 8 a.m. — I want so desperately to go back to bed, but I need to go the market while it isn't too busy. As predicted, there are only a few cars in the lot, so I know it won't take me forever. I'm hosting a friend dinner later this week, so I need all the fixings for pollo asado tacos. I don't really plan ahead for meals, but rather look to see what's in season and go from there. I grab butternut squash, kidney beans, ground turkey, berries, Japanese eggplant, tofu, shrimp, chicken sausage, eggs, bacon, tortilla, hummus, kombucha (they were buy one get one free), smart bagels, and zucchini for zoodles. $154.32 8:45 a.m. — Clean out the fridge for any items that have spoiled over the week. I hate wasting food, so this always make me a bit sad, but we are generally pretty good at eating through leftovers. I put everything away, start the dishwasher, and make myself an everything bagel with avocado, cream cheese, and tomatoes for breakfast. Two of my friends text me asking if I'm free, but I don't feel great and I need a day to decompress. A year ago, I said yes to everything, and as a result, I overextended myself professionally and personally, so I am really focusing on making time for myself and being able to say no. So instead of a year of yes, I am calling this a year of no. I know it sounds awful, but it's important for me to focus on my health, both physical and emotional. 11 a.m. — Hop in the shower, throw my hair up, and head out the door to head to work. I need to get some items done and my VPN isn't working, so I have to go into the office for a bit. I won't be there for longer than an hour — or that's what I tell myself. 1:30 p.m. — I get through some of the items I needed to get done so I feel better about Monday. My boss and I have a few more email exchanges before I decide it's time to call it quits. I head home and stop to grab gas since I know I'll need to fill up this week. $42.87 1:30 p.m. — Run into CVS to grab my prescription ($40), facial rounds, and razors. My car is filthy and needs a good vacuuming. There's a do-it-yourself car wash by my house, so off I go to vacuum and wash it off ($10). $74.93 3 p.m. — I throw in a load of laundry, take the dog out for fresh air, and start on lunches/dinners for the week. I'm making a butternut squash turkey chili. It's technically more of a winter food, but it holds up really well and is super easy to cook. I dice up red and yellow onion, throw it in the Instapot with olive oil, and let it sauté for a few minutes before adding in the ground sweet Italian turkey to brown. Then I add canned tomatoes, tomato sauce, kidney beans, squash, and my chili mix (chili powder, garlic salt, red pepper flakes, paprika, salt, and pepper). I set the timer for 40 minutes on the chili setting and let it cook. The Instapot makes everything easier; it's the best kitchen investment I've ever made. 4 p.m. — I serve myself a bowl of chili with diced up avocado and grated cheese. Yummy. Then I veg out watching Bravo. 5:30 p.m. — The dog's momma arrives with my sister to pick up the lil guy. She gives me a $50 Starbucks gift card for watching him, which is way too generous. I would watch him for free! They say their goodbyes and I spend a few minutes catching up with my sis. I'm still not feeling super great, so I intend on taking it easy the rest of the night, which I do. I paint my nails, do a face mask, light candles, and read. 9 p.m. — M. calls to say goodnight and check in about how I'm feeling. After we chat for a few minutes, I fall asleep.

"6 a.m. — My alarm goes off and I hit snooze before getting up and taking a shower. I wash my face, do my makeup, and put my hair in a ponytail because it's Monday and I can't be bothered to do anything more. 7:20 a.m. — Pack leftover chili, snacks, coffee, and breakfast, and head to work. 8:10 a.m. — Eat at a bagel with avocado, cream cheese, and tomatoes at my desk while skimming emails. It's Monday, which means new hires and a busy morning. 9:45 a.m. — Back at my desk from a busy morning and my colleague has left a bowl of Starbursts for me. I love chewy candy like any five-year-old does. I laugh and send him a quick thank you email. 10:30 a.m. — Our team coordinator swings by to drop off the final version of a project I gave him last week, and it looks awesome. I make a note to tell my boss so he can give him props later this week! I am a big fan of giving people recognition when they go above and beyond. 12:05 p.m. — Heat up my chili and add the leftover avocado in it from this morning. Eat at my desk while checking my personal email. I get an email from my tax accountant letting me know that my parent's taxes are ready. I also send a quick note to my friends regarding our get-together this week — it's a monthly girls dinner party we just started, and I'm hosting the first one. 2:45 p.m. — Snack on pretzel chips while meeting with my boss to go over last week's projects. We have a tight timeline to get things done, so we dive into the data and come up with a game plan to meet the deadline. It's going to be a busy week! 4:45 p.m. — I need to leave to grab my parents tax documents and head to get my CSA box. I'm hoping for strawberries or berries. Fingers crossed! I'll have to work later tonight, but I would prefer to do that from my couch in my PJs. 6 p.m. — I bring in my CSA haul (cauliflower, lot of oranges, celery, avocado, asparagus, and spinach), the tax documents, and grab the mail. My Sephora shipment arrived – yippee! Time to start dinner, so I grab the Japanese eggplant, firm tofu, onion, canned baby corn, and water chestnuts. I dice the eggplant and onion and cook it in sesame oil for a few minutes before throwing in cubed tofu and veggies. Then I add a teriyaki stir-fry sauce, hoisin sauce, and a garlic chili paste. I let it all my simmer for about 15 minutes. I heat up both brown rice (for me) and cauliflower rice (for my sister) and pour it all over the rice. Delicious! We sit down and watch before switching it to . 8 p.m. — I need to catch up on my work, so I head to my room, throw on trashy reality TV for background noise, and hop online. M. texts me shortly after, asking if he can swing by on his way home. I finish my work before he gets there, and we spend time catching up while I force him to watch terrible reality TV. 10 p.m. — M. leaves. I wash my face, apply my new night lotion, and set my alarm for 6 a.m. Fingers crossed I don't hit snooze. Daily Total: $0",7,28
"7 a.m. — My alarm goes off and I drag myself out of bed to face another Monday. We had a mutual friend crash at our place for the weekend, and it's been great fun, but also exhausting! I'm ready to have my couch back. I take too long showering and can tell I'm going to be late for work. Luckily, my hours are somewhat flexible. Before leaving the house, I spritz my face with rosewater and then apply a Vitamin C and hyaluronic acid serum I recently picked up at TJ Maxx, followed by Dr. Jart+ Water Drop moisturizer. My go-to work makeup look is black-brown mascara, Glossier Cloud Paint in the ""Beam"" shade, and Burt's Bees lip balm or Lipstick Queen Frog Prince. 8:20 a.m. — Arrive at work and prep for our Monday morning team meeting. It's unusually cold for this time of year, and the fact that the air conditioning is on full blast in the office is really bumming me out. I'm still freezing when the meeting is over, so I make a quick trip to the hospital café for a cup of turmeric tea. $2.05 12:15 p.m. — It's been a long and stressful morning, and I am so ready for my lunch break! I'm very lucky to have my parents live close to my work, so I often take advantage of the opportunity for a free meal at their place during my lunch break. I eat a fresh cinnamon roll and a bowl of raspberries before heading back to work. 1:45 p.m. — I have to head to a meeting downtown, so I grab an Uber. I could technically expense it, but for some reason that makes me feel guilty, so I probably won't. $10.50 4:15 p.m. — Finally out of the meeting! It ran long, but it was very productive, and it was nice to spend time with colleagues who I usually only speak to over email. If I went back to the office now, it would already be the end of the day by the time I got back, so I decide to run an errand since I'm already downtown. On my way to the shopping center, I stop at Starbucks for a tall matcha soy latte and dark chocolate peanut butter cups, which I pay for using my parents' gold card via the Starbucks app. They don't mind, since they get to use the rewards points! 4:45 p.m. — Pop into Anthropologie to get a diffuser for the office. Unfortunately for my wallet, there's an extra 25% off sale promotion going on, so I grab a second diffuser from the sale section for my living room, and also pick up a bottle of black tea perfume that I intend to use as a linen spray. (What can I say? Anthropologie is my weakness!) While I'm in the store, I drop my favorite sunglasses and one of the lenses pops out. My boyfriend says he'll try to fix them for me, so I hold off on buying a replacement pair. $81.22 5:25 p.m. — I take an Uber home from downtown. It's rush hour, so we get stuck in traffic. Ugh. When I get home, I relax on the couch while finishing up work emails. My cat comes and snuggles up beside me, which makes the fact that I had to bring work home with me way less awful. $17.75 7 p.m. — I ""make"" dinner for my boyfriend and me: leftover fried chicken from this weekend with prepared mashed potatoes we bought at the grocery store last week. I had planned to make worms and dirt for dessert as a special treat, but by the time I'm done heating the chocolate pudding, I don't have the energy to add the extra decorations. After dinner, I read a novel while my boyfriend catches up on his favorite TV show. 11:45 p.m. — Bedtime! I do a minimal nightly skin care routine: cleanse my face with Yes to Cotton face wipes, moisturize, and apply lip balm. Normally, I would read in bed for a while, but tonight it's lights off by midnight because I'm exhausted. Daily Total: $111.52",1,29
"7 a.m. — My alarm goes off, but I feel terrible. I cuddle with my kitty for a few minutes before getting up to put the kettle on. Hopefully some tea will turn this day around. I do my usual pre-work skincare and makeup routine and get dressed for work. 8 a.m. — Once I arrive at work, I head to the mailroom to drop off my Le Tote return. (I had attempted to leave it out for our mailman yesterday, but it never got picked up. That's New Orleans for you!) I'm still feeling a little nauseated, so I run to the cafeteria for toast before heading back to the office. I get a 20% employee cafeteria discount. $1.04 12 p.m. — Another long morning! I I have a patient visit and after that, the team has an initial phone interview with a potential new employee. The meeting goes well enough, but by the time we finish debriefing afterwards, I am STARVING. I head over to my parents' house (did I mention I'm a shameless freeloader?) where I make myself a cheese plate with crackers and grapes. 5 p.m. — After spending the afternoon doing a patient visit and good old-fashioned data entry, I get out of work 30 minutes behind schedule. I walk to a nearby neighborhood to meet with potential new roommates for when my boyfriend moves home after graduation, and make it home in time for (my #1 guilty pleasure). I spend the rest of the evening reading and snacking on Thin Mints while I wait for my boyfriend to get home so we can eat dinner together. 8 p.m. — My boyfriend gets out of class for the day and we decide on pasta for dinner. I put the water on the stove while he hops in the shower. While I wait, I customize my next Le Tote shipment. After dinner, I clean up and we watch reruns of . I fall asleep on the couch, so he sends me to bed around 11 p.m. Daily Total: $1.04",2,29
"7 a.m. — I turn off my alarm and hop in the shower. This time, I'm running on schedule, and am on my way to work by 7:45. It's a bright morning, but luckily my boyfriend was able to fix my sunglasses! I keep my fingers crossed that they don't fall apart again as soon as I put them in my purse. Once I get to work, I get settled in for the morning while fighting the temptation to go to the café for a snack. 12 p.m. — I'm super hungry, but all of my coworkers are busy with patients. I can't leave the phones unattended, so I have to wait for at least one of them to get back before I can go to lunch. I catch up on emails for the next 20 minutes or so and then head over to my parents' house. It's a beautiful spring day today and my office has no windows, so I relish the opportunity to be outside. The sunshine has me dreaming of brunch, so I have French toast drizzled with maple syrup and topped with raspberries for good measure. I wash it all down with OJ before heading back to work. 12:45 p.m. — I've got a serious case of the post-lunch yawns and can't focus on work, so I take a brain break and walk over to the water cooler to refill my S'well bottle. Then I read articles on my phone using my boyfriend's login. (His grad school offers free online subscriptions to students.) 4:30 p.m. — Finish up a couple of emails and I'm outta here! I head to the local Starbucks for a venti pineapple black tea and a peanut butter cup cookie with my parents' card. Just as I'm about to leave, my parents arrive with their pup in tow! We hang out together on the patio for a while, and since my boyfriend has another late class today, I decide to go over to their house for dinner. I chill on the couch and read a novel that I left there for emergency entertainment purposes. My parents don't feel like cooking, so my mom goes out to get chicken fingers. (We class it up by eating in the dining room as a family.) After dinner, I head back to my apartment. The fast food isn't sitting too well, so I end up going to bed early and am asleep by 10 p.m. Daily Total: $0",3,29
"7 a.m. — It's time to get ready for work, but I can't even open my eyes. I had a crazy restless night with multiple nightmares, and now I feel like I've been hit by a bus. Is a fast food hangover a thing?? I hit snooze on my alarm and pray that a little extra rest will put out this dumpster fire of a headache. My cat hops up onto the bed and curls up with me, and I nap for about half an hour. 9:30 a.m. — I get out of a meeting and decide there's no way I can make it through the rest of this morning without breakfast. Normally I'm not really hungry in the morning, so I just drink water and wait until lunch to eat, but I'm sluggish and useless this morning, so I head to the cafeteria for a cup of fruit salad ($2.19 after 20% discount) and then to the café for green tea ($3.71). The barista this morning is new, and she overcharges me by mistake, but I'm too tired to complain. When I get back to my desk and open the fruit salad, all the strawberries burst out into my lap. What a day! I read today's theSkimm newsletter and scroll through my Facebook newsfeed while I eat. $5.90 12:15 p.m. — Every Thursday I have a lunch date with my boyfriend, and today we decide on sushi. We order tuna tataki, smoked salmon, and whitefish sushi, plus spicy tuna rolls. Even though it's not busy, the service is really slow and it takes us almost my entire lunch break just to get our food. I scarf down my portion and then dash back to work. My boyfriend covers the check ($53.71). 4:30 p.m. — I leave work for the day feeling particularly worn out. Lucky for me, I'm going with my boyfriend to a fancy end-of-year banquet tomorrow night, so I have an appointment at my favorite local day spa for a gel manicure. I don't get gel polish anywhere else — this place offers an environmentally friendly gel system that's made from seaweed. I go for a soft pink shade in honor of the season. The service itself is $55 and I leave a 20% tip for my manicurist. $66 5:45 p.m. — I head home from the spa to grab a snack and am pleased to see that my dress from Rent the Runway has arrived! I eat a few Swedish ginger thins and then head to a nearby nail salon for a pedicure. They honestly do a better job at this salon than at the fancy spa I was at earlier, and it's basically half the price ($28, plus 20% tip). Once my toes are dry, I head back home for dinner. We make grilled cheese sandwiches with real cheddar and dunk them into tomato bisque. After dinner, my boyfriend plays a video game and I watch for a while before going to the bedroom to read. I fall asleep with my book on my chest at around 11 p.m. $33.60 Daily Total: $105.50",4,29
"6 a.m. — I going to work early today because I want to leave work early to get ready for tonight's banquet. I hit the shower and am at work by 7:15 a.m. I'm starving, so I head to the cafeteria for scrambled eggs and toast. They're out of normal orange juice this morning, so I get an Odwalla juice (at a ridiculous markup!) instead. While I'm eating, I check my online banking and notice that our utility bill for this month has finally gone through. I send a Venmo request to my boyfriend for his half of the bill. $7.93 12 p.m. — My department is holding a lunchtime networking reception today at another hospital. Fortunately, I'm able to catch a ride with a coworker instead of spending money on an Uber. We have to do a bunch of embarrassing icebreakers, but the free food nearly makes up for it. 4 p.m. — I head home to get ready for the banquet. When I arrive, I find my new Le Tote package by the mailbox. I'm glad it came so quickly, because I had picked out a pair of earrings that will look great with my dress! We leave around 5:30 but get stuck in traffic on our way to the venue, which is a fancy restaurant downtown. Fortunately, we arrive before they start serving dinner. The event starts winding down at around 8, so we walk back to the car. My feet are feeling pretty raw from my shows. When we get home, I fall asleep while my boyfriend looks for a movie on Netflix. Truly a glamorous evening! Daily Total: $7.93",5,29
"10 a.m. — I wake up feeling refreshed, but when I get out of bed I realize just how serious my blister situation is. I'm first aid certified, so I treat the blisters and apply blister bandages before packing up my Rent the Runway return. My boyfriend is still asleep, so I take my time getting ready for the day. Once my boyfriend is up, we head over to the nearest UPS store to drop off the package. There's a Smoothie King in the same strip mall, so we grab smoothies for breakfast. I get a small Dark Chocolate Banana and he gets a medium Caribbean Way. He pays, but I Venmo him for mine. $5.29 11 a.m. — We stop by my parents' house to return my sister's shoes, which I had borrowed to wear last night. My boyfriend immediately conks out on the couch, so I spend quality time with the dog and my sister. When my boyfriend wakes up, it's already 1 p.m. and he wants lunch. We decide to go for tacos and invite my sister to come with. Since it was my boyfriend's idea to go out for lunch, he pays ($63). 3 p.m. — We drop my sister off at home and head to the mall to run errands. My boyfriend needs a new pair of jeans, since he recently wore through a belt loop on his favorite pair, and I want to pick up essentials at Sephora since it's their Beauty Insider sale this weekend. I'm a VIB, so I get 15% off. I pick up a bottle of Ouai Wave Spray and decide to try their dry shampoo as well, since the store is out of my usual brand. I also get a travel size tube of Pinwheel's Wild Child perfume because I really liked the free sample I received one time. It comes to $63.27, but I have $35 in store credit from a past return. I put the rest on my debit card. $28.27 5 p.m. — Head to the grocery store to pick up ingredients for dinner. We buy a pound of boneless skinless chicken thigh filets and broccoli, as well as two kinds of La Croix and pineapple juice. My boyfriend insists on getting a half dozen donuts, too, and I don't protest too much. When we get home, we make Cajun chicken with mashed potatoes and steamed broccoli for dinner, which we eat at around 7. We haven't done a great job of cooking at home this week, so hopefully tonight is a sign that we're back on the wagon. After dinner, we watch a comedy special on Netflix while waiting for our friends to get back from the movies so that we can go out together. $25.42 10 p.m. — Our friends call to let us know that they've arrived at the rooftop bar we were planning to go to, but they're at capacity and our friends don't want to wait to be let in, so they decide to go to a house party instead. My boyfriend and I decide to stay in, and we spend the rest of the night watching Netflix before turning in at around 1 a.m. Daily Total: $58.98",6,29
"8 a.m. — I get up and get in the shower. On Sundays, I use a weekly clarifying shampoo followed by a deep conditioning hair mask instead of my usual shampoo and conditioner. When I'm done in the shower, I spray it all over with foaming bleach spray. While I wait for the shower to disinfect, I throw on a ceramide sheet mask. (I got a huge variety pack of sheet masks from a secret Santa exchange this past Christmas and I'm still working my way through them.) 11 a.m. — It's Fleet Week, so my boyfriend and I are meeting up with a mutual friend to tour the ships that are docked at the Port of New Orleans. On the way to meet our friend, we stop at Smoothie King, and I get another dark chocolate banana smoothie. $5.77 3 p.m. — After touring a French Navy ship, a Canadian Navy ship, and a U.S. Navy ship, we are starving (and sunburnt)! We stop at a local Mexican chain restaurant, where I get a chicken burrito, a strawberry churro, and an iced tea. After we eat, we head back to the river to see all the tall ships that are docked there. The lines are way too long to go on any of the tours, but we get cool pictures. After we pass by the last of the ships, we walk back to our friend's apartment building to pick up the car. $15.50 6:30 p.m. — I suggest that we eat last night's leftovers for dinner so that we don't end up forgetting them in the fridge. After dinner, we do more chores around the house until my boyfriend leaves for his weekly game night. While scrolling through my Facebook feed, I notice that a classmate from undergrad is hosting a birthday fundraiser. It's a good cause, so I make a donation. I realize all the sun I got earlier today combined with the blue light from my phone screen are starting to give me a migraine, so I pop Excedrin and head to bed at around 9:45. $5 Daily Total: $26.27",7,29
"7 a.m. — Lord please no. Make it stop!! I've snoozed my alarm for the past 30 minutes and am still struggling to get moving this morning. I wake up to the snuggliest boyfriend, E., having completely forgot that I slept over at his place last night (thank you, NyQuil). Today is day 10 of fighting a terrible cold, but thankfully E. has been really into playing doctor lately and drags me out of bed to down some meds. He makes me an Americano with his Nespresso while I shower and then I'm ready and out the door by 7:35. E. walks me to my car and kisses me goodbye. 8:45 a.m. — One of my coworkers gets to work with a giant box of gourmet donuts from a shop downtown. I send an email to the office letting everyone know, and make my way to the kitchen for a cup of coffee and a donut. 9:30 a.m. — I remember it's payday and immediately get to paying my bills. I pay half of my reoccurring monthly bills every payday, so I pay my phone and car insurance bills. I also put $750 towards my credit card and move $385 into Digit for rent and bills later on down the road. 10:30 a.m. — I get a text from a friend inviting me to the spring sample sale for the designer she works for. As much as I'd like to go to support her, my budget doesn't allow for anything costly right now and the times sadly interfere with my work schedule, so I respectfully decline. This is the fourth time she's invited me to a sample sale and I've had to decline, so I have a feeling it will probably be the last. 12 p.m. — I scarf down the last of the fried rice I brought from home and go for a mile-long power walk. Everything is blooming and it is just lovely. I attempt to meditate in my car when I get back to the office, but my Headspace app won't load, so I scroll Instagram for a bit and catch up with my aunt on WhatsApp. She's heading to Chile for one of our cousin's weddings and it saddens me that I can't attend. Living in a different country than half of my family isn't always easy. 1 p.m. — Apparently there was an earthquake while I was out on my walk and everyone is talking about it. Super confused because I didn't feel a thing, so I make tea and check the , which calls the earthquake “the most powerful in years.” I grew up with hurricanes, so I find earthquakes intriguing yet terrifying at the same time. 3:30 p.m. — Tea time. I also grab a Snyder's 100-calorie pack from the office snack cabinet. My office provides K-cup coffee, Nespresso, soda, tea, and a variety of healthy snacks. 5 p.m. — I'm meeting my old roomie/bestie for birthday drinks tonight after her exam, so I head home to relax for a bit. I'm ravenous, but my fridge is basically empty, so I run down to the Jersey Mike's under my building and get a turkey sandwich combo. I devour the entire thing in less than 10 minutes, like a savage. Then I watch last night's episode of on the CW (seriously the cutest show!) and crawl into bed to unwind, since I'm still not feeling well. My best friend from college texts me asking if I felt the earthquake, and we end up chatting for two hours about her upcoming trip and life in general. She just moved to a new state with her boyfriend and is feeling the struggle of making new friends as an adult. $12.30 8:30 p.m. — The birthday girl is unable to get out of class early, so we reschedule for next Wednesday. I'm secretly relieved, since my anxiety has been through the roof today. I take a quarter of a Xanax and a long hot shower, Shiseido hair mask and all. Then I blow dry my hair and jade roll my face using my favorite Kiehl's Midnight Recovery Concentrate while watching on Netflix. The movie is terrible, so I turn it off halfway and get sucked into the black hole that is natural skincare on Instagram. 10:15 p.m. — Earplugs and silk eye mask, and then I'm out like a light. Daily Total: $12.30",1,30
"7:10 a.m. — It's another chill morning in L.A., so I stay snuggled up in my cloud of a bed a little longer than usual. I do my extensive skincare regimen, jade roller and all, apply minimal makeup to make me look alive, and throw loose curls in my naturally wavy hair. I drink my morning Bragg apple cider vinegar and I'm out the door in under 30 minutes. Today is the first day in what feels like forever that I wake up feeling well. 9:45 a.m. — I am surprisingly not hungry this morning, but I force myself to drink a protein shake anyways. The Reset360 shakes are my absolute favorite! They are so satisfying, yet so delicious — I highly recommend. Friday is bagel day at the office, so I squirrel away two bagels for the weekend (it's all about balance). I take my vitamins and check my phone for the first time all morning and see that my boyfriend, E., has sent me a slew of sweet morning texts. Morning made. 11:15 a.m. — I fill up my S'well water bottle (I drink a ton of water and probably refill it about 10 times throughout the work day), make myself another mug of green tea with added collagen powder, and snack on pistachios from my desk stash. 12 p.m. — I run to Trader Joe's for my weekly haul and end up just buying things to tide me over for the next couple of weeks. I buy organic strawberries, bananas, apples, shredded carrots, a tomato, mixed greens, frozen pineapples, frozen mangos, a frozen tropical fruit blend, mushrooms, spiraled carrots, turkey meatballs, a large bag of organic chicken breasts, green tea mochi, green tea, organic maple syrup, pasta sauce, miso ginger salad dressing, hummus, two ThinkThin Brownie Crunch bars, reduced sodium pistachio nuts, roasted seaweed snacks, coconut water, and three bottles of wine. I get back to the office and make a large smoothie with greens, frozen fruit, and chia seeds. $115.32 3:30 p.m. — I take a break from work to order more Vitamin C serum on Amazon Prime. $19.99 5:30 p.m. — E. declares tonight a date night. I quickly change, and we walk down to the ocean. The beachfront hotel/restaurant on the boardwalk he wanted to take me to is slammed, so we turn around and head to our favorite beach-y dive bar. We each order two Bud Lights, split a small basket of fries, and catch up on life and the status of where I'm at with my debt repayment. I love how transparent we are with our finances and how supportive we both are of each other. E. pays ($42), and we head to the pier to catch the sunset. 7:20 p.m. — Neither of us is in the mood to fight the crowds at a formal restaurant, so we decide on Wagyu burgers at a new fast casual spot in the neighborhood. We each get a double cheese burger, and E. gets a beer. The burgers are AMAZING. His treat. 8:15 p.m. — We make a pit stop for froyo on our walk home. I get an original with a variety of chocolatey toppings, and E. gets a little of everything. He treats again. 8:45 p.m. — Home and shower time. We share a bottle of wine from my Trader Joe's haul and watch the season finale of on Bravo. So trashy, yet so satisfying! It's our guilty pleasure. 10:30 p.m. — Skincare routine, then I'm out like a light. Daily Total: $135.31",2,30
"7 a.m. — I am surprisingly up before my alarm and not hungover! We stay snuggled up in bed for a while and start making moves for the day when the alarm goes off. E. showers while I make the bed, and then he makes us breakfast while I steam our clothes. We split an everything bagel with scrambled eggs, turkey sausage, and nutritional yeast, and I put our new Ninja blender to the test and make us a shake with chocolate protein powder, water, banana, and chia seeds. We split it, and E. cleans the kitchen while I get ready for the day. 9:15 a.m. — We're heading to Newport Beach today, so I make a quick stop at Costco to fill up my gas tank before we hit the road ($50.15). We make it in a little under an hour, which allows us time to walk around and explore the sleepy town for a bit. Oh the beauty that is being on the road before 11 a.m. during a weekend in Los Angeles! I pay for five hours of parking, just to be safe ($7.80). $57.95 11 a.m. — Whale watching time! I bought us tickets on Groupon a couple of weeks ago. It was supposed to be a surprise for E., but I accidentally blurted it out over wine last weekend. Whoops! He gives me his card to go get us a round of drinks at the bar on the ship. I get us each a Bloody Mary and a small bag of Fritos to share, since I am feeling a bit seasick. I tip 15% because the bartender was so friendly ($32). 1:30 p.m. — The trip was such a treat. We saw two whales and a bunch of sea lions. My favorite part was just being out on the water and away from the hustle and bustle of city life. I grew up on the water and find myself missing the simplicity of island life a lot these days. 2:30 p.m. — On the road back home. Traffic is a nightmare and I end up getting rear-ended on the 405. Awesome. The other driver is in a rental car on his way back to LAX to catch a flight home, so we exchange contact and insurance info, plus I get his Hertz information. I'm really shaken up, but somehow I hold it together. 4 p.m. — I call my parents for advice as soon as I get home, because I've never been in an accident before. E. suggests fresh air, so we walk to the diner across the street for a late lunch. We share a Mediterranean platter and a turkey club with a side of steamed broccoli. I can't find my wallet, so he pays ($28). 5:45 p.m. — I check my car for my wallet and realize that the hat I was wearing must have flown off in the accident, because it somehow made its way into the back of my car. No wonder my neck is sore. I wash my face to de-stress when I get back upstairs and open a bottle of wine for us to share. We drink it while watching the season finale of . 8 p.m. — I'm still pretty full from our late lunch, but E. is hungry, so I make us lentil pasta. He goes to the grocery store across the street because he wants more red wine, and I only have a bottle of white left. I meditate while he's gone. 10:30 p.m. — E. spills his wine all over my carpet and coffee table. I take deep breaths and proceed to help him clean it up. He freaks out, and the next thing I know, he's leaving. Super confused as to why he's upset in the first place, but I offer to get him an Uber. He refuses and keeps trucking on. Stubborn men, I swear. He lets me know when he's home, and I take a quarter of a Xanax and go to sleep, exhausted from the day. Daily Total: $57.95",3,30
"8 a.m. — Awake and decide to have a lazy morning in bed. This is very rare for me, so I enjoy every moment of it. 10:40 a.m. — E. calls me after the gym to apologize for everything last night. He expresses to me that dealing with my anxiety and depression has been really hard on him. This is hard to hear — I had no idea it had been affecting him so much. But it means a lot that my happiness means so much to him. 2:30 p.m. — Make my way out of bed and shower. I throw three pieces of bacon in the oven before realizing that we used the last of my eggs yesterday morning. Too lifeless to care, I eat the bacon without eggs and spend the rest of my afternoon on the couch watching movies while doing a series of face masks. 5:30 p.m. — I throw a Stouffer's Tuna Noodle Casserole in the oven and pop some popcorn. My sister texts me to cancel our plans for tomorrow. Apparently she has a work outing she forgot about and asks me if we can reschedule. I find myself aimlessly scrolling Instagram for the umpteenth time today, and then decide to delete the stupid app once and for all. 8:30 p.m. — I cut up strawberries and pack up a week's worth of snacks to bring to work with me in the morning. Then I go to sleep hoping for a better day tomorrow. Daily Total: $0",4,30
"6:45 a.m. — Monday, we meet again. I make my bed, open all the blinds, and do my usual skincare routine. Then I make a chocolate banana protein shake to bring to the office with me, water my orchid, and place it by an open window to get fresh air for the day. Traffic is a nightmare this morning, but I still make it to to the office by 8 a.m. 9 a.m. — Work is the last place I want to be right now. We have our weekly office meeting and I sit in the back to avoid having to talk to anyone. I'm usually really good at plastering a smile on my face when I'm down and pretending to be my usual cheerful self, but I am finding it impossible to shake this funk today. I text my therapist when the meeting is over to see if she can see me tomorrow instead of Wednesday. In the meantime, E. texts me to wish me a wonderful day and to apologize again. He asks if he can see me tonight to make it up to me. I decide to wait until I hear back from my therapist to respond. 10:35 a.m. — I eat a ThinkThin protein bar while drinking my third mug of tea for the day. 12 p.m. — I make avocado and lox toast sprinkled with Trader Joe's Everything But The Bagel seasoning and crushed red pepper, and then call Hertz to file a claim from the accident on Saturday. I drink the shake I brought from home while on the phone. They give me a claim number and tell me I should hear back from them within five business days with the next steps. 1 p.m. — I get back to the office and file a claim with my insurance company online. It looks like I won't be hearing from them for another day or so either. What a mess. My therapist texts me to tell me that she's unable to move our appointment to tomorrow, so I text E. back telling him he can come over tonight. 5 p.m. — Feeling emotionally and mentally drained, so I call my sister on my drive home to see if she's free on Friday afternoon. We haven't been on speaking terms since last summer, so the call brings up a ton of emotions. We laugh and we cry, and I hang up feeling like a huge weight has been lifted off my chest. 5:30 p.m. — I change into workout clothes and then E. and I go for a long walk to talk things out. Fighting isn't a normal thing for us since we normally communicate very well, but I can't help but feel that we are stronger because of it. 6:45 p.m. — We go to an Asian fusion restaurant we both like on the 3rd Street Promenade for a glass of wine. They tell us it's happy hour all night, and since it's so nice outside, we decide to make an impromptu date night out of it. We take advantage of the incredibly low prices and order pretty much everything on the menu. E. has three beers and I have three glasses of rosé. The bartender feels bad that the kitchen is backed up and gives us a free shot of a delicious whiskey and hibiscus concoction. E. insists on paying ($109 plus tip). We walk home feeling full and happy. 9 p.m. — We settle in for season 2 of on Hulu. 10:30 p.m. — E. has a sweet tooth, so I bake him chocolate chip cookies and do my skincare routine before crawling into bed for the night. Earplugs and silk eye mask, then it's light out. Daily Total: $0",5,30
"7 a.m. — Thankful to the hangover gods for doing me a solid and not hitting me hard this morning. We shower and E. makes my bed and tidies up the kitchen while I get ready for work. I made a comment to E. last night that I forgot to water my plants (crazy plant lady alert — I have close to 20), and the next thing I know, he's moved all of my plants into the kitchen and is watering them. What a guy. We place them on the coffee table by the open balcony door to sunbathe for the day. He walks me to my car and kisses me goodbye before heading back home. 9:30 a.m. — Another busy morning at the office. I eat a ThinkThin bar and sip on Earl Grey tea while working. 11 a.m. — I sign for the Georgetown Cupcakes delivery I ordered for one of our employee's birthdays. They are seriously the cutest. 11:15 a.m. — My boss asks me to go to Target with him to return items he bought and I oblige. We discuss a new birthday policy for the office while in the car, because I've noticed a trend of quite a few birthdays going unrecognized despite being on his calendar. 12 p.m. — Back at the office. A coworker and I decide it's too beautiful of a day to eat inside, so we prep our lunches to go. I make a tropical fruit and chia seed smoothie and the same avocado lox toast as yesterday. We eat at a communal lunch area down the street and he updates me on all the lady happenings in his life. He tends to go for younger girls and I find his love life to be so entertaining. 2:44 p.m. — I take a shot of apple cider vinegar and cut up an apple to snack on along with my pistachios. I sip on green tea with collagen powder while I do research on the best sites to post the intern position we are looking to fill for the summer. 4 p.m. — I text my cousin via WhatsApp to confirm dinner next Monday when she's in town. I see that E. texted me a picture of the refund check from my old landlord which arrived today (my old roommate and I didn't know where we would be living, so we had it sent to his apartment). I notice our landlord deducted $600, so I text him immediately, as well as my old roomie. She's pretty pissed, because we left the apartment in far better shape than it was in when we moved in, and we had to live with termites for several months. I shrug it off for now and make a plan to put $200 towards joining the YMCA down the street from my apartment ($150 initiation fee, plus a $50 membership). I cancelled my kickboxing membership in the New Year, as I couldn't justify the high cost, and have been dying to get back into the gym. 5:30 p.m. — I check the mailroom and see that my package from Amazon was stolen (RIP Vitamin C Serum), so I walk over to the leasing office and let them know. This is my third package that has either not shown up or been stolen since I moved into this apartment a couple of weeks ago. I'm very frustrated, but I decide not to let it ruin my day. I snack on pretzels and hummus while I marinate chicken in TJ's Soyaki, run the dishwasher, and change into shorts. I grab my book, , and go read up on the roof area. 6:30 p.m. — I shower and then sage myself and my apartment. I've had seriously bad luck for several months now, so I'm really hoping this helps. I accidentally scratch the burn on my forehead from my curling iron and end up bleeding everywhere. 7 p.m. — I put Polysporin on my scab, and then it's dinner time. I throw on my favorite Ben Howard record while I cook the chicken I marinated and make a salad with mixed greens, tomato, shredded carrots, and carrot ginger dressing. I bought the dressing on a whim, and I have to say it is DELICIOUS! I pack the leftovers for lunch tomorrow. 8 p.m. — It's a beautiful night, so I drink tea on the couch and stare aimlessly out my open balcony door at the city lights. Then I write in my gratitude journal and reflect on past entries. I haven't written in a while and I'm starting to realize how much it affects me when I don't. 9 p.m. — I crawl into bed and scroll through OfferUp to look at coffee tables, since E. is insisting on replacing the one he ruined over the weekend. I fall in love with a vintage bohemian table on the app, but it's sadly already been sold. My old one, which was only a few months old, is on sale, so I'll probably just get the same one. 10:15 p.m. — I go to sleep proud of myself for having three consecutive days of no spending. Daily Total: $0",6,30
"8 a.m. — A coworker stops me in the parking lot to give me a little something she has for me. This coworker is fairly new to the company and much older, so the gift comes as a surprise and really touches me. Just as I was beginning to lose faith in humanity… 8:15 a.m. — I take my ThermoPlus vitamin and sip on a cup of coffee with collagen powder while diving into my emails for the day. 9 a.m. — I make peanut butter toast with honey and chia seeds and eat at my desk. I also munch on strawberries. I take the rest of my daily vitamins: super algae, vitamin D3, a multivitamin, and 5-Htp. 10:30 a.m. — It's a very quiet day at the office, so I write E.'s mom a thank you card for the housewarming present she sent me a couple of weeks ago. Call me old-fashioned, but I prefer sending handwritten cards over digital ones any day. 11:20 a.m. — Hungry and bored, I snack on roasted seaweed and catch up on today's Money Diary. The comment section gets me every single time. Like a trashy romcom, I just can't stop reading. 12 p.m. — All of the McDonald's talk in that MD has me craving nuggets, so I abandon the salad I brought from home and get a Mighty Kids Meal. Everything is sadly overcooked and flavorless, but I am ravenous. I reschedule a laser hair appointment while in the drive-through. $4.81 12:30 p.m. — I make a smoothie with the greens from my salad, strawberries, frozen fruit, and chia seeds. I also take a shot of apple cider vinegar to prevent heartburn later on in the day. I have to leave work early today, so I cut my lunch break short. 3:30 p.m. — After about an hour of reading California renters rights, I decide to message my dad the itemized deduction list from my landlord along with all of the photos I took of the unit before we moved out. My parents are landlords, and although they're in a different state, I can use any advice I can get. $450 for paint just isn't settling well with me. I re-read our lease and email the landlord requesting itemized receipts for the deductions. I mentally prepare to have to go to small claims court. 5:15 p.m. — I meet with my therapist for our biweekly appointment ($35). I've been seeing her for several months and I really look forward to our sessions. Not only do I feel like they've been helping me grow as a person, but I've also noticed an improvement with my communication skills and a better handle on controlling my emotions and stress. I'm a work in progress, but I always leave our sessions with a clearer head. 6:20 p.m. — I run up to my apartment to grab my denim jacket and change purses before walking over to the wine bar across the street. The place is packed, but I somehow snag two seats at a communal high top and order a bottle of cabernet while I wait for my old roomie/bestie. We haven't seen each other in three weeks, and you'd think it would have been a lifetime with the hug we have when she walks through the door. We spend over three hours catching up about everything under the sun and share two bottles of wine and a small meat lover's flatbread. Bottles are half off on Wednesdays, so we each spend $29.77 plus tip. $35 10 p.m. — What a week! I chat on the phone with the BF while doing my skincare routine. Then I down several glasses of water and it's lights out. Daily Total: $39.81",7,30
"7:30 a.m. — Alarm goes off. I hit snooze and scroll through Instagram on my phone until 8. The puppy starts making noise, so my partner, G., gets up, gives him breakfast, and takes him downstairs to pee. I throw clothes on and do my morning skin care routine of exfoliating toner, vitamin C serum, moisturizer, and sunscreen. We put the puppy in his jacket and are out the door by 8:20. 8:45 a.m. — We drop the puppy off at daycare before we go our separate ways downtown. Paying for puppy daycare is expensive — we buy 10 days at a time for $380 and alternate who pays. (10 days lasts us about five weeks.) 9 a.m. — Make it to work. My boss is back from vacation. I'm glad she's back, because we're the only two from the company sitting at this client site right now. We chat for a bit before digging into work. A few months ago, I bought a coffee maker specifically to save money on coffee, but I couldn't be bothered to use it this morning, so I go to the coffee shop downstairs in my building and get an Americano. At 10, I make banana nut oatmeal and take my vitamin D. $3.80 12:30 p.m. — It's the start of the new fiscal year for my company, as well as the start of the month, so I have quite a few administrative tasks to take care of, which keeps me busy for most of the morning. I typically work on environment-focused projects, but as a consultant, sometimes I help out with marketing and project management tasks to fill out my billable hours. I take a break to go down the street to a lunch buffet place that I love. They charge by the weight, but I pretty much get the same thing every time, and it's rarely over $6.50. It's worth it to me, because I hate meal prepping. Today I get my usual: salad with soy vinaigrette, two pieces of a California roll, rice, and chicken. $6.61 12:30 p.m. — During lunch I finally pull the trigger on work shoes that have been sitting in my Gap cart for a few weeks. I get a pair of flats and a pair of heels that are both on sale and use an extra 20% off code. $80.15 5 p.m. — I meet G. at the dog daycare, and we head home with the pup. Days when the dog goes to daycare are great because he's so tired he doesn't want to go on a walk in the evening, which gives us extra time. I give the dog dinner and then snack on Kettle Chips and iced tea while I work on adding addresses to our wedding guest list. We're getting married later this year, and even though we're trying to keep it relatively low key, we're planning and paying for the wedding mostly ourselves, so there's a lot to do. 7:30 — G. makes pad see ew noodles with chicken and broccoli for dinner. After dinner, I clean the kitchen and eat Rolos. I have big plans to do more chores and maybe work out, but instead, I pour a glass of wine, do my nightly face routine (retinol serum, hyaluronic acid, and moisturizer) and paint my nails. We've been looking at flights to Oakland for later this summer for our unofficial bachelor/bachelorette weekend, and decide tonight's the night to buy. I've been saving my credit card rewards specifically for this and have $275 to put toward my flight. The flight costs $285.40, so I end up only spending about $10! $10.40 Daily Total: $100.96",1,31
"7 a.m. — Wake up before my alarm but lay in bed until it goes off. G. and the puppy stay in bed while I get dressed, do my morning face routine, and start the coffee maker. I take the puppy out to pee, put leftover noodles in my bag, and jump on the bus. I get a low fare warning, so I reload my ORCA card when I get to work. ($110 expensed) 1 p.m. — Heat up last night's leftovers and an orange I brought from home for lunch at my desk. 5 p.m. — After a pretty uneventful afternoon, I leave a few minutes early to go to my wedding dress appointment at BHLDN. This is my second appointment, so I have a good idea of what I'm actually looking for. My stylist pulls dresses from the list I brought and we start with the ones I've been staring at online the most. I end up falling in love with the first dress I try on and comparing all the others to that one. I try the first dress on again, and I think it's the one! As an added bonus, it just went on a major sale! Like, $1,000 off, major sale! My mom offered to pay for the dress and gave me a pretty big budget, but I've been setting a personal budget of under $1,000. Our wedding isn't going to be extravagant, and I would just feel guilty and uncomfortable wearing a super expensive dress. 6:30 p.m. — I get on the Link and pick up two chicken tikka masalas and rice on my way home because I know G. is working late tonight. We don't usually eat out during the week, but we planned for this today since our schedules were going to be a little out of whack. I get a double order so I can eat the leftovers as lunches. G. tries to Venmo me for dinner, but I tell him this one's on me $29.86 8 p.m. — G. is working late (and his home office desk is in our living room), but he doesn't mind that I have the TV on. I eat a mini Häagen-Dazs ice cream bar for dessert and then accidentally fall asleep on the couch. I wake up, shower, and do my nightly face routine. By 9:30, G. is finally done working and wants to hang out, so we play a round of Carcassonne — a tabletop game kind of similar to Settlers of Catan. Then we get in bed and each read our library books until we fall asleep around 11. Daily Total: $29.86",2,31
"7:30 a.m. — Wake up, get ready, and play with the puppy while I start the coffee maker. Decide to walk to work since it's nice out right now, but put a rain jacket in my bag after I look at the forecast for the rest of the day. Once I get to my desk, I have my coffee from home and make oatmeal while I respond to emails and make my to-do list for the day. 1 p.m. — For lunch I heat up leftover Indian. While I eat, I organize my finances: pay my credit card bill, move money from my savings to my checking for upcoming wedding expenses, and move $2,000 from my savings into my investment account. 3 p.m. — This has felt like a very long Wednesday and I am feeling PMS-y, so I feel like I deserve a treat. I go downstairs to get a cardamom vanilla latte from the coffee shop. $5.51 5 p.m. — I decide to walk home, since it's only slightly raining. I get a call from my sister, who asks me to help her find a new computer, since her Mac broke, and she's going back to school to get her teaching Master's soon. Last year I bought a Lenovo for less than $250 after my Mac died, and she wants a similar deal. When I get home, G. and I take the doggo for a nice long walk. 6:30 p.m. — G. makes veggie lentil soup while I call my mom. I thank her for the jean jacket she got me as an early birthday present that just came in the mail. I told her not to get me anything since she's helping out with a lot of wedding stuff, but she got me a present anyway. I send an email to the wedding caterer, because they just sent us a contract that says their catering minimum is $3,000 — which is almost $1,000 over what they quoted us! 8 p.m. — After dinner, I do a resistance band workout, watch TV, and read. We're asleep by 11:30. Daily Total: $5.51",3,31
"7:30 a.m. — Wake up, get ready, make coffee. Put a Clif Bar in my bag, since I ate the last of the oatmeal that I keep at my desk. Package up the rest of the leftover Indian food. G. and I walk the dog to daycare and I'm at work just before 9. I drink the coffee I made at home and eat my Clif Bar for breakfast. 12:30 p.m. — I planned on eating leftover Indian for lunch, but G. IMs me saying he's craving guacamole and asks if I want to meet him at Chipotle for lunch. We don't usually meet up for lunch like this, so it feels like a treat when we do. I get a chicken burrito bowl and G. gets a chicken burrito. We pay separately. G. wants to go spy on the dog at daycare, so we walk by and watch him through the big windows. All the dogs in the room are napping, but our dog is begging for treats from the attendant! We don't want to disturb the peace, so we leave once one of the dogs notices us and starts barking. $8.09 3 p.m. — I can feel myself start to drag, especially after my big lunch, so I grab an Americano from downstairs. $3.69 5 p.m. — G. is going to a work happy hour tonight, so I pick up the dog and we go home and lay on the couch together. I remember I need to get my sister a birthday present, so I order her a face mask and Balm Dot Com from Glossier. G. is back just before 7, and we eat leftover lentil soup for dinner. $34 7:30 p.m. — We go to the climbing gym! I spend today doing more moderate climbs and focusing on good technique and endurance. When we get home, I do a quick resistance band workout and a take shower. Daily Total: $45.78",4,31
"7:30 a.m. — I wake up a little early. G. is on a conference call, so I try to get ready without making too much noise. I don't want to use the coffee grinder, so I pick up a coffee once I get to work. I'm at my desk by 8:45, eat a Clif Bar, and take my vitamin D. $3.69 12:30 — Lunch is leftover Indian that I packed yesterday. While I'm eating, I get an email from my health insurance with a claim for the insulin pump supplies I bought two weeks ago. (I'm a type 1 diabetic.) I cringe at the bill for $407.10 and decide to wait until the bill from the pump supply company comes, to avoid overpaying the insurance. The supplies should last me three months, but I need to do research to see if I can bring the cost of the supplies down. On a happier note, a friend sends me an invite to a networking/socializing event next week for a talk about salmon habitat restoration at a brewery! 5 p.m. — I take the bus home, and then G. and I take the dog on a walk while we discuss what we want to do tonight. We try to make Friday nights feel like date night even though we spend most nights together. The dog is not happy that it's sprinkling outside, but we make it home without incident. 7 p.m. — We decide we want to get tacos and then go to a barcade! It's raining out, but we walk anyway. That was a mistake — we only make it about four blocks before we're drenched! Our pants and jackets are completely soaked through, which is not normal for Seattle rain! We decide we won't be happy sitting anywhere with completely wet clothes, so we turn around and go home. We contemplate changing and taking a Lyft, but decide we're over it and drive to get Thai food. We order chicken satay, pad see ew, and yellow curry. G. pays. Of course once we start driving, the rain stops. 9 p.m. — We take a short walk to the neighborhood bar to get beers. $16 Daily Total: $19.69",5,31
"8 a.m. — Wake up and make savory toast for breakfast with butter, marmite, and Trader Joe's Everything But The Bagel seasoning. I decide to officially order the wedding dress I tried on ($660.60, paid for by my mom). I have 30 days to return it for a full refund, so I may do another shopping trip in the next couple of weeks just to make sure there isn't one I like better. While I'm in the wedding organizing mood, I call the caterer to negotiate the contract and am able to secure our original quote! Success! I edit the contract before I sign it to make sure they don't go back on their word later, and pay the 50% deposit. $1,160.50 11 a.m. — Puppy is bored, but it's raining, so I put off our walk for later, hoping to catch a break in the rain. G. and I walk to a coffee shop and talk about the personal projects we're working on while we sip cappuccinos. I pay. $8.37 12 p.m. — I go to get my hair trimmed and dyed. I've been slowly transitioning out of (the expensive world of) being super blonde, and today is the first time I dip my toes into darker dye. It turns out great! It looks very natural and I love it. I tip $35. While I'm at the salon, I get my sister a hard-to-find purple conditioner ($25) for her very blonde hair. $252.65 3 p.m. — We take a super wet walk to the dog park. The dog gets to play with two other pups there! By the time we get back to the apartment, I have to peel off soaked jeans again and the dog is shivering, so we snuggle under a blanket and turn on the TV. 6 p.m. — Think about trying to go out to make up for last night, but it's still raining hard, so we decide to spend the night at home. Eat leftover Thai, play video games, and watch TV. 9 p.m. — G. braves the outside to walk to the market to get beers — I give him a rare $20 bill (I never have cash) for a six-pack for me and a bomber for him. He gives me $4 back. We watch a movie and then go to sleep. $16 Daily Total: $1,437.52",6,31
"9 a.m. — G. gets coffees and donuts from Top Pot for breakfast. We take the doggo on a walk and then plan our meals for the week, which helps us keep track of how much we're spending on food and really limits the amount of food we waste. This week were going to make pizza, cilantro jalapeño chicken, and enchiladas. 12 p.m. — This is my week to pay for groceries. We walk to QFC to get chicken broth, pizza crust mix, juice, oatmeal, tomato sauce, pretzels, cilantro, cheddar and mozzarella cheese, tortillas, frozen mac and cheese, Clif Bars, onions, jalapeños, bread, potatoes, sour cream, potato chips, bell peppers, mushrooms, chicken thighs, ground beef, mouthwash, and a case of La Croix. We recently started using reusable mesh bags for our produce, which really cuts down our plastic usage. When we get back, I put the groceries away and eat a frozen mac and cheese for lunch. $95.70 1:30 p.m. — I decide to go to a coffee shop and do a little bit of work on my computer. I've been trying to go to new coffee shops outside of my usual routine, because it makes me feel like I'm constantly exploring the city and helps me feel like I'm not stuck in a rut. I stop in Dick Blick on the way for a notebook, ruler pencil, and eraser  ($17.27) to sketch out and make notes on creative projects that have been sitting in my head and need to be put on paper. When I get to the coffee shop, I order a cappuccino ($5.40). The coffee is good and the shop is really cute, but the vibe feels like I'm an outsider in locals-only territory — not a feeling I super enjoy — especially as I'm trying to make a serious effort to feel more ingrained in my neighborhood. I've lived in Seattle for almost three years, but it's been a little hard to break into the social scene and people are weary of new transplants — even though it feels like most people I meet aren't from Seattle either. $22.67 4 p.m. — Go to the climbing gym. Making progress! Feeling good! 6 p.m. — Make pizza for dinner. I chop veggies while G. works on the crust he started earlier in the afternoon. He's on a mission to perfect a gluten-free pizza crust that we can both enjoy. Tonight's pizza turns out good! But we both agree that the crust last week was better, so we'll try that one again next time. 8 p.m. — I somehow get both of us motivated to do deep cleaning that has been on my list for a while. I clean the bathroom and the kitchen floors while G. deep cleans the fridge and the kitchen counters. I finally take a shower and do an AHA/BHA exfoliating mask before heading to bed at 11.

"7:45 a.m. — It's Sunday. It feels glorious to wake up past 6:30, and I soak up each minute as I slowly wake up to my soothing piano melody alarm. I make my bed and begin my usual morning skincare routine, which consists of ice rolling my face (something I have gotten literally ALL of my friends hooked on). It wakes me up and makes me feel like I have Leighton Meester's skin and Blake Lively's body (it's as much mentally therapeutic as it is physically). I apply Clinique Lotion (I swear by this stuff) as well as Fresh Lotus Youth Preserve Face Cream. I am about to go for a run, so I throw on tinted sunscreen. 8 a.m. — I grab my AirPods and I'm out the door for a short run to my favorite coffee shop. It's nestled in one of the prettiest neighborhoods in Dallas so I get some views with my run. The route I've planned is about four miles and it's tougher than I expected ... maybe no half marathon for me this month. I make it and get my usual — an iced lavender matcha latte, plus a chocolate croissant. I sit outside and enjoy my purchases whilst contemplating Uber-ing home, but realize how absurd that is and begin my trek back. $10 9:15 a.m. — On my way home, I spot a table of girls selling lemonade. (My heart!) One of them runs across the street over to me and asks if I would be interested in buying some (all proceeds go to Children's Hospital). I can hardly bare to tell her that I don't have any cash with me. I am surprised by her reaction, as she offers me some anyway because I look tired. HA! I politely decline again, but decide that if time allows I'll go home for cash and come back – kindness like hers should be encouraged. 10:30 a.m. — I'm home, showered, and ready for church. I grab $10 to take back to the lemonade girls. It has been unseasonably rainy in Dallas this week (which my inner Seattle girl is all about), and I was worried they might have gone inside, but to my great surprise they are still there! I pull over and the little girl recognizes me, rushes over to give me a hug, and introduces me to all of her friends. The group has grown to about 10 girls and I'm seriously considering riding scooters in the street with them until I remember I have about 10 minutes until church starts. I thank them again for their kindness and generosity and say a quick prayer to myself that the the rain holds off for them. Feeling full of joy and happiness, I make it to my spot in the pew with no time to spare. $10 12:45 p.m. — I head to Central Market with my mental shopping list in tow. Going to Central Market is one of my favorite parts of my week. My friends and I have a joke that one day I'll meet my husband in the milk aisle. (A girl can dream.) I leave with broccoli, an artichoke, brussels sprouts, green bell peppers, green onions, asparagus, spinach, serrano peppers, shishito peppers, sweet onion, lemons, limes, chicken, ground turkey, crab fingers, brown cinnamon sugar oatmeal, quinoa, chia seeds, tortilla chips, edamame hummus, eggs, Siggi's yogurt, blackberries, raspberries, a six-pack of Dallas Blonde beer, lime and passionfruit La Croix, a few grapefruit Topo Chicos, and a few bottles of Holy Kombucha. Like I said... I love the grocery store. $110 2 p.m. — I live right next to a Trader Joe's, so I pop in there on my way home to get fresh flowers. This is by far one of my most frivolous indulgences, but I can't help it. It takes me back to when I spent a semester in Germany and my host mother would always have fresh flowers from her garden. Instant happiness. I grab three bouquets and decide I'll mix them and make my own at home. I also can't pass up a bag of blood oranges. $15 2:30 p.m. — I am literally starving and have purchased enough food to host a small Thanksgiving. I live alone, so it really hits me when I over-purchase, but I bring my lunch to work every day. I heat up jasmine rice I already have in the freezer from TJ's, and cook up broccoli to eat with it. I constantly joke about becoming a vegetarian because I'm too lazy to prepare meat. After my raging hunger is cured, I get to meal prepping. I add taco seasoning I already had to the ground turkey, and mix it with onion and serrano peppers. I also make a stir-fry with chicken, egg, onion, serrano, and teriyaki. I craft my flower arrangements and realize it's basically dinnertime, so I sauté the crab fingers in butter and heat up asparagus risotto from TJ's. 9 p.m. — I wash my face with Fresh Soy Face Cleanser, exfoliate, apply Fresh Face Serum, add some Bobbi Brown Hydrating Eye Cream, watch several episodes of , and call it a night.

"8:30 a.m. — It's Monday, but it's a holiday, so I have the day off. I ice roll, make a bowl of brown cinnamon sugar oatmeal, throw raspberries and blackberries in a bowl, and curl up in my reading chair by the window. I crack the balcony door open and start a new book that I just got on Amazon: Adam Grant's . Rain and a new book are the two best smells ever. 11 a.m. — My friend, H., texts me and asks if I know anyone who would want to go to Colorado with him...Hello! Me! (Insert girl-raising-hand emoji.) So we book our flights, and today is already the best (minus the gaping hole in my wallet now). I can excuse the absurdly priced ticket because my family grew up near Vail, and we still have my grandmother's childhood home there. It is truly my favorite place in the world and I can't wait to share this part of my life with H. $690 1 p.m. — Feeling super poor but also super amped. I watch highlight reels from the Olympics and one of my favorite snowboarding documentaries: . Then tacos for lunch. Feeling thankful that I meal prepped yesterday. 3:30 p.m. — This rainy day has me feeling super cozy, so I text a friend to see if she wants to catch the current exhibit at the Dallas Museum of Art. She does! I swing by and grab her and we make it just in time to get tickets. The exhibit right now is Yayoi Kusama: All the Eternal Love I Have for the Pumpkins. I'm a member here (so our tickets are free) and have seen the exhibit several times, but it's my friend's first time seeing it and she is in awe. We swing by some works that feel like old friends: a couple Monets, Picassos, and Pollocks. It's a quick trip, but I missed her, and we catch up and vow to never go this long without seeing each other again. She was my first friend at college. Crazy how lucky you get with friendships sometimes. 5:30 p.m. — Drop her off, drive home, and heat up stir-fry real quick because I have pilates at 6:30 (which I booked it on ClassPass, so it's no charge). I see why people are so on this meal prep kick. Makes saving money so much easier! I'm kind of sore from my run yesterday and am excited to stretch it out, but also afraid of doing pilates on sore muscles. My favorite instructor is teaching, though, and I go at this time every Monday. Keeps me sane. 9 p.m. — My body love-hates me. I take a hot shower and blow-dry my hair so my morning self will thank me tomorrow. It's going to be an early morning because there's a pitch that came in over the long weekend that's due EOD tomorrow. I do my Fresh and Bobbi Brown routine and then I'm out. Daily Total: $690",2,32
"6:15 a.m. — I am a perpetual snoozer...and I truly don't think I will ever change. I snooze until I'm conscious enough to remember why I have to be at work early. I hop out of bed, make it, and turn on my Illy espresso machine so it can heat up while I pick an outfit. Throw a pod in the machine, add half a Splenda, froth the milk, and my espresso is ready and heavenly. Makeup, outfit, and I'm out the door. It takes me about 15 minutes to get to work, even though I only live about three and a half miles from my office. That's downtown Dallas for you. 7 a.m. — At my desk and seriously wishing I had done some work yesterday (said no one ever). This pitch is going to be more than any of us bargained for. I get all of the info I need from the guys on the team and get started on compiling all of the pieces I'll need to create to get this ready for them. I hardly have time to think about eating breakfast today, but Siggi's yogurt to the rescue. 2 p.m. — This day has gotten away from me, but I take about 15 minutes to eat some of my stir-fry. The brain break is good and just the pick-me-up I need. 7:15 p.m. — Finally home. I completed what was needed for today and am thankful I work with such great people who pull through on crazy deadlines. I'm past hunger, so I eat a handful of turkey pepperoni, plus broccoli and jasmine rice. Then I watch and call it a night. Daily Total: $0",3,32
"5:30 a.m. — I have SoulCycle at 6 a.m. Brush teeth, throw on clothes, grab a water and my SoulCycle shoes. (I broke down and bought my own pair, because paying $3 each time to rent shoes adds up.) SoulCycle isn't on ClassPass, so I have to pay. $30 7 a.m. — Home and feeling pretty proud that it's hardly 7 a.m. and I've already burned 650 calories. I have oatmeal, a protein shake, and fruit, and then shower. Afterwards, I ice roll, get ready quickly, and arrive at work at 8. 12:30 p.m. — Pretty standard day. I need to take photos of a building downtown for a project I'm working on, so I drive over there, park, and pay the meter with a mobile parking app I have on my phone ($0.50). My friend M. works in the building, so we grab Snappy Salads ($12) and catch up about the weekend, even though we spent most of it together. I head back to my office. $12.50 3 p.m. — I have a press check at our local printer for an internal project we're doing. I'm getting cards embossed and we're checking to make sure the emboss turns out like it should. They look great and I'm super excited to see the final product. I pay $1 for parking. $1 6 p.m. — Afternoon is smooth and I'm home by 6. I do a load of laundry, mop, and vacuum. I usually do this on the weekends, but lately they have been so jam-packed I haven't had time. 7:45 p.m. — I make a spinach salad, do my skin routine, work on a freelance project I'm doing, and call it an early night. Daily Total: $43.50",4,32
"7 a.m. — I'm not working out this morning, so I snooze until 7. I'm oddly awake (probably due to the nine-ish hours of sleep I got last night), so I opt for chamomile tea instead of coffee. 8 a.m. — I'm at my desk by 7:45. My schedule at work is pretty flexible, but I tend to get there between 7:30 and 8. My boss and I eat oatmeal together and try fun, new fresh fruits we find (one of our morning rituals when time allows). She's hilarious and I love this time with her before the frenzy of the day starts. 2 p.m. — I take a quick second to heat up taco meat with cheese. I never said this life was glamorous. 6:30 p.m. — Finally home. I have a date tonight and my day was so hectic I haven't even had a chance to be nervous about it! It's with a guy, R., who I've been seeing, but with both of our busy schedules, we don't get to see each other too much. He tells me it's my turn to pick. I choose a new French restaurant I know he'll love. I've only been for drinks, so I'm excited to see how the food compares. 7:30 p.m. — He picks me up at 7:30. I called ahead to get a reservation, but the earliest one was 9:30, so we just sit at the bar (which is honestly better for people-watching anyway). The sommelier talks us into a Moroccan red and we're feeling kind of adventurous. I get the ricotta gnocchi with prosciutto, and R. gets the duck. It's fun to finally see him after such a hectic week. R. always picks up the tab. (This semi-annoys me, but really it's just his giving and considerate nature, which are two qualities I really like about him.) 10:30 p.m. — We laugh until we cry and can honestly keep going for hours, but I have a super early morning, so R. drops me off and I embark on my usual nightly routine. Daily Total: $0",5,32
"5:30 a.m. — Seriously regretting booking this 6 a.m. SoulCycle class, but you bet I'm going because I paid $30 for it. SoulCycle always gets me when I need it most. It may be cultish and excessive and overpriced, but it is also a supportive community. This instructor always closes out his upbeat classes with a slower song and gives us a moment to reflect on why we're here and why we're making the effort to better ourselves. His words this morning hit me just where I need them. $30 7 a.m. — It's a refrigerator omelet morning because: 1. I have time, and 2. I have way too much uncooked food in my fridge. Eggs, onions, green onions, asparagus, spinach, garlic, and serranos later, and I'm thinking I should probably audition for . 8:15 a.m. — At my desk, I sip coffee from the office kitchen. It's Friday and someone brought donuts (cue angels singing). 8:30 a.m. — Another surprise pitch comes in and the day goes by super fast. I munch on whatever I can get my hands on throughout the day, knowing I'll have a big dinner. 7 p.m. — I rush home, shower, and get ready because I'm late for dinner with friends. I haven't seen these girls since we all went on vacation in January, so I'm pretty pumped to (nearly) all be back in one place. 10 p.m. — We try a new sister restaurant to one that we already love, and it lives up to the hype. The drinks and food are great and my friend pays for us to Uber five blocks to a bar (yes...but in our defense, it was raining and we were in heels). The door guy at the bar knows us and greets us with a hug. We see so many people we know, it feels like college. For a big city, Dallas is so unbelievably small. We contemplate going somewhere else, but decide to order pizza and call it a night. I Venmo my friend for the pizza, and Uber the two miles home ($8.50). $60 Daily Total: $90",6,32
"6:30 a.m. — The Arboretum here in Dallas does a members-only early access from 7 a.m. to 9 a.m. The tulip exhibit has just begun and I am so excited to go without there being wild children there, so I set my alarm to make it happen. 6:50 a.m. — I'm up and out the door, book and yoga mat in tow. I head to my favorite coffee shop to grab a coffee – it's about 65 and sunny (the holy grail of Dallas weather). I order a small skinny vanilla latte and get a box of organic raspberries. Call my mom and dad and then my grandparents on my way, the only five people I know up at this hour. My parents live pretty close and we talk every day, but one of my grandmas lives in another state and my other grandma and papa live several hours away, so our morning calls are one of my favorite parts of the day. $12 7:20 a.m. — I get to the Arboretum, and since I'm a member, admission and parking are free. In two hours, this place will be a literal madhouse. I throw out my yoga mat in my favorite spot overlooking the lake and do a couple quick salutations to get in the right headspace. I do self-reflecting on 2018 thus far and am thankful I made this time for myself. This moment brings me back to when I went on a solo trip to Seattle for my 25th birthday, and I'm reminded how much moments of independence mean to me in a world where solitude is so often regarded as loneliness. It's taken me a long time to get to this point, but I can't help but smile at how far I've come. 9:30 a.m. — I almost forget I'm meeting a couple friends for SoulCycle at 11:45, so I make a quick run to Central Market. I'm heading to Colorado next week, so I grab the weekly essentials. I call my brother and we catch up on each other's weekends. He's jealous I'm going snowboarding, but we throw around dates for a weekend we can take all of our friends to the house this summer. He's only two years younger than me and we went to the same college, so we're very close. He is truly the most hilarious, intelligent, genuine, witty, and effortlessly genuine person I know and I am honestly much cooler because I am his sister. I pray he ends up in Dallas after he finishes graduate school. $30 10:30 a.m. — I have about an hour to kill before SoulCycle. I always have my ENO Hammock (Christmas gift from my brother) in my car, so I drive over to my favorite spot to continue my book while laying in my hammock. This has already been the best day, and it's hardly begun! 11:45 a.m. — Time to cycle! My two friends have never been before, so it's always exciting for me to have a hand in exposing people I care about to something that has given me so much in the last year. One friend opts for earplugs. She's a grandma in a 30-year-old's body and I absolutely love it. She tells me about a supper club she and her husband are in and says I should join next week. I am ecstatic and touched to be included. $30 1 p.m. — I am literally famished by the time class ends, so we walk next door to get poke bowls. I cannot pass up spicy tuna with bamboo rice! This place is so absurdly priced, but worth it. I also get a yuzu lemonade. We sit outside and enjoy the heat of the sun on our skin. $15 1:30 p.m. — I get a phone call from my friend who I'm meeting for coffee. She wants to go to the coffee shop I went to this morning. It's one of my favorite places in Dallas, so I oblige. This time I try a charcoal latte, because it's new and I can't pass up a trendy over-priced latte. I say bye to my friend and we decide to book Pilates for tomorrow at 2:30. My body is hesitant after SoulCycle, but my brain wins. I'm on ClassPass, so it doesn't cost me anything outside of my monthly fee. $6 2:30 p.m. — I go with a friend to see . She gets the tickets and I get the popcorn and drinks. The movie is incredible: beautifully executed and compositionally alluring. I'm somewhat socially-drained and super tired from my early wake-up call, so ya girl heads home for a nap. $20 7 p.m. — I wake up to a million missed calls from several friends. I had hopes of staying in tonight, but it doesn't look like that's going to be received very well. Because I live alone, I'm always touched by the friends who reach out to me. It's so easy to get lost in the shuffle unintentionally, that the added effort motivates me to shower and get ready. 8:30 p.m. — I Uber to meet some friends at the Truck Yard. It's the coolest place – all outdoor seating with multiple food trucks, which is great for a group of friends that can't decide what to eat. I order two beers and my friend grabs me a hot dog. I take one bite and instantly regret the hot dog, but eat it anyway because I'm so hungry. I finish my beer and head to meet another group of friends. $25 10 p.m. — They're just wrapping up dinner, so I sit for a bit and catch up with everyone. The group is comprised of my closest college friends, and my heart might just burst, I'm so happy to be with all of them. We go back to my friend's apartment, drink beer, and then go to the rooftop of a new hotel that just opened. We run into guys we met on a cruise in college (how strange!) and we catch up on what all's been going on. The views are dazzling and I'm taken back in time as we sip gin and tonics. $15 12 a.m. — We stop at one more bar. I order a tequila neat, which has been my recent go-to, but the combo of the nights' other drinks has me wishing I opted for water. A couple of us have an early morning, so I ditch the drink (ugh, what a waste) and Uber home ($7.50). I wash my face, add my serums, and chug a glass of water before going to bed. $20 Daily Total: $173",7,32
"7 a.m. — Wake up super late because I know my main boss won't be in until after 10. I peacefully lie in bed until 8 and then force myself to shower and make a tuna salad for lunch. I always tell myself I'll make my lunch the night before, but I have literally never done it. 9:10 a.m. — I almost always take the bus to and from work, but it's sleeting and I'm just not feeling it. I call an Uber on my dad's American Express – I'm the only one he's not making car payments for, and he's a freak about safety when it comes to commuting, so he's let me keep his card on my account (I swear I only use it occasionally). It really has helped me out. ($9.11 expensed) 9:35 a.m. — I always make a pot of coffee before I leave the house, but sometimes I'm honestly too lazy to fill the pot. These past few days have really gotten to me (a.k.a. I hate my job), so I just decide to say ""yolo"" and buy Starbucks for me and my coworker. We're both pretty good about picking stuff up for each other when we go out so we never really worry about Venmo-ing. I usually get full from coffee, so I eat my banana from home back at the office. $7.70 12:45 p.m. — Eat my tuna salad and cucumbers from home for lunch. I normally try to socialize with my coworkers during lunch, but I'm currently on the job hunt, so I stay back at my desk to send networking emails (and also get distracted reading Money Diaries). 4:45 p.m. — This day will not end, and I am starving. I brought tons of fruit, but of course I go downstairs to get honey mustard-and-onion pretzel nubs from the vending machine to sustain me for my two-hour language class at 6. They're SO addicting, but I immediately regret them once I finish the bag. The usual. $1.25 8 p.m. — Class is finally over and I'm drained. I go over to my coworker's place, who's also my friend-with-benefits. I don't know how often is too often to see him, but we just started hooking up, so I'm just going with it. We drink wine, vent, catch up on , and pass out. Daily Total: $8.95",1,33
"7:50 a.m. — We absolutely could not get out of bed this morning, so I call a Lyft from his house, as I accept that I'm definitely going to be late into the office and make a mental note to start waking up early enough to catch the bus if our relationship is going to continue this way. My house is two miles away from a metro stop, so I'm pretty dependent on rideshares but try to bike most places when it's not winter. $8.78 9:10 a.m. — I'm supposed to be in at 9, and my boss is PSYCHOTIC, so I text my coworker to let him know that I'll be a bit late ""because of the bus."" I inhale sweet potatoes and an avocado while waiting for the bus. 12:15 p.m. — Unclear if it's because I didn't eat last night or because work has already been heck today, but I am famished. I have a lot of food guilt when I eat unhealthily (a.k.a. wine and M&M's for dinner), so I go buy a Chop't salad, my weakness, and accept that my whole saving money thing is just not going to work out this week. $11.94 2 p.m. — There's leftover cookies and coffee at work from a conference, so naturally my coworkers and I rush to the free food. 5:15 p.m. — Metro to a networking happy hour over by the Hill that I am very underwhelmed for. I meet my friend halfway and we catch up on life, since it's been a while. All the drinks are free (the only reason people go), so we end up having a blast and drinking way too much wine. I pick up a few business cards of new faces and consider it a successful night. 7:30 p.m. — I'm more than a little tipsy from the wine because I'm a lightweight, and I Uber to FWB's house, despite telling myself I would absolutely not let him become my drunk booty call just yet. (Realistically, though, this was bound to happen.) The train is literally right next to my pick-up and destination, so I scold myself for Ubering once I'm in the car. Drunk me doesn't always make the most money savvy decisions. FWB is a sweet boy and lets me talk his ear off before giving me a bite to eat and letting me crash. $8.09 Daily Total: $28.81",2,33
"9 a.m. — We woke up probably a thousand times during the night and into the morning and are now shocked at just how late we are to work. I normally go in later on Fridays because my bosses don't come in, so I'm off the hook there. FWB rushes to get ready and I thank the Lord that I'm not hungover. He lets me stay in bed until I need to leave for work, so I sleep for another hour before walking to the office. 11:45 a.m. — I am FAMISHED. I stole some of FWB's crackers this morning, but two days in a row of not eating dinner is really getting to me. I go buy a massive tuna salad wrap and chips in the cafeteria. $7.09 3 p.m. — The day has passed terribly slowly, but I'm supposed to go meet an old boss on the Hill for a life catch-up. I metro over there and he immediately says we're going on a beer run for his staff meeting at 4 (because that's normal). We catch up on the walk and then hang out in his office for a few hours after his meeting, drinking beer and talking about life. I explain my job situation to him (that my current boss is rude and doesn't think women can do literally anything), and he gives me some advice. It's great to see him. I call my dad on the way back to the train to fill him in before heading home. 7 p.m. — I decided at the beginning of the week that this weekend would be a do-absolutely-nothing weekend, and I am pumped. I've been out of town for the past two weekends and feel like I've literally had no down time since January. I help my roommate get ready for her date (she's a serial dater, in the nicest way possible), and make small talk with him when he shows up a bit too early. I do a face mask, catch up on , and fall asleep around midnight full of Trader Joe's edamame, olives, and tortilla chips. (10/10 would not recommend these together, but I'm low-key hormonal, hence why I was craving this combo.) Daily Total: $7.09",3,33
"7:30 a.m. — I wake up super early because FWB and I made plans to hang out this weekend as long as we're both productive in the morning. At 8:30 I force myself to do some spring cleaning. At the end of it all, my room is cleaner than it's ever been, my laundry is done, I'm finally unpacked from my trips, and I am EXHAUSTED. 2 p.m. — UberPool to FWB's house for our planned lazy day, and I am so excited. I didn't think we'd see each other this often, but I feel less guilty about it because my best friends all either have family in town or are away this weekend. FWB and I normally hang out together in groups on the weekend anyways, only now it just involves a bit more ... lol. Unfortunately, I make the mistake of Ubering instead of taking the bus, thinking it would be quicker, and it takes twice as long to get there. $5.82 2:45 p.m. — Finally make it and he's about to kill me out of hangriness. We go to the store to buy the necessities for a lazy weekend: crescent rolls, Lit'l Smokies, chips, guac, and a huge bottle of wine. I Venmo him for three quarters of it because he always buys our food without asking for me to pay him back, so I definitely owe him more than half. $15 3:30 p.m. — Luckily it's just cold enough to not be outdoors, so we feel less guilty for being lazy. We drink way too much wine, eat a ton of pigs in a blanket, and hang out until 10 p.m. We planned to smuggle wine into a movie, but I fall dead asleep around 11 before that can happen. Daily Total: $20.82",4,33
"1 p.m. — Okay I never sleep this late, just so it's clear. I hate wasting the day! But we barely slept last night, and this morning, daylight savings time hits us hard. Plus we've never had the chance to just do nothing together, and I'm a big fan. We finally motivate ourselves to get up over the course of an hour after really comprehending just how lazy we have been, and make a to-do list to salvage the rest of the day. 2 p.m. — I need to start bringing lunch to work instead of buying, so I head to Trader Joe's to stock up on lunch food (even though I hate how crowded Sundays always are there). It's my mom's birthday, so I Facetime with her while I walk and make a mental note to send her flowers at work next week. Normally I love going all out on gifts, but my sisters and I spent way more than we could afford for her Christmas gift, so we're kind of giving ourselves a pass this year. 2:30 p.m. — At TJ's, I buy enough for a week's worth of Buddha bowls in an effort to be healthy. Plus stuff for turkey wraps, as well as kombucha (which I've recently tried to make more of a habit of drinking). I didn't expect to spend this much money, but I bought a bunch of produce, so I'm not that surprised ($52.11). I Uber home because I'm nowhere near a good bus route ($10.97). $63.08 4 p.m. — After lounging around and helping my roomie out with cover letters, I convince myself to go to the gym because I have literally been immobile all weekend. 6:30 p.m. — I feel SO much better now, but am also dead and have not even started studying for my language class's final tomorrow. It'll probably be a late night, but I haven't been sleeping well anyways so I just accept it and take my time cooking. I eat, do a mask, and Facebook stalk four people before finally studying until 1 a.m. Daily Total: $63.08",5,33
"6:30 a.m. — I am dead. It's dark when I wake up and I absolutely cannot get out of bed until the very last second. I sprint through getting ready and throw a turkey wrap together with a bottle of kombucha for lunch. We have a work happy hour tonight, and then I have my test. I know I'm gonna end up at FWB's house, so I throw extra work clothes in my purse and barely make the bus. 9:10 a.m. — I munch on my TJ's yogurt and chug my coffee while trying to pacify my already angry boss. Everyone's here, which never happens on Mondays, and I can already tell this day is going to be real rough. 10:30 a.m. — I break open my Goldfish for a mid-morning snack. I've been trying to eat healthier, but this is one thing I cannot shake. I eat way too many fish and already feel the heartburn coming. 12:15 p.m. — I cram for my final exam during my lunch break and enjoy the peace and quiet of an empty office. My wrap's good, but I definitely regret not bringing more food. The past few weeks I've haven't had much of an appetite due to the stress of work, so I take it as a good sign that I'm still hungry after lunch, and make a mental note to buy more Goldfish at CVS this week. 2:30 p.m. — I am slowly dying. I am a caffeine addict, but I despise our Keurig coffee, so I usually try to avoid it during the afternoons. I really want to go grab a cappuccino but find an apple in my desk to distract me from spending money. Counting down the hours until tonight's happy hour. 5 p.m. — I know it's a bad idea to drink before my final, but if you don't know a language when you're drunk, do you really know it? I grab a margarita from my coworker's pitcher and fill up on chips and guac. It's nice to hang out with everyone outside of the office, but also a bit stressful, so I'm not that disappointed when I have to leave. Plus, I really don't need to be marg drunk on a Monday. 6:10 p.m. — Run to my test that starts in five minutes! Whoops. I'm slightly buzzed, but really don't care too much. By the time we take the test, I'm completely sobered up. It was a BREEZE. Honestly, I could've had an entire pitcher of margs. 7:30 p.m. — Most of my coworkers are still at happy hour, so I head back to the bar. One of the girls just found out she got passed up for a promotion by an outside hire, and she is distraught, so we plan to move to another bar to drink and vent about how much we hate our jobs. Once we start moving, though, her husband picks her up and we take it as a sign that we should call it a night, seeing as most people are drunk by now anyways. 8:15 p.m. — FWB and I try to sneak back to his house without our coworkers seeing. It really doesn't help that he lives next to three of them, but we manage to Uber separately and pull it off. $5.29 8:30 p.m. — He's pretty drunk, so we chat and drink a little red wine while he fills me in on what I missed at the happy hour while I was taking my test. There's always drama at my work, because, frankly, it's pretty poorly managed. But hey, at least things are always interesting. We pass out around midnight, but I barely sleep for some reason. Daily Total: $5.29",6,33
"7:50 a.m. — I force myself out of his bed to shower before he gets up. He can get ready in 15 minutes, but my hair is way too thin to not shower in the morning (and dry shampoo just makes it worse). I climb back into bed post-shower and we sleep until 8:40 when we realize that we actually do have to show up to work, despite our best efforts to pretend we don't. 9 a.m. — We walk to work and it is FREEZING. Thankfully we manage to avoid any coworkers when we arrive together. I have a granola bar at my desk, but I'm starving and a bit hungover from the wine, so I splurge and buy an omelet from our cafeteria. $5.95 11 a.m. — Honestly I'm not even hungry, yet somehow I'm eating Goldfish again. I have the strangest meeting of my life with a colleague, and am brutally reminded of why I have to find a new job soon. Our work environment is toxic. 12:30 p.m. — I go to lunch but am still not hungry yet, thanks to the omelet. We all share our March Madness bracket picks, and I set a reminder on my phone to finish mine tonight. I don't keep up with college basketball any other time of the year, but I LOVE March Madness. After an hour of avoiding going back to our desks, we finally make moves. Luckily I have a TJ's salad I left in the fridge yesterday, and I scarf it down while going through emails. 3:30 p.m. — I cave and use the Keurig for the meeting I'm about to sit through. I just signed up for a cycling class tonight, though, so I'm telling myself to only have one cup. 4 p.m. — The meeting was POINTLESS and now I think I'm even more tired than I was before.  I'm really regretting signing up for this class, but the $5 no show charge is motivating me to not bail. 5 p.m. — Sprint to the bus from work to make it home to get changed before class. I tell myself I'm way more fit than I think I am (which is a lie), and walk to my first spin class. 7 p.m. — I am dead, literally dead. My legs are jello and what on earth is going on with my butt. My dad does this on the reg and so does my best friend, and now I literally think they are crazy. I strategically sat in the back during class, but the instructor could still see everything. What a day. Hopefully I worked off the wine, though. 7:45 p.m. — Shower and make a Buddha bowl to continue on Day One of my health streak. I bought frozen carrot spirals from TJ's, and I am obsessed. I should be doing my language homework right now, so I kind of read over my vocab while actually catching up on .  Tuesday's are hard. 11 p.m. — I could've gone to bed HOURS ago, but here I am. I pop melatonin because I've been having trouble staying asleep, and try not to think of how drowsy I'm going to be in the morning. Daily Total: $5.95",7,33
"7:30 a.m. — I get woken up by heavy construction noise outside. Somehow, I manage to fall back asleep. I stayed up until 2:30 a.m. last night perusing the shopping guide for a Bergdorf Goodman beauty event. (I only found out about it when a last-minute announcement hit my inbox just before midnight.) I rarely shop for skincare products, but the big discount was enticing. I ended up passing on the sale, though, because I just can't justify casually spending $1,000. 9 a.m. — I get woken up again, this time by my neighbor slamming his door. He does this all the time, so I always know when he leaves or comes home. We never say hi to each other in the hallway. Awkward. 10 a.m. — Get ready for work. I left my corporate job last year to pursue entrepreneurship with a group of friends. We run a hospitality management start-up, so our hours are irregular. I'm on call around the clock, but in return I get a flexible schedule and choice of work locations. 10:30 a.m. — I recently changed my makeup look to a warmer tone, which feels refreshing and makes my morning routine more exciting. I'm wearing Tom Ford's Cream and Powder Eye Color today, which I splurged on with a $50 Bloomingdales gift card last week. The golden peach color is dazzling. 11 a.m. — Subway to work. 11:30 a.m. — I snack on chocolate with a glass of soy milk while spending way too much time browsing food delivery websites for lunch ideas. I keep a handful of chocolate bars at work, and our office building provides free coffee, milk, and beers. 12 p.m. — I text my coworker to check if he's okay with Thai food for lunch. All our meals are treated by the owners, but I do the ordering because everyone trusts my foodie instincts. ($34.94 expensed) 1:30 p.m. — Food arrives and so does my coworker, so we eat together. My pad woon sen comes with a variety of vegetables. The colorful dish makes me happy. 2 p.m. — My compensation package is finalized – I got the raise I wanted! This is no small triumph, because I tend to avoid confrontation. I immediately share the good news with my family and my best friend over text. 4 p.m. — My friend sends over housing options to help me out with moving. I can no longer tolerate the peeling paint and rampant mice in my current apartment, and I need to move out. I also have vacation on the mind – my family is spread out across the world, so we try to plan something special together every year. 6 p.m. — I go home to shower and relax. Then I watch YouTube videos while doing chores. I like self-help videos and motivational speeches, as well as cooking tutorials and travel videos. 7 p.m. — I eat marinated soft-boiled egg and frozen roasted sweet potatoes for dinner. I also finish up leftover bone broth with mushroom and goji berries that I made last weekend. I'm a decent cook and used to experiment with a lot of different recipes, but I have gradually reduced my cooking in favor of socializing more. 9 p.m. — To aid in my lunch decision-making, I sign up for a catering service for the rest of the week. I recently got hooked on this catering service that delivers to Manhattan office buildings from different restaurants. 11 p.m. — I read Money Diaries for ideas on what to do with my new-found wealth from my raise until I fall asleep.

"9 a.m. — I wake up feeling like a millionaire. Financial freedom is empowering! 12 p.m. — I receive a text notification that my lunch has arrived, so I leave the office to look for the truck. Today's lunch is Taiwanese bento boxes, and my pick is stewed pig's trotter with lotus root in a fermented bean curd sauce, which is served with white rice and cabbage. I order for two coworkers but only one of them shows up, so I save the extra food for later. ($47 expensed) 1 p.m. — While I was waiting in the pickup line, a guy walking by asked me about the truck and, after we talked for a minute, he gave me his business card. When I get back to my desk, I email him a link to the catering service's website. He had a cute French accent and was quite friendly, so I secretly hope to strike up more conversations with him. 4 p.m. — More coworkers swing by the office. Most people in my company work out in the field, so we only rent a miniscule space for office use. The noise makes it hard to concentrate, but it's also interesting to hear updates about other projects. 6 p.m. — I go with the team to a ping pong bar, but when we get there, all the ping pong tables are reserved. We decide to just look around and chill out with food and drinks. We thoroughly enjoy the short rib poutine and pulled pork sliders but get a little overwhelmed by the ricotta cheese on the flatbread. My coworkers indulge in beer and apple cider while I attempt to fit in with my sparkling water. I may not appreciate the taste of alcohol, but I certainly get the spirit! 9 p.m. — I leave the group with one other coworker. We chat a bit more about work and life on the subway before going our separate ways. I get home feeling still slightly hungry, so I eat a coconut-mango Nounos yogurt that I've been craving and a banana that's about to get too ripe. 11:30 p.m. — I watch eyeshadow palette review videos on YouTube to research for my next purchase. I have worn little-to-no makeup all my life, but I've had a passion for eyeshadow and lip color recently. But I need to know all my options before making any commitment, and that applies to eyeshadow palettes my life partner. This is such a strenuous task that I pass out before buying anything. Daily Total: $0",2,34
"9 a.m. — It's taken a few days, but I finally come around to unboxing a package from Express I ordered last week. I got four clothing items, a pair of heart-shaped sunglasses, and pink sneakers for summer during a site-wide sale ($126.15). I try everything on and decide to keep two black tops as well as the shoes and sunglasses. The other stuff either doesn't look flattering my body or I don't love the colors. 11:30 a.m. — There is leftover dessert from yesterday's lunch in the office fridge – taro and tapioca in sweet coconut milk. I know I'm about to have lunch, but this will spoil fast, so I feel obligated to prioritize it. Pre-lunch dessert it is! 12:30 p.m. — I grab food from the same catering service as yesterday. Today's menu is spicy hot pot with sliced fatty beef and assorted vegetables. I particularly love the springy sweet potato vermicelli that soaks up all the flavors of the soup. My coworker eats his in tears because of the spicy level. I make a mental note to get him something less spicy next time. ($24.98 expensed) 7 p.m. — I head home with the remainder of yesterday's lunch leftovers. My coworkers despise leftover food, but I can't bring myself to throw out perfectly good food. I feel that I owe it to the plants/animals that sacrificed their lives and the people that prepared the food with time, effort, and care. 7:30 p.m. — I get home, shower, and set my dinner on the table: leftover baked chicken with a peach-passion fruit Nounos yogurt and an apple. After posing my yogurt with props in the right lighting and finding a satisfactory angle and distance for the picture, I am able to eat my dinner in peace. (Did I mention I have to take a picture of everything I eat? Otherwise it's like I didn't eat it, right?) 11 p.m. — I'm making an effort to go to bed earlier, which is hard due to the nature of my industry. My skin used to be better when I went to bed by 10 p.m. I purposefully refrained from coffee and tea today, so I am able to fall asleep relatively quickly. Daily Total: $0",3,34
"11 a.m. — A friend reminds me of Japan Week at Grand Central, so I detour to check it out. My monthly MetroCard has expired, so I have to pay for the single trip fare. $2.75 11:40 a.m. — It takes no time to look through the exhibition. I am disappointed that there's only one food vendor at the event this year. I believe that food is the best way to share culture. It brings people together, which is why I dedicate my life to it. 12 p.m. — I pick up three meals from the lunch catering service. Spicy hot pot again because I can't get enough of all-in-one meals. ($32 expensed) 2 p.m. — My coworkers still haven't shown up for their food. I text to find out that they are not coming. Friday is my field work day, so I bring the food to share with people there. They gladly accept it. 4 p.m. — I finish work early, and it's a beautiful Friday afternoon, so I accept my coworker's invitation to go get dessert. We go to a fancy place where they serve a three-course all-dessert meal. I have known about this place for ages, but the idea of dessert after dessert always seemed excessive to me. The meal turns out extraordinarily light and refreshing – we even ordered two extra main courses (of desserts). What a promising start for my weekend! The total bill is around $75, and my coworker/friend pays in return for my treat a while back. 5:30 p.m. — I go to Express to return the unwanted clothes. I still want something real for dinner, so I walk over to Koreatown to get kimchi – I'm craving something crisp and pungent. This seems like a good occasion to order a mung bean pancake as well, which is usually too substantial to accompany an entrée. $16.33 6 p.m. — My brother texts me from across the world while I'm waiting for my takeout. I immediately turn into a six-year-old girl who jumps for joy when her big brother shows affection. 7 p.m. — I get home and eat my takeout with a little more of the leftover chicken from yesterday. 10 p.m. — I saw on social media that one of my acquaintances has two lovely Ragdolls. I've been considering getting a Ragdoll myself, so I talk to her and learn a ton about the breed. 11 p.m. — I listen to podcasts about intuitive eating until I fall asleep. I'm aware that I've had a somewhat distorted relationship with food ever since I started dieting around age 17. Being so preoccupied with food all the time has led me to miss out more important things in life, and I am hoping I can restore my relationship with it. Daily Total: $19.08",4,34
"9 a.m. — I stalk my favorite lifestyle blogger on Instagram. She just started a 100-day workout challenge to embrace a more active lifestyle. I consider whether I should sign up for the gym as well. I give up the thought quickly – I would enjoy playing sports much more, so I consider picking up some kind of racquet sport. 11 a.m. — I see pictures of brunches on Instagram, so that's what I want now. I look up places for eggs benedict around me. I want avocado and hollandaise sauce, bonus points if the bread isn't plain old English muffin. Not a lot of options meet these criteria. I finally settle on a British-style pub right around my block. 12 p.m. — Bummer! The restaurant no longer accepts walk-ins today. I go back home and semi-satisfy my craving with marinated soft-boiled eggs and yogurt. 1 p.m. — I graze on snacks (kimchi, Taiwanese moon cake, a KIND bar, chocolate, and nuts) throughout the day while I read more Money Diaries. I usually spend my free time watching movies, TV, and documentaries, but this is not one of those weekends. 2 p.m. — I remember that the teeth whitening kit I ordered on Amazon should've been delivered yesterday, so I go downstairs and find it. 5 p.m. — I make a Chinese dessert soup with silver ear and lotus root seeds. I also throw in a couple of dried longan fruit for sweetness. I have a dinner plan with a friend at 8, so I cook a piece of frozen crab-stuffed shrimp to hold myself over until then. 8 p.m. — While waiting for my friend in the subway station, I see a cellist who performs there often. He's dressed in a green outfit today and looks super cute, so I give him a tip. He smiles. $1 8:30 p.m. — I am craving spicy chewy noodles, so we go to Koreatown. The restaurant is super busy, and we are asked to give our table (where we have already been seated) to a couple who came and ordered AFTER us because “their food came out first.” I don't understand why this is necessary, given that the table right next to us is literally being cleaned, but we comply and can't help but laugh. I consider leaving a bad review on Yelp, but figure that it wouldn't make a difference anyway. The restaurant doesn't accept multiple credit cards, so I take the opportunity to treat my friend – at least one of us should feel special tonight! $38 9:30 p.m. — We head over to Sephora for some girl fun and walk around the store exchanging knowledge of products we have used or heard about. I don't buy anything, but get some ideas for Sephora's semi-annual sale in April. 11 p.m. — My friend is craving a fruity drink, so we find a cute Korean café. She orders a mango peach smoothie, and I get water because I am not a big fan of sweetened drinks. All the dessert items in the display case looks amazing, but I left my dessert stomach at home after today's snacking. 12 a.m. — I get home and shower just in time to tune into tonight's live episode of this YouTube channel I follow. It mainly features food and travel videos, and tonight's theme is a spicy noodle challenge. The people are very personable, and watching them feels like videochatting with my best friends. I fall asleep near the end. Daily Total: $39",5,34
"12 p.m. — I finally get into the pub for brunch! My custom eggs benedict turns out just okay, but the atmosphere is nostalgic and the waitress very nice, so I'm 100% satisfied. $25 1 p.m. — I hop on the subway for an afternoon meeting at one of our properties. The sunshine is amazing, so I get off one station earlier to walk and take in sunshine. I used to go to school around this area, so the familiar streets bring back memories that put a smile on my face. 2 p.m. — Back-to-back meetings. My team and I learn a lot of things that are important for our future developments. 8 p.m. — My coworkers send me home with leftover soup and yummy seaweed and mushroom salad. I take a stroll around Union Square and then return to my neighborhood. 10 p.m. — I chat with friends on the phone and make plans for next weekend. This has been a fulfilling week. I go to sleep with a positive outlook for next week. Daily Total: $25",6,34
"8 a.m. — I wake up to find a Delivery.com promo in my inbox. I can place four orders this month and get $10 off. That's a good deal, but I am not sure I can squeeze that much takeout in such a short time. I save the email anyway. 9 a.m. — I get to work earlier than usual, and — surprise! — the building is providing catered fried chicken, waffles, and omelets today. 10 a.m. — My coworkers get here early too! Our work environment is great and it motivates me. 12 p.m. — Lunch from the catering service is here. The menu today is Mala dry pot with ten thousand ingredients in it. I order for four (and make sure that half of the order isn't spicy), and there happen to be exactly four people here today, so no food goes to waste – yay! One of my coworkers turns on a variety show on YouTube, so we watch together. ($40 expensed) 3 p.m. — I spend the afternoon tackling some issues for our business. I like the problem-solving aspect of entrepreneurship! 4 p.m. — During my down time, I check out fresh deals on FreshDirect. I put off ordering because I don't want to over-order for the sake of meeting the delivery minimum. 5:30 — I head to H-Mart after work. I only intend to grab something light because I'm not very hungry, but I end up with a basket of gorgeous-looking produce: bok choy, tomatoes, oranges, apples, Japanese sweet potatoes, Okinawan sweet potatoes, and sticky corn ($24.13). I also impulse-buy an adorable Totoro keychain in the checkout aisle because Totoro is my favorite cartoon character, and I tell myself that I can always use a spare keychain ($6). $30.13 7 p.m. — I eat a yogurt and a giant Sunkist orange, which I neatly cut into eight pieces to prolong my enjoyment of it. Somehow this works up my appetite, so I snack on more nuts and also microwave sweet potatoes. I like to microwave sweet potatoes because it slightly dries them out and intensifies the sweetness. 12 a.m. — Bedtime. Daily Total: $30.13",7,34
"7:30 a.m. — I oddly wake up an hour before my alarm rings and get ready for work. I'm the first in the office, as everyone somehow has the flu. Luckily, the clinic I work at is above a grocery store and a very well-stocked drug store. I can't resist the urge for chocolate today, so I pop downstairs and get some, as well as gluten-free müsli and almond-rice milk. $7.45 1 p.m. — My boyfriend and I recently made hummus and millet-parsley salad, which I bring today for lunch. I take my lunch break a little early and sit on the fluffy sofas between all of our offices. I notice my boyfriend got a little garlic happy on the salad, but at least I don't have to go buy lunch today. 6 p.m. — I decide to leave work a little early and continue one of my projects at home. I try to cook as many meals as I can at home; I have celiac disease, which is not the easiest in Germany. I go to the grocery store around the corner from my apartment and pick up spinach, bean sprouts, goat cheese, lactose-free milk, and other odds and ends. By the time I finish my work, I'm too tired to cook. Boyfriend eats leftover gluten-free pizza from the weekend, and I just drink some tea because I'm not hungry. $10.86 Daily Total: $18.31",1,35
"7:50 a.m. — I slept terribly last night and wake up on the wrong side of the bed. I get ready quickly for work with my boyfriend. He makes me espresso and steamed milk every morning, which saves me money on coffee. As usual, I forget my thermos at home and I have to turn back and run upstairs. Coffee is life. 10 a.m. — I have about 100 emails when I get to the office. However, since I'm in a grumpy mood, I decide to restock some of my skincare that I've been holding off on rebuying. After filling my cart eight times with different things, I finally decide on Kanebo Moisture Flow Rich Lotion and my signature perfume, which has been empty for a while. Retail therapy always brightens my mood. $137 1 p.m. — Since I was too tired and not feeling well yesterday, I didn't make anything to bring for lunch today. I run down to the supermarket and grab a salmon California roll and yogurt. I always chat with the workers who roll the sushi — they know to make me gluten-free rolls. The  yogurt reminds me of what I used to eat as a kid in the U.S. $8 7 p.m. — I was sick most of last week and my boyfriend was too, so we decide to spend tonight in. Normally on Tuesdays, I go to the gym and he has psychology class, but we both skip. We make a salad for dinner, cuddle up on the couch, and begin to plan our upcoming Japan trip. I'm already thinking of all the Japanese skincare products I'm going to buy there. We're both super tired, and I fall asleep to an audiobook. Daily Total: $145",2,35
"1 p.m. — The day has flown by. I have some deadlines and backed up emails from missing work last week. I eat a jar of salad that I made last night, and then run downstairs and buy a couple of a things, including a large bottle of water since I am incapable of drinking the right amount of fluid. $4 7 p.m. — I meet up with a friend to go to the gym. After having the flu for approximately two weeks, I am thrilled to finally be able to move around again. She isn't feeling so well, so we take it easy on the elliptical machines and chat. She's actually joining my company in two months, so we exchange office gossip. (I used to work at her old company.) She drives me home and we go to a small Venezuelan hole-in-the-wall arepa shop next to my apartment. Due to the lack of gluten-free options in Hamburg, I am a regular here. I get two arepas with black beans and plantains. I haven't seen her for a while, and I think it's my turn to treat. Arepas and freshly squeezed mango juice are the perfect end to Hump Day. $19 Daily Total: $23",3,35
"9 a.m. — A handyman is coming to repair the floorboards under the heater in our apartment, so my boyfriend and I both work from home for the morning to let him in. We have a breakfast of avocado, cheese, and our favorite: Ei im Glas (soft-cooked egg plopped into a glass with spring onions, fig mustard, salt, pepper, and herbs to garnish). I make an appointment for a 90-minute Thai massage after work ($55), and go into the office around lunchtime. $55 3 p.m. — My perfume and moisturizer have arrived! There's a package station right outside of my work, so I go pick them up. It's 12 degrees here, and I am happy to go home soon, enjoy a massage, take a bath, and hibernate until tomorrow. 8 p.m. — I forgot that I promised to stop by a friend's house tonight to help her with her taxes. Somehow, I have become the German tax expert in my group of friends. I leave the massage super refreshed, shower off, and walk 20 minutes to her apartment. She is making us dinner, so I buy strawberry sorbet for dessert. We catch up, as she has been on vacation for a couple of weeks, and then finish the rest of the entries for her taxes. I take the bus home because it's far too cold to walk. I double cleanse, try the new softener, use my beloved Alpha-H, and squeeze into my bed with my boyfriend. So happy tomorrow is Friday. $6 Daily Total: $61",4,35
"6 a.m. — Boyfriend is still sleeping soundly when I leave for work, so I pick up a coffee on my way to the office to snap out of my pure zombiedom. I take some patients to their treatments, and five hours later I am back at my desk going through my emails. $2.75 1 p.m. — My coworkers and I order poke from a nearby place. I get the truffle tuna bowl. Can't wait for the weekend! $12 5 p.m — I pick up a bottle of wine and vegan gummy bears to take to a friend who is going back to the States on Monday. She comes over to our place, and we talk about going to a birthday party later, but the weather makes us not want to do anything. When 11 p.m. rolls around, we all decide to call it a night and open up another bottle of wine at our place. I whip up gluten-free burrito bowls and make homemade tortillas from ingredients I bought last week. Thick blankets and freshly fried tortillas make for a good night. Wow, winter has turned me into a hermit. Daily Total: $14.75",5,35
"11 a.m. — We sleep in today. I meet the same friend from last night to do last-minute vintage shopping, and find an amazing acid wash denim jumpsuit with rhinestones ($84). I came, I tried it on, and it conquered me. I also return a dress I bought from & Other Stories. It's far too cold to be outside, so we go back to our apartment. $84 5 p.m. — My friend goes home and my boyfriend and I go to a play that friends of ours are acting in. We get there and have a couple glasses of wine. The play starts at 7 p.m., and we sit in the theater bar until then. Drinks and tickets are paid for by our friend, whose family owns the theater. We settle into our seats for the show. 11 p.m. — We're back at the theater bar, taking rounds of vodka shots. I buy a round for everyone. We chill there for a while, then head to one of our favorite bars in the Schanze. We know the bartenders, who give us a discount on drinks. Our apartment is a mere couple of skips away, and we decide to call it a night around 1 a.m., though our friends have a second wave of energy and decide to stay out. As it is still frigid out, I order us a cab ($5) and we're home in four minutes. Sweatpants on, movie on, boyfriend and I out. $45 Daily Total: $129",6,35
"10:30 a.m. — We wake up around 10 and realize one of our friends slept in our guest room. We forgot we gave him the keys last night! I round the boys up, and we make breakfast with leftovers we have. Our traditional Ei im Glas, as well as a couple of salads. Plus, bacon and hot sauce. Perfect hangover food. 3 p.m. — We all settle in on our couch and immerse ourselves in a Netflix binge. Luckily, it's still snowing outside and we're all hungover. Needless to say, no one feels bad about having a day in. Our friend decides only fries will cure his hangover, and I walk to the nearby emergency apothecary and get aspirin for all of us. $5 8 p.m. — Our friend leaves and we continue our lazy day mainly on the couch. We take a quick break and do yoga in our living room, before scrounging up leftovers for our dinner. I've been eyeing a pair of corduroy mom jeans online, and decide to order them. Nothing says obsession like having eight pairs of cord overalls and culottes. I check my work email so I won't have any surprises tomorrow morning. The weekend went by way too fast, and we don't have enough food in the house to meal prep for the week. Oh well. We fall asleep with the lights on at 11 p.m. and wake up bright and early for Monday! $55 Daily Total: $60",7,35
"7 a.m. — I wake up to do last night's dishes and feed the cat, who wakes us up between 7 and 7:30 every morning with her desperate need for attention and food. I make a breakfast of fried egg, avocado, and sliced grapefruit. B. makes a French press with coffee from our monthly subscription. 8:45 a.m. — I head to my first meeting of the day: a networking group that gets together for coffee every Thursday morning. I drink water, since I just had coffee at home. 11 a.m. — The meeting ends and I stop by another coffee shop before driving back to the office. I get a small cappuccino ($3.25) and an everything bagel ($3.10), since I figure this will be my chance to eat lunch. $6.35 3:45 p.m. — After typing away on a report that's due next week, I leave for a dentist appointment because I desperately need to get my wisdom teeth removed. It's just a consultation, so I'm not charged. I also stop for gas on the way. $24.62 5:30 p.m. — I get home and am hungry. I eat the peanut butter and jelly sandwich I was supposed to take for my lunch, and then go about getting the Airbnb ready for the guest we have checking in tomorrow. 7:30 p.m. — My boyfriend gets home and we go on a bike ride to enjoy the 72 degree weather and grab dinner out. He works at a bike shop and just built me a new bike, so we want to test it out. We talk ourselves into a fancy French dinner and share baked brie, Caesar salad, filet mignon, and red wine. I pick up the $120 check. We head home around 10 p.m. to pack for our trip the next day. $120 Daily Total: $150.97",1,36
"7:45 a.m. — We wake up, have a morning romp, and proceed to worry about the cat since she didn't wake us like she usually does, and we've been hearing coyotes in the neighborhood at night. She turns up shortly, though, and all's well. I make a breakfast of sweet potato hash and fried eggs. B. makes the coffee, feeds the cat, and loads up our bags for the trip we're taking this weekend. B.'s running in a race out of town. 9 a.m. — I hop on my bike to head to my first meeting at a coffee shop downtown. I order a Topo Chico since I just had coffee at home. $1.50 12 p.m. — I stick around the coffee shop to work for a while after my meeting, and then bike to the office. When I get in, I eat the peanut butter and jelly I packed for lunch (our fridge was looking pretty empty this morning), along with Thin Mints that a coworker brought. 5:30 p.m. — I leave work and stop at the grocery store for road trip snacks. I get fig bars, Snickers, and a few other things, and try to load it all in my bike basket. $15.59 6:30 p.m. — I arrive home just in time to throw our bags in the car, fill up the cat's food and water, and head to pick B. up from work so we can head straight to our destination. We stop in Tulsa for dinner at a nicer place since it's our first time checking out the town. I'm starting to feel guilty about my impulsive dining habits... $110.39 10 p.m. — We arrive in the town the bike race is in, get everything ready for tomorrow morning, shower, and pass out. Daily Total: $127.48",2,36
"6 a.m. — We rise early so B. can get to his race in time. He eats breakfast at the hotel while I pack up our bags, and leaves to get his registration packet. I mosey into town and stop to get coffee and a breakfast sandwich on the way. $7.13 8 a.m. — Race starts, and that's my cue to explore. I find friends and head towards a coffee shop with the book I brought. I get a cup of tea. $2.94 11 a.m. — We leave to catch the riders at the midpoint, and I stop for gas on the way. $32.49 2 p.m. — I thrown B. his water bottle at the halfway point, and decide to go for a run. After six miles, I'm hungry but want to wait for B. to eat lunch. I stop at a convenience store for a Topo Chico and a bag of chips. $3.26 3 p.m. — I head back to watch the finish and pick up way too many celebratory beers at a local brewery. $30.04 4 p.m. — As I wait for B. to roll across the finish line, I scroll through Airbnb and book us a place for our trip to Atlanta for my sister's engagement party in a few weeks. $212.49 6 p.m. — The race is over and after cleaning up and swapping stories with friends, we grab dinner at a food truck. We each pay for our own meals. We pack up the car for the three-hour ride home and immediately fall asleep when we get there. $17.41 Daily Total: $305.76",3,36
"9 a.m. — We sleep in a little bit this morning, which feels good. I make a breakfast of red potatoes, broccoli, and fried eggs. B. makes the French press, and we drink it while watching episodes of . I think we've both cried during every episode. 12 p.m. — We finish cleaning up the house for the next Airbnb guests. I sign us up for a massage workshop at my yoga studio this afternoon for $25 each. $50 3 p.m. — Massage workshop is over and we run a few errands. We get groceries for a potluck we have later tonight ($25.42), and then stop at Lowe's for air filters and curtain rod holders. (We've had our curtain rod leaning up against my dresser for about three months because I got the wrong size holders.) $64.75 7 p.m. — I prepare the kale salad I'm bringing to the potluck and we head over. We hang around drinking wine and talking until 11:30, then head home, play with the cat, and pass out after sexing. Daily Total: $114.75",4,36
"8 a.m. — I hit snooze a few too many times, so I don't have time to make breakfast, as I have a standing 9 a.m. meeting every Monday. I stop by the drive-through coffee place on the way for a cappuccino and a breakfast taco. $11.94 11 a.m. — Between tasks and meeting, I look up flights for our trip to Atlanta. They're still $345, so I hold off. I'm hoping the prices will go down, but I tend to wait for this to happen and usually all they do is get more expensive. 1 p.m. — I'm pretty involved in local politics, and one of the candidates in my district calls me to ask for support at a fundraiser she's hosting next weekend. I agree to give $250, and log in to her website to submit the donation. $250 2 p.m. — I use my lunch break to grocery shop, since we have friends coming over for dinner tonight. I buy two bottles of wine, ingredients to make jackfruit tacos for four, fruit for breakfast, and ingredients to make a big pot of veggie soup for the week's lunches. $94.98 6 p.m. — I arrive home, take a shower, feed the cat, and start dinner. Our friends arrive at 7:30 and stay until 10. We clean up the house and go to sleep. Daily Total: $356.92",5,36
"7:30 a.m. — Woken up by the cat. I get up to feed her and get ready for work. I prepare a breakfast of yogurt, muesli, banana, and blueberries, and make the coffee this morning since it's B.'s day off. I head into work early. 10 a.m. — I have a meeting at a coffee shop with the crew that I organize an indie craft show with in town. I order a mocha and pick up my colleague's drink order, too. We expense it because we're doing pretty well this year. ($11.39 expensed) 12 p.m. — My lunch meeting gets cancelled, so I go home for lunch to eat leftover tacos. 5 p.m. — I'm home from work and sneak in a quick run and a snack of Fig Newtons before heading to a community meeting at 6 p.m. 8 p.m. — We're both home and I make a Blue Apron bucatini recipe with ingredients that have been sitting around for a week. We catch up on Sunday night TV and head to sleep. Daily Total: $0",6,36
"7 a.m. — I wake up, get ready, and make breakfast tacos with corn tortillas, scrambled eggs, avocado, and salsa. B. goes into work later than me, so I ask him to finish up the Airbnb room before the guests get here at 2 p.m. It's beautiful out, so I ride my bike to work. 12 p.m. — I go home for lunch and eat a random assortment of food including toast with butter, marshmallows, and leftover black beans. As much as I want to say that saving money is my motivation for eating at home, I really love having the escape during the day, since working in an open office as an introvert really drains my energy. 6 p.m. — I head to the coffee shop for my 6 p.m. meeting. I order a Topo Chico and banana bread ($5). My friend and I are organizing a pop-up shop together, and I put the cost of our Squarespace website on my credit card ($144) while we're setting it up. Hopefully we'll make the money back. $149 8 p.m. — I come home and roast potatoes, cabbage, and carrots, and serve it with leftover chicken and a tahini kale salad for dinner. We watch the third movie and eat ice cream afterward. Daily Total: $149",7,36
"7:30 a.m. — As much as I want to sleep in, my body is used to waking me up around 7, *especially* on the weekends. I stayed out last night to grab late-night ramen with my friends and got home around 2. I don't feel particularly tired this morning, but I love sleep, so back to snoozeland I go. 9:30 a.m. — Okay, I guess it's time to get up. I make my usual cup of tea while I lounge with my dog and watch a couple episodes of on Netflix. I plan on going to the gym soon. I don't eat much before going because I like to run a lot, and running on almost empty makes the run easier for me. 11:15 a.m. — I love Sundays at the gym – there's barely anyone here! I'm on an eight-week running plan: Today is the first day of week two, and the plan calls for 36 minutes total on the treadmill. I spend another 45 minutes weight-lifting. My arms are definitely going to be sore tomorrow! 12:45 p.m. — I get back from working out with a dull headache and make myself a strawberry-banana smoothie with almond milk. I'm basically incapable of moving when I have a headache, so I quickly shower and try to nap for a few hours. 5 p.m. — I wasn't very successful, and my headache is even worse now! I eat something, take Advil, and lay down again. 6 p.m. — Finally feeling a little bit better, probably because the Advil kicked in. I usually grocery shop on Sundays, so I search up recipes online and gather my ingredients list. My niece's birthday is on Thursday, and she asked for a new bean bag chair. I scan Target's website and order one for her. $48.70 8:15 p.m. — I have this bad habit of grocery shopping at Trader Joe's on Sundays. If you're a frequent TJ patron, you'd know that Sunday is *literally* the worst day to be there, especially during the afternoon. Today I get there 30 minutes before closing, and it feels surreally empty. I pick up two weeks' worth of food. (I eat eggs for breakfast every single day, and there's a cafeteria at work where I get free lunch every day, so I only worry about dinner). I have this grocery money tracker spreadsheet where I input item, store, and costs whenever I grocery shop to help me budget easier. Basically, I know how much I should be spending going in. (I also tend to buy the same things every time.) I had a budget of $50 today, but I went under. $42.29 9 p.m. — Dull headache is back. I'm calling it a day and laying in bed until I pass out. Daily Total: $90.99",1,37
"7:15 a.m. — Snooooooze. It's Monday, and I am not excited. I make my daily cup of tea and two scrambled pesto eggs, and then sit in front of more episodes of before I shower and get ready for work. 9:18 a.m. — A new work day! Let's get this going! Positive affirmation and energy! I spend a couple of hours working on a project before going to a meeting. 11:45 a.m. — Today the cafeteria has taco meat and crunchy shells (boo, everyone knows soft tacos are the way to go). I just take taco meat, lettuce, and cheese, and call it a lunch before heading back to work. 3 p.m. — Taking a break and looking at flights to Portland. I'm going for the first time over my birthday weekend in June! My friend and I booked our Airbnb last week – a tiny home! How freaking cute is that? They have a hammock/net thing going on and I'm super excited to stay there. I decided that I'll commit to buying flights tomorrow, since tickets are supposedly cheaper on Tuesdays. 5 p.m. — Today dragged, and I am starving. I leave the office and eat my leftover ground turkey when I get home. Then I succumb to playing an never-ending game of fetch with my dog. 8:45 p.m. — I go to the gym for week two, day two of the running program. This run is rough – just one of those days where I'm out of energy. I beat my numbers from yesterday though! I planned to do legs today, but my hamstrings yell at me to refrain from more activity, so I just stretch and go home. 10 p.m. — Eat sliced mango, meal prep, shower, ~treat myself~ with a face mask, put my hair into braids so that it's wavy in the morning, and get in bed by 11. Daily Total: $0",2,37
"5:50 a.m. — Wake up way before my alarm and am so upset. I angrily try to catch one last hour of sleep. 7:15 a.m. — I'm definitely feeling grumpy, but I figure food will help. I have my daily tea and eggs, and then watch Netflix. My mornings are sacred, and I like to follow the same daily ritual to maintain a sort of organized zen. 9:10 a.m. — The weather outside is moody, and it's affecting me. I get to work and mindlessly check emails and search for flight deals to Portland. Tickets are a little bit cheaper today! I commit and book a roundtrip ticket. I immediately text my friend to let her know Portland is *happening for real*! $154 10 a.m. — I use my bad mood from this morning to fuel my productivity and finish up my project before sending it off for review. Let's hope for the best! 5:30 p.m. — I leave a little later today after finishing up an email, and then get a text from a friend asking if I want to see a preview of Heck, yes! 6 p.m. — We meet at the Whole Foods bar and get a cute little cheese and charcuterie board. I lo0o0oo0ve cheese and meats and bread, so this really hits the spot. Since my friend made me a wonderful dinner last week (creamy shrimp risotto, shout out to Bon Appétit ), I pick up the tab on this one. $14.07 8:30 p.m. — Wow! was a beautiful movie! I definitely teared up a bunch of times. We walk out in awe, feeling those warm, feel-good flutters. I thank her for inviting me to tag along and we part ways. 9 p.m. — My dog tackles me as soon as I get home! We play fetch for a bit. I was going to go to the gym, but decide against it, as I am pretty tired. I'm in bed by 10:30. Daily Total: $168.07",3,37
"6:50 a.m. — Wake up before my alarm again, to no surprise. I'm going through a breakup, so I've been having a hard time sleeping lately. I wake up this morning feeling really sad. (It's week two since the breakup, and I've been a mess. One second I'll be okay, and then suddenly I am okay.) I do my usual slow morning with my tea and eggs. I hug my dog for a while until he cries for me to get off of him. 9:10 a.m. — I get to my office's parking garage and receive a text from my ex. I have something of his that he needs back and he wants to know if he can get it today. Somehow, this small exchange leads to a 20-minute sob session in my car. I'm already dreading seeing him. 9:30 a.m. — I finally find enough strength to get out of the car and walk into the office. I'm feeling a whirlwind of emotions and still tearing up at my desk. To calm my mind, I start browsing online for poetry books. I recently discovered this writer on Twitter, R. H. Sin. I might order his new book on Amazon, but first – I dive into work. 1:30 p.m. — My ex meets me at my work parking lot. I am so anxious for this meeting, but he has a calming effect on me, so I guess it goes well. We catch up for a bit and share a long hug before he leaves. I wonder if this is the last time I'll ever see him. He broke it off, and I think it's for the best for both of us, but it still sucks. 4:15 p.m. — I'm pretty much over today emotionally, so I'm leaving work early to meet with a friend. I offered to drive to a new boba spot 15 minutes away, and we stay there chatting until they close at 10. I tell her what's been going on and tear up multiple times. She gives really good advice and affirmation about the whole situation, and I'm reminded that I have an amazing friend who looks out for me. I pay for our drinks because I think she got mine last time. $12.77 10:30 p.m. — The minute I step foot inside the house, I realize that I skipped dinner and am starving. Thankfully my parents left grilled chicken salad in the fridge, which I inhale. I'm in bed by 11:30 but don't really sleep until 1. There's a lot on my mind. Daily Total: $12.77",4,37
"7:30 a.m. — Awake again at 6:30, but not having it today, so I snooze for an hour. Kiss my dog good morning and make my usual eggs and cup of tea. I feel a little better today. 9:30 a.m. — Get to work a little later than usual, but I listen to a really good set of songs in the car on my way there and feel like today is going to be a good day. My friend is celebrating his birthday tonight and we're supposed to have dinner and head downtown after, so I'm excited to get my mind off of things and have fun. 5:45 p.m. — I finally get to leave work! I was pretty productive today, but at the end I had to sit through a loooong meeting from 3 to 5 p.m., which made me SO tired. It was in a stuffy boardroom with zero circulation and a seemingly endless conversation about table games. I  excused myself to take a small lap just to get my blood flowing. 6:10 p.m. — I've spent the past two and a half weeks trying to grow out my eyebrows, and I've finally had enough of looking at my bushy brows. Plus, I'm going out tonight and want to look cute, so I go to my friendly neighborhood threading lady to get my brows and upper lip done. I tip $2. $15 7:45 p.m. — I finish getting ready and leave for dinner. We're meeting at this vegan Chinese restaurant (which is a thing, and it's so good) called Veggie House in Chinatown. We all grub, and my friends are surprised at how good it is. We each pay for our share. $20 10 p.m. — Two of my friends and I carpool downtown and as soon as we walk out of the parking garage, random men on the street start bothering us. One even gives my friend a piece of paper that says, “Do you like me? Yes or No."" Why are guys so strange and weird? Anyway, experiencing this makes me think about how whenever I'd go downtown with my ex, he always protected me from this kind of thing. But I promise myself I won't get sad and cry tonight (!), so I try to push it away by drinking a Tequila Sunrise at the bar inside the Fremont Hotel while we wait for others to come. $8 11 p.m. — My friends love this small bar called Vanguard, so we head over and spend the rest of the night there. Usually this place has really good music to dance to, but for some reason the DJ tonight keeps playing the same songs over again (like ""Get Low"" by Lil Jon, THREE times). 12:45 a.m. — To my surprise, the birthday boy is very inebriated and decides he's gonna go home, so we all leave. One of the girls wants tacos, so we stop by Tacos El Gordo for late-night eats. I'm not really feeling tacos, so I try the campechana fries (mix of adobada and carne asada meat on top of fries, with guac, cheese, sour cream, and some other sauce they have) and I'm glad I ordered it. So good, but I can't have it again for a while! $7.57 2 a.m. — I make sure all my friends got home safely, then wash my face and quickly fall asleep. Daily Total: $50.57",5,37
"6:30 a.m. — It really is such a bummer for me when my eyes open in the morning before my alarm. I just want to stop being heartbroken so I can have better dreams and sleep. I snooze a little bit more before getting up and going about my morning routine. My body feels tired, which makes me want to skip a party tonight just to go to sleep earlier, but that's a decision I'll make later. 9:20 a.m. — I have a project due Monday, and I want to finish 95% of it today. I have only one 30-minute meeting before lunch, so I should be able to focus on my project all day. 1 p.m. — For a while I've been thinking of dyeing my hair grey/lavender (as an ombré or balayage), but I've been holding off because 1. it's expensive, 2. I work at a pretty traditional corporate office (ugh) and I'm pretty sure they have a policy against unnatural hair color, and 3. the necessary maintenance would suck. But since I'm going through a breakup, I'm thinking, ? I asked the analytics office admin if I would be breaking any HR rules, and she says to ask my VP if he's okay with it. 1:30 p.m. — I show my VP a picture of what I want my hair to look like. He is super laidback and says he has no problems with it. Yay! Operation Paint Me Lavender is a go! 5:30 p.m. — I get home and realize I forgot my laptop on my desk. Ugh. You know when you prepare yourself to do the thing you said you would do, but still end up forgetting to do it? Maybe I'll stop by this weekend to grab it. Highly unlikely, but I like thinking about it. I eat dinner with my parents. Dad got pizza! My kryptonite! My body is still tired, so I go upstairs to take a nap. 8 p.m. — My alarm goes off and I decide not to go to the party. I'm tired, and I feel like I need to take time for myself. I stalk my ex's Instagram and see that he deleted a lot of photos of us (though not everything). As much as I knew this was going to happen, I am still hurt. I'm not emotionally in a place to be around a bunch of people trying to have fun right now. 2 a.m. — After hours of overthinking, I let go of my thoughts and sleep. Daily Total: $0",6,37
"8 a.m. — Wow, I'm surprised I wake up at this time. I'm starving. I'm meeting with a friend for brunch in a couple of hours, so I just have my daily tea with fruit while watching Netflix. 11 a.m. — I pick up my friend and drive us across town to a new brunch spot called Neighbors Cafe. It is so cute and there are lots of plants. I order a lavender latte and shakshuka. We catch up on each other's lives for a while and I'm surprisingly calm when I explain the breakup. I'm progressing! Closer to acceptance! Maybe! $15.71 1:30 p.m. — My gas light goes on when I start my car, so I stop by the nearest gas station. $29.87 2 p.m. — My friend needs to return a romper and I want to window shop to gather ideas for Coachella outfits, so we spend a little bit of time at the mall. By a little bit, I mean 30 minutes, because we both hate shopping and we're lazy. 2:15 p.m. — I drop off my friend at her house. There are yellow flowers that look like spiky dahlias in her yard, and when I mention how pretty they are, she hops out of the car and snips off three stems to give to me! So sweet. I need to replace my dying (read: dead) white lilies, and these happy-colored flowers will help brighten up my room. 5:45 p.m. — I go to my sister's for dinner and then take her browned bananas with me to make banana bread tomorrow! 7:30 p.m. — I'm bored and I don't want to go home just yet (more like: I'm starting to feel sad again and can't be home alone), so I give shopping another try. I go to a different mall this time and walk out with chokers from H&M and a cute moto jacket from Old Navy, which is on sale. $31.38 9:30 p.m. — Still don't wanna go home, so I go over to my friend's apartment to hang out. We both love nature photography and traveling in general, so we decide to go to Bryce Canyon next weekend for new shots and to get away from the city for a bit. He has to be at a work meeting at an ungodly hour tomorrow morning, so I go home. 11:15 p.m. — In bed, I spend time reaffirming myself. The universe has been kind to me the past two weeks, and I'm humbled. I am grateful for all of my friends who have reached out and taken the time to hear me out (some over and over). Emotionally, times are tough, but I am tougher. This sucks now, but it won't be forever. It's for the better. Daily Total: $76.96",7,37
"5 a.m. — Ugh, Monday's are the worst. I do a 40-minute walk/run (emphasis on the walk) to wake up. I walk and feed the dog, and then get ready for work. I'm excited to try out new makeup I got this weekend – finding foundation that works with my fair skin and freckles has been near impossible until now. 7 a.m. — Arrive at work, eat cereal, and drink two cups of coffee. Peruse the internet while eating grapes and one more cup of coffee, and wait for our 10 a.m. weekly update meeting. 11 a.m. — Eat carrots, almonds, and leftover chicken breast from grilling this past weekend while reading Money Diaries. 12:45 p.m. — I eat a cookie in our break room and listen to a podcast. Then I finally fill out my social security name change form, even though I've been married for nearly a year (oops!). I pay for the online submittal process so I don't have to go in in person. $38 3:15 p.m. — Leave work, return a few dresses I bought online that don't fit, and stop at Trader Joe's for groceries we can't get at our regular grocery store: pre-made salads, hummus, and grilled chicken. I get home, enjoy a cuddle session with my dog, and take her to the small dog park near us to play with the other dogs. $49.12 6 p.m. — My husband comes home with groceries from the regular grocery store including cereal, yogurt, oranges, cucumbers, turkey burgers, deli meat, and bread ($80.53). I'm so excited we don't have visitors for the first time in three weeks (we recently moved here, and family and friends have been amazing and visiting a lot), so I spend the night doing BBG pilates, drinking tea, putting on a face mask, and catching up on TV shows. I'm in bed by 9 p.m. $80.53 Daily Total: $167.65",1,38
"6 a.m. — I forgot to set my 5 a.m. alarm, so no walk/run this morning. I wake up and feed the dog. Then I do minimal makeup (eyebrows, mascara, and bronzer) and head out. 7 a.m. — Arrive at work and eat cereal while drinking two cups of coffee. 9 a.m. — Received lab supplies that were the wrong size (my fault), and try to calm down while snacking on an orange and carrots. This careless mistake will seriously delay my timeline. 11:45 a.m. – Leave my meeting famished, and wolf down a handful of almonds, a Trader Joe's salad, and a cup of cucumbers. I'm a veggie fiend: My mom would always catch me trying to steal them from the grocery store as a toddler; weird, I know. 3:15 p.m. — Leave work and head to LensCrafters. My glasses broke a couple of weeks ago and I recently ordered the same ones and paid full price ($400) until I remembered that my company pays for vision insurance!  They reimburse me the part that my company covers: $167.50 – I'll take it! 4:30 p.m. — I cuddle with my dog, walk her, and watch TV to relax before doing pilates. After showering, I cook and eat two turkey burger patties and grapes. I peruse Amazon for things I want: an Instant Pot, teeth whitening strips, a curling wand, a Dead Sea mud mask, and nail polish. I put them in my cart but don't buy them. I like to spend time thinking about whether they're really worth it and come back to evaluate in a week. 8 p.m. – My husband comes home from basketball with friends and we chat for a while before he takes our dog out and I make us tea before bed. We're both introverted and really enjoying not having any guests for the first time in a really long time. Daily Total: $0",2,38
"5 a.m. — I do a 40-minute walk/run to wake up, walk and feed the dog, and get ready for work with my normal routine: quick body wash, wrinkle cream, eye cream, primer, foundation, concealer, blush, finishing powder, eyebrow darkener, and mascara. 7 a.m. — Arrive at work, eat cereal, and drink two cups of coffee. 10 a.m. — Snack on an orange and almonds while making calls to vendors and finishing slides. 11:30 a.m. — Lunch is catered today since we have CPR training all afternoon. (Ocean testing combined with electrical equipment makes this a must.) I leave to pick up a few Diet Cokes because I'm craving it and need to take my mind off my hunger before lunch is served. We finally eat at 12, and I wolf down a ginormous turkey avocado wrap and spend the rest of the meeting with a stomachache. $3.99 3 p.m. — CPR is over. I used to be a lifeguard and this was a very basic class I thought I would ace, but there was a ton I forgot or that has been updated since my lifeguard days. I feel old! Still, it was a good break and a fun group exercise. My office only has five people in it, so it's more of a family vibe. 4 p.m. — Get home and take the dog to the park. Her favorite puppy is there, so they play for over 30 minutes until she's pooped. I do the BBG Challenge workout – it's a brutal 30-minute leg workout and I'm spent. Afterwards, I watch TV, eat a Trader Joe's salad, and spend time with my husband discussing houses we're looking at this weekend in the hopes of buying soon. 8 p.m. — In bed with my tea, and my husband reminds me that I keep stealing his headphones since I can't find mine. I know the second I order another pair I'll find my old ones, but I've looked everywhere. I admit defeat and order the same pair, plus I throw in the Dead Sea mud mask ($15). $22.94 Daily Total: $26.93",3,38
"5 a.m. — I do a 40-minute walk/run, take care of the dog, and get ready for work. It's supposed to rain today, so I grab my rain jacket and find my headphones in the pocket as I'm heading to my car. Of course. 6:50 a.m. — Arrive at work, eat cereal, and drink coffee. I got paid today, so I Venmo my sister $200. My mom lives with my sister and her family in an in-law suite, and they've had some health and money problems recently, so I'm trying to help when I can while still trying to save for a house of my own. It's a difficult balance. $200 9:45 a.m. — My meeting gets pushed back from 10 a.m. to 10:30, and it usually runs over an hour, so I up my snack intake to an orange, cucumbers, and almonds to try and stave off the inevitable hanger. 12:30 p.m. — Meeting finally ends and I wolf down a Trader Joe's salad with turkey deli slices for extra protein. I finish some experiments and am out the door by 3:15 p.m. 3:30 p.m. — Get home, walk the dog, and contemplate whether to work out or take a nap. Sleep wins. 6 p.m. — Husband comes home and we make plans for a date night tomorrow at a comedy club next to our place. Tickets are $15 each, plus tax. I eat a salad and contemplate whether to drink wine or wait until the weekend. I'm proud I choose tea instead. $37.50 8 p.m. — Watch TV and relax before falling asleep. Daily Total: $237.50",4,38
"6 a.m. — It's Friday! I get to work, eat cereal, and drink coffee. Go to a couple meetings and do some work, but spend most of the morning planning what I'm going to cook for this weekend. Eat my last TJ's salad, carrots, and a handful of almonds. 1 p.m. — My boss wants me to use a certain chemical in the lab, but I don't want to because it's carcinogenic. My coworkers talk about it not being a big deal, but my brother died from colon cancer a couple years ago (not that they know). A rubber factory was dumping carcinogenic material into our backyard and my whole neighborhood has some form of cancer or another. This particular material is common and isn't carcinogenic once it's mixed and dry, but it puts a damper on my mood and I just try not to cry for the rest of the day. 3 p.m. — Out the door and heading home! I send my husband a list of groceries for me to cook this weekend — staying in is just what we need. He picks up sausage, ground turkey, pasta, crushed tomatoes, fresh basil, eggs, breadcrumbs, ground beef, refrigerated crescent rolls, and pickles. I talk to my sister on the phone about my bad day and she cheers me up. $75 6 p.m. — I make a cheeseburger crescent ring with homemade French fries and it's amazing — definitely going to make it again soon. We drink wine, catch up on , and head out to the comedy show. We have a couple drinks each at the show ($38) and a lot of laughs, and are in bed before midnight. $38 Daily Total: $113",5,38
"8:30 a.m. — I wake up a little hungover and see my husband is already up with the dog. I go for an hour-long walk on the treadmill and then we head out to meet our real estate agent at 10:45 a.m. 1 p.m. — Head back from all the house-hunting feeling exhausted. We found a house we really love but are weighing the pros and cons. It's beautiful, but expensive and not in the location we really want. San Diego is so expensive! 2 p.m. — I start cooking a tomato sauce in the slow cooker and throw in homemade turkey meatballs. Then, I organize my closet and watch TV while everything is cooking. We enjoy spaghetti with meatballs and another night in with wine and movies. Daily Total: $0",6,38
"10 a.m. —  I can't believe I slept in so much! I eat breakfast and do pilates while watching TV. 1 p.m. — My husband comes home from the gym and grocery store with groceries for the week: kombucha, cereal, turkey deli meat, turkey burgers, bread, carrots, grapes, yogurt, almond milk, apples, oranges, and cucumbers. We meet our friend and his dog and drive to the large dog park on Fiesta Island. We walk the entire perimeter while the dogs play on the beach for over three miles. $98.23 5 p.m. — After giving the dog and ourselves baths, we are all exhausted and content. We meal prep for the week ahead, look at a few houses online, and eat the rest of the spaghetti and meatballs from last night. 8 p.m. — We watch one more episode of on Netflix with tea and then pass out. It was a great weekend. It's nice to finally relax and feel rejuvenated. Daily Total: $98.23",7,38
"7:30 a.m. — My alarm goes off and I hit snooze twice. I'm feeling under the weather today and think I'm getting a bit of a head cold. I consider asking my supervisor if I can work from home, but suck it up and drag myself to shower and get dressed. My New Year's resolution for 2018 was to order lunch less often while at work, so I pack a quick lunch (Korean chicken and mixed veggies that I made earlier this week), plus a clementine and a banana to snack on, and head out the door. 9:10 a.m. — Hop onto the PATH train to make my way across the river into NYC. It's a pretty quick ride (just four stops for me), but I usually bring a book to read to keep myself occupied. I just finished ; I'm starting today. 9:30 a.m. — I make a quick stop at Duane Reade before heading into the office to pick up cold and cough medicine. My birthday is this weekend and I am determined to not be sick for all of my plans! $13.49 10:30 a.m. — There's a local volleyball league starting in Hoboken next month that I've convinced some of my friends to join with me. I offer to sign up and pay for everyone, then just have them Venmo me back. I'm always looking for fun ways to stay active, so I'm really excited for the league to begin, although I do wish it was outdoor instead of in a gym. Hello, skinned knees! $120 5:30 p.m. — I cough and sniffle my way through the day and ask my supervisor if I can head out of work a little early. I usually stay until around 6 or 6:30, but I'm feeling super groggy and not being productive at all. 7 p.m. — I don't have much of an appetite when I'm not feeling well, but I am craving pastina tonight. My grandma always used to make it for me when I was sick, and I'm feeling nostalgic for it. I make myself a heaping bowl and crawl into bed to continue binging before passing out around 10:30. Daily Total: $133.49",1,39
"9:30 a.m. — It's finally Friday! I wake up feeling much better than I did yesterday and take my time getting ready. It's an unspoken rule that everyone gets into the office late on Fridays, so I take full advantage of that every week. Once I get into the city, I stop and treat myself to a yummy breakfast sandwich on my way into the office. $4.53 1 p.m. — I'm feeling stir crazy in the office and go out for a walk with my coworker. I remember I need new fabric hangers, so we stop into Bed Bath & Beyond and I pick up a pack. I manage not to get swept up in the endless rows of kitchen gadgets like I normally do, and leave with just the hangers. $10.88 5 p.m. — My coworkers surprise me during our weekly staff meeting with two giant cookie cakes (yum!) for my birthday. I'm not a big sweets person, but they chose the best flavors: double chocolate chunk and snickerdoodle with Reese's Pieces. After the staff meeting ends, we hang in the conference room a bit longer chatting about the plan for tomorrow night. A handful of my co-workers are coming out to Hoboken tomorrow to celebrate my birthday, and I'm so excited for them to meet all of my friends from home! 6 p.m. — I stop in a few stores on 5th Avenue before hopping on the PATH to go home in search of a cute birthday outfit. NYC is definitely not my favorite place to shop — all the stores are always so crowded and they're much smaller than stores you'd find in a mall. I don't find anything I love, but that doesn't stop me from snagging a few sweaters that are on sale. I know it's almost spring, but it's still cold here, so I justify my purchase. $64.90 8 p.m. — I get home and throw in a couple of loads of laundry while making dinner – black bean burgers with a side of sautéed zucchini. My roommate and I get comfy on the couch and decide to rent . We munch on popcorn and catch up on our weeks during the movie, and I fall asleep around 11. Daily Total: $80.31",2,39
"9 a.m. — I wake up feeling super refreshed this morning, and make myself toast and peanut butter for breakfast. I give my apartment a good, deep clean in anticipation of my friends coming over before my birthday dinner tonight. 12 p.m. — I just joined a new gym near my apartment, and today I have a free personal training session. My trainer totally kicks my butt and I leave feeling strong and accomplished (and a little bit sore). I walk home making a mental note of all of the things I need to do today before my friends come over. 2 p.m. — My friend, E., surprises me and takes me out for a birthday manicure! We stop by a nail salon a few blocks from my apartment and she pays as part of my gift. After being pampered, we stop at the liquor store and I grab a few bottles of champagne ($12.81) for a pre-dinner toast when my friends come over later, and also snag two pairs of cute sunglasses at a small boutique we pass ($38.38). $51.19 7 p.m. — Guests start arriving! My friends and I drink champagne and catch up before heading out to our dinner reservation at The Ainsworth. My friends are sneaky and tell the waitress it's my birthday, so she brings out a massive bowl of ice cream and candles and everyone sings ""Happy Birthday"" after we finish eating. Then, we hop around to different bars for a while before ending with a quick stop for empanadas. My friends picked up my tab for dinner and drinks, so I pay for the late-night treats. A few friends come back to my apartment for a bit longer and I finally crawl into bed around 3:30 a.m. – exhausted but so happy with how the night turned out! $13.79 Daily Total: $64.98",3,39
"10 a.m. — It's officially my birthday! My mom is coming over early today, so I drag myself out of bed with just a slight hangover to go grocery shopping before she gets here. I stop at my local market to grab supplies for this week's lunches and dinners ($28.64) and then stop at the drug store on the way home to grab floss, soap, face wash, and cotton balls ($32.39). When I get home, I get my lunch started in my Crock Pot: shredded salsa verde chicken with black beans to throw over salad for the week. I set it for four hours and hop in the shower. $61.03 1 p.m. — I'm so excited my mom is finally here! She hasn't been to my new apartment since I moved in, so I give her the tour and then open the birthday gifts that she brought me. She got me a cute little grocery cart (my shoulders are saved!) and gift cards to some of my favorite stores. She helps me hang pictures in my room that I've been procrastinating putting up, and we hang out and catch up before going to my favorite Cuban restaurant, La Isla, for dinner. 7:30 p.m. — The birthday surprises continue! My mom texted a bunch of my friends (without me knowing) to come over after we got back from dinner for cake and cupcakes. Everyone leaves around 8:30, and I get into bed and watch Netflix until I fall asleep at 10:30. I'm taking a break from to watch the newest season of . Daily Total: $61.03",4,39
"7:30 a.m. — It's a struggle getting out of bed today after such a long, fun weekend. I shower and pack up my lunch as well as some of the leftover cupcakes to bring in for my coworkers. I check my email as I'm heading out the door and see my VP emailed me about attending a client event with him after work today. UGH, it's going to be a late night. 12:30 p.m. — Today has been non-stop meetings and phone calls and I need a brain break! I heat up my lunch and check up on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram to see what I've missed today. I also remember that I need to buy something cheap and easy to cover up the holes in my bedroom wall (from past tenants hanging pictures), so I order a small tube of Patch Plus Primer on Amazon. My free Amazon Prime one-month trial isn't over yet, so shipping is free! $7.43 5 p.m. — I take an Uber uptown to the event. It's not exactly the most exciting stuff, so I'm thrilled when my VP suggests we wrap up a little bit early. ($15.57 expensed) 8 p.m. — I know I'm not going to want to cook when I get home after such a long day, so I order a penne vodka pizza (my favorite) from this amazing pizzeria called Napoli's and then order an Uber home. I expense the Uber ($40.19) on my corporate card, since this was a client event, and enter a two-stop ride so I can scoop up the pizza on my way. Thankfully, I timed things perfectly and my pizza is ready as soon as we arrive. $22.42 8:40 p.m. — When I get to my apartment, I find a big bouquet of roses waiting for me from my roommates as a post-birthday gift, since they were both away this past weekend. So sweet! The three of us catch up in the living room and make dinner plans for tomorrow night. There's a new hibachi restaurant in town that we've all been dying to try. I scarf down my pizza and call my friend to chat before watching a few episodes of and falling asleep around 11:30. Daily Total: $29.85",5,39
"8 a.m. — I get a text alert that the PATH is experiencing major delays today. Ugh, this feels like  a weekly occurrence. As I grab my lunch and start to head out the door, my roommate asks me to check if she left her straightener on in her room. Luckily she didn't – crisis avoided. 1 p.m. — It's not unbearably cold out today, so I go for a walk to stretch my legs. I stop into Bath & Body Works because I'm in the market for new candles, because the dozen I already have in my room isn't enough. I settle on a mint eucalyptus candle and head back to the office for another afternoon full of meetings and phone calls. $26.67 3 p.m. — I have a client based in Tel Aviv who's in New York right now for a product photoshoot, so we decide to meet up for tea. She orders an earl grey tea and I get myself a green tea. I pick up the tab on my corporate card. I have to head back to the office for a call at 4, so both head out. ($12.35 expensed) 5:30 p.m. — There's a major snowstorm heading our way and our work policy is that if NYC public schools close, our office closes. Mayor de Blasio announces in a press conference this afternoon that he's closing schools, so looks like we're getting a snow day! The snow is supposed to start tonight, so we all head out a bit early to prepare. 6:15 p.m. — A clothing subscription box I ordered arrives today, so I get charged for it. It's great because I don't even have to leave the house to shop, and the pieces that I receive are usually things I wouldn't pick out for myself but still end up loving. In today's box, I got seven items of clothing. I decide to keep five: a bomber jacket, two sleeveless shirts, and two cute short-sleeved shirts. I'm going to send back a cocktail dress, since I don't have an immediate need for it, and a pair of jeans that don't fit very well. $255.20 7:30 p.m. — My roommates and I have been trying to nail down a night for all of us to go out to dinner, and we're finally all free tonight. We head over to the hibachi restaurant with a couple of bottles of wine since the place is BYOB. I always get unreasonably stressed when the cook tosses food in everyone's mouths, because I never catch it, but on the third try, I catch the piece of zucchini that he tosses my way! I'd consider this a successful trip. $36.65 10:30 p.m. — We're all a little bit buzzed getting back to the apartment and each have another glass of wine in the kitchen before heading to bed. Daily Total: $318.52",6,39
"8:30 a.m. — Since its a snow day, I sleep a little bit later than usual and quickly eat a yogurt before my 9 a.m. check-in call with my supervisor. We chat through the day's priorities and plan to reconnect again at the end of the day. We're super busy today, which stresses me out. It's much harder to work quickly on my small laptop as opposed to the giant desktop I have in the office, but I throw on my headphones and start jamming on a few projects. 12:30 p.m. — One of my roommates is working from home as well today, and since I've had a really productive morning, I step away from my computer for a bit and we chat and have lunch together. We talk about watching a movie later, but she and her boyfriend get into an argument, so she has to deal with that for a while. Yikes. 5 p.m. — My friends who live a few floors down text me to say that they're ordering food and wine. I really shouldn't order food since I have plenty of groceries to make dinner, but it's a snow day, so I cave and go downstairs. I bring my laptop to their apartment to work a bit longer and then log off when the food gets delivered. I pay for my share. $11 7 p.m. — After we're all a couple of glasses of wine deep, we decide to play Heads Up. We're all pretty buzzed at this point, so the game is even more hilarious than usual, and we end up having so much fun that we don't realize we've been playing for hours! The night is winding down and so is the snow, so there's definitely no chance of a snow day tomorrow. I head back up to my apartment around 11:30, throw on sweatpants, and hop into bed.

"5:30 a.m. — Ugh. The alarm is especially rough this morning. It's the first day back to school after two weeks of glorious spring vacation. I spent 10 days traveling, and returning to reality is not welcome. I flew in early Friday morning, and then spent all day yesterday sleeping and feeling incredibly jet-lagged, so my sleep schedule is very off this morning. In the UAE, we work Sundays through Thursdays, so I don't have another day to catch up before going back to work. 6:40 a.m. — After showering and getting ready for the day, I leave for work. Usually I pack my breakfast and lunch, but I didn't have time to go grocery shopping and re-stock my fridge yesterday, so I don't follow my routine this morning. I stop at Costa on my way to work and get a large coffee with soy milk and an almond milk oatmeal parfait. $9.50 7 a.m. — I arrive at work and rush to prepare myself for the day. After two weeks off, getting back into teaching mode is hard, and I need to review my lessons for today. Luckily, I have the first block off and have time to orient myself. 7:40 a.m. — Well...so much for free time this morning. Another social studies teacher (and one of my closest friends) is still in the Seychelles, and the school forgot to schedule a sub for her. I volunteer to cover for her and take her class, since I know what they're learning. 12:05 p.m. — After teaching all morning, lunch is a welcome break. However, since I don't have my usual packed lunch, I have to run down to the café and grab a smoothie and energy bar. I hate buying food here, but I'm desperate. $6 2:45 p.m. — The day is over — thank goodness! Today was a busy day, since I taught another two classes in the afternoon. Compared to teaching in the U.S., my teaching load is pretty light, so I can't complain too much. 3:30 p.m. — After spending a few minutes grading and catching up on emails after school, I head to the gym. In order to save money, I use the gym at my school. They have the basic equipment that I need, and I like being able to get my workouts in before I go home and lose motivation. I used to be self-conscious about being in workout gear with my kids around, but I've started to get used to it. Today is cardio and leg day, and I get a great workout in after taking the past two weeks off. 6 p.m. — After I finish my workout, I head directly to the grocery store. This store is a little out of my way, but they have the best prices and selection of items. I'm vegan, and most of the products I buy are a bit more expensive than if I ate a normal diet, but it's worth it for me. I have to stock up after being gone on vacation, so it's a big trip. I buy tofu, spinach, broccoli, bananas, carrots, soy milk, dairy-free yogurt, protein crackers, corn starch, rice cakes, peanut butter, soy sauce, peanut sauce, chili sauce, and mustard. $77.05 7:30 p.m. — On my drive home I call my mom and chat for a bit. (I pay extra to have international calling on my cell plan.) Get home, put away my groceries, snack on carrots and yogurt, and start to prep dinner. During the week I generally eat the same thing for dinner: tofu coated in cornstarch, lightly sautéed, and seasoned with a mixture of sauces (tonight it's soy, peanut, and garlic), plus steamed broccoli. 8:30 p.m. — Finish dinner, do the dishes, and make my lunch for tomorrow: a smoothie made of one banana, protein powder, powdered peanut butter, and ice cubes, plus rice cakes. 9 p.m. — Spend a few minutes putting a load in the washing machine and changing my sheets. I wait around for the cycle to finish so I can hang my clothes before showering and heading to bed. It takes me awhile to fall asleep because my sleep schedule is still off, but I'm out by 11.

"5:30 a.m. — I was going to try and get up early this morning to get cardio in before school. Unfortunately though, I woke up at 3 a.m. to a ""we need to talk about some stuff"" text from my long distance BF. We both have a lot of trust issues, and my anxiety kicks in hard after this message. I wasn't able to fully fall back asleep until 5 a.m. 6:45 a.m. — Shower, get dressed, grab my lunch, and head to work. I only live about about a 10-minute drive to school, and try to get in by 7 a.m. at the latest every day. In any other city, I'd walk to work if it were this close to where I live, but there are no sidewalks on the route and the area of Dubai I live in isn't very walking-friendly. 7 a.m. — I get to school and spend a few minutes answering emails before the kids come in at 7:30. I make a cup of coffee in the break room (instant coffee is free...not the best tasting, but free!), and add the soy milk that I bring in from home every week. I snack on rice cakes too. 8 a.m. — I have first block free again this morning, but have a few meetings. 12:05 p.m. — Lunchtime. I have my smoothie and rice cakes while leading a student council meeting in my room. I'm the faculty adviser for a student club at school. It's a bit more work, but I get an extra $1,000 stipend per year, which is nice. 2:45 p.m. — After lunch, I teach another class and then have a department meeting to finish off the day. Overall, it's a pretty easy afternoon. 3:30 p.m. — Finish up the day by planning a lesson for next week, and then head over to the gym. Do running intervals, followed by my least favorite workout of the week: shoulders. 6 p.m. — Finish working out and head for home. I call my parents on the way home and talk to them about summer plans and some decisions I have to make for my housing next year. 6:30 p.m. — I snack on carrots, crackers, and yogurt while making tofu with broccoli for dinner again. I watch (a secret obsession of mine) on YouTube while eating dinner and cleaning up. I make my lunch for the next day as well. 8:30 p.m. — I'm running low on protein powder, so I order some from the UAE's version of Amazon. After showering, I head to bed, but my BF and I have set up a Skype call for later tonight, so I set my alarm for 2 a.m. $30 Daily Total: $30",2,40
"6 a.m. — I was up from 2 a.m. to 4 this morning Skyping with my BF (9-hour time differences suck), so I give myself a few extra minutes of sleep. Losing a few hours of sleep wasn't fun, but we needed to talk and it was worth me being a bit sleepy this morning. Luckily we talked things out and I feel a lot less anxious now. I quickly shower, get ready for work, and still leave for school on time. 7 a.m. — Get to work and make my coffee. 12:05 p.m. — I use my lunch hour to run to the bank and withdraw cash. My good friend from work is getting married in France this summer in a chateau. They invited some of their closest friends to stay in the chateau for the the week, and I need to pay her in advance. It's pricey, but all meals are included, and it'll be an awesome week. Worth the cost! $200 1:45 p.m. — After lunch, I only have one more block to teach. And then after school we have our weekly all school meeting. 4 p.m. — I head to the gym for my workout. I run for awhile and then have a chest- and glutes-focused lift. 6 p.m. — I finish at the gym and head home to shower and change. I'm meeting friends for drinks later, but before I leave the house, I cook dinner: my usual meal of tofu and broccoli. I don't have time to eat before having to leave, but I also don't want to spend the money on dinner while we're out, so I'll wait until I'm home later to have a full meal. 8 p.m. — I walk to meet a few friends at a bar. Tonight is Ladies' Night, so we can have unlimited drinks for free. (A lot bars and restaurants in Dubai offer Ladies' Nights on different weeknights where they have free drinks, and sometimes meals, for women.) I meet my friends and we spend a few hours drinking and catching up. This bar has an amazing drink called a Pinky Swear, and while I don't drink enough to really get buzzed, I am definitely happier by the time we leave. 10 p.m. — I head home pretty early and re-heat my dinner. After eating and cleaning up I make my lunch for the next day, text with my BF for awhile, and head to bed. I'm asleep by 11:30. Daily Total: $200",3,40
"5:30 a.m. — Up at the usual time. Same routine of showering, getting dressed, and heading off to work. 7 a.m. — Coffee is definitely needed this morning. Getting back in the school routine is exhausting and I'm dragging. 10 a.m. — I teach one class this morning, then have a department meeting for the second block. 12:05 p.m. — Lunchtime. Usual smoothie and rice cakes that I brought from home. 2:45 p.m. — School's out. I had my favorite class (I know we aren't supposed to play favorites, but we totally do) for my last block. We spend a large part of the class talking about current events, specifically gun laws in the U.S. Part of me worries about losing instruction time, but I also hate to stop the students when they are so invested and interested in the world around them. 3 p.m. — My friend and I head down to the conference room for a surprise baby shower for one of our colleagues. I bid her my congratulations and head back to my classroom to work for a few minutes. 4 p.m. — Gym time. I'm incredibly sore and don't get my full cardio in, but still manage to do a mini stair workout and lift. 6 p.m. — I call my dad on my drive home, and then make my usual tofu for dinner, this time with spinach. I was supposed to go out to dinner with other friends tonight, but I'm too tired and decide to cancel. 8 p.m. — After cleaning up, I make my lunch and put away my clean clothes. I shower and read for a few minutes while waiting for my BF to wake up. We text for a few minutes, but he has an exam this morning and I'm exhausted. I fall asleep reading by 10:30 p.m. Daily Total: $0",4,40
"5:30 a.m. — Woohoo, it's Thursday! Last day of the week. Shower, get dressed, and off to work. 9:15 a.m. — Second period is my only off time today, so I take advantage and hole myself away in my classroom to get work done. I'm applying for some additional positions within the school next year, and need to finish my applications. 12:05 p.m. — I have my usual smoothie and rice cakes. A couple of my students wander in while I'm eating and want to chat. Sometimes I need my own space and kick them out, but today I'm okay with the visit. They start pulling up YouTube videos on my SMART Board and show me what a ""Walmart Yodeler"" is. I enjoy the little silly break with them. 2:45 p.m. — Made it to the weekend! Had another great class this afternoon to end the week on a high note. In addition to my kids getting the work done that I had planned, we also had some great conversation today. 4 p.m. — Last workout of the week. I don't have a ton of motivation this afternoon but manage to get it done. I save the easiest day of my workout cycle for Thursday – cardio followed by biceps and triceps! 6 p.m. — I head home, shower, change quickly, and then drive over to my friend's apartment for dinner. Despite seeing each other in school every day, we haven't hung out in awhile. Her fiancé is on a business trip and we often have dinner together when he's away. We were going to cook, but instead decide to order Lebanese: hummus, baba ganoush, falafel, fattoush, and bread. We split the cost. After a few hours of eating, watching reality TV, and gossiping, I head home. $15 11 p.m. — I promised another friend that I'd go out with him tonight. He's a promoter and every weekend has tables at different clubs that he needs to fill. I used to go out with him nearly every weekend, but got sick of the club lifestyle quickly. But I do enjoy going out with him occasionally, and it's good to catch up. I change clothes and he picks me up and drives us downtown. The drinks at the club are free since we're at a table, so the night doesn't cost me anything. 3 a.m. — We stay until the club closes and then my friend drives me home. Since I'm already up late, I talk to my BF for a few minutes before heading to bed. It's nearly 4 a.m. by the time I fall asleep, but oh well. Daily Total: $15",5,40
"11 a.m. — Despite it being the weekend, I still have an alarm set to make sure I don't oversleep TOO much. I wake up, make a cup of coffee, and sit on the balcony for a few minutes before starting to get ready for the day. 12:15 p.m. — I'm going to brunch with the same friend I was out with last night and some of his friends. Brunching is a big thing in Dubai, and today we're going to one of my favorite spots. It's at a beach club, and along with the unlimited food and drink, you also get pool access and can spend the day in the sun. I try to keep my brunches limited to once or twice a month because of how expensive they are. My friend decides to drive again today, so no Uber cost for the morning. $80 5 p.m. — We spend the afternoon drinking, eating, and tanning. I've never met any of the people we're out with, but I get along well with some of the girls. Brunch ends at 5 p.m., and tonight is a dry night in Dubai. Today is Al-Israa' and Al-Miraj, an Islamic holiday, and on certain holidays the government mandates that there can be no alcohol sold in order to respect the Muslim laws. Normally we'd hang around the club after brunch ends, but they stop serving alcohol almost immediately. 5:30 p.m. — My friend has another friend who's taking his yacht out for the evening, and he invites me to join. He pays for our Uber to the marina to meet them. 10 p.m. — We spend a few hours cruising around. Yacht parties are one of my favorite things to do here; I love seeing the city from a different angle and being out on the water. Usually everyone chips in to rent the boat and buys food and drinks to bring, but the host has covered the cost of everything tonight. We dock out by the deserted World Islands (a Dubai tourist attraction that they gave up on building) and swim for awhile. After brunch and an evening out, everyone's pretty drunk by the time we dock again. 11 p.m. — I grab a cab with my friend and we head home. We live near each other, so it's easy to split. I pay for this one since he got the last. I get home around 11:30 and, after drunk texting the BF, immediately pass out. $10 Daily Total: $90",6,40
"8 a.m. — I wake up early and can't fall back asleep. I'm surprisingly not that hungover, but I text my friend and it sounds like he's in worse shape than I am. I make a cup of coffee and sit on the balcony and read before going back inside to do laundry and clean up a bit. I haven't properly cleaned my place since getting back from break, so my apartment is a bit of a wreck. 11 a.m. — I'm hungry and too lazy to cook, so I order a salad and hummus toast from one of my favorite cafés around. While I'm waiting for my food to arrive, I start an episode of . My BF recommended it, and I'm obsessed. $20 1 p.m. — After I eat, I pop down to the pharmacy that's below my building. Apparently last night I cut my legs on barnacles while swimming, and I need bacterial cream. The pharmacist ended up having some small sample packs and gave me some for free. I can go down and get more from the school nurse if I need it tomorrow, so I don't even have to spend any money! Win. I spend the afternoon pretending to get work done and grade papers. In reality, I just watch more and hang out. 5 p.m. — I throw tofu, spinach, and rice on the stove for dinner. I realize that I'm out of water, so I call down to the Blue Mart across the street and they bring up my order. (We don't drink the tap water here, so I have a large water dispenser that I buy four-gallon jugs for that last me a few weeks each.) $14 7 p.m. — I clean up dinner and make my smoothie for tomorrow. Once it hits morning in the U.S, I spend awhile chatting with my mom, my best friend, and BF. I plan to be asleep by 10 or 11, but don't end up falling asleep until almost midnight. Daily Total: $34",7,40
"5:30 a.m. — I'm up early today, because we have an event at work that I need to set up for. I pour myself coffee while our dog and two cats pace and beg for breakfast, so I feed them and then start getting ready for work. I wake up my husband, M., and our 9-year-old son, J., and get J.'s breakfast started before I leave. Since it's early and I have a long day ahead of me, I swing by Starbucks to grab more coffee. I text a coworker who is meeting me at the office to see if she wants anything. I get a blonde roast with cream for myself, and skinny vanilla latte for her. I use my app to pay. $7.29 11 a.m. — We have a lunch event today at work. Yay, free lunch! I have chicken, roasted veggies, a big salad, and a couple mini meatballs. The event is well-attended and since I came in early to set up, a few coworkers step up to break things down and clean up. 3:30 p.m. — I leave work a little early so I can stop at the grocery store before picking my son up from his after computer class at school. I go to Wegmans and get stuff for dinner and few things we're out of. Rotisserie chicken, lettuce, crumbled blue cheese, and avocado for Cobb salads tonight, plus yogurt, strawberries, turkey, provolone cheese from the deli, sparkling water, and milk. $44.52 4:30 p.m. — I have a little time before picking up my son, so I stop at Marshalls to browse. I find a pair of workout leggings that are on clearance and also get a tank. (I need a whole outfit, right?!) I pick up my son and when we get home, he does his homework while I prep dinner. I make homemade salad dressing, boil eggs, and cook bacon in the air fryer (best kitchen gadget, ever). M. gets home from work and takes the dog for a quick walk around the block. (Our pup is getting old and can only handle being out in the cold for a short time before his hips start really bothering him.) When he gets home, he helps me put the salads together and J. sets the table. We eat and clean up, and then M. helps J. with the rest of his homework while I take a hot bath. $28.25 9 p.m. — My son goes to bed and M. and I cozy up on the couch to watch Netflix. We want to start a new series but can't agree on one, so we end up watching on TV. While half paying attention, I look at my email and see our credit card statement has posted, which means we should now have enough points to pay for a good portion of our plane tickets for our trip to the Bahamas later this year. (We've already booked the resort for four nights.) I hop online and get three roundtrip tickets, and it only costs $203 after points. After the movie is over, I head to bed while M. stays up to watch the end of a hockey game. $203 Daily Total: $283.06",1,41
"6 a.m. — My alarm goes off and I'm actually feeling well-rested. I make coffee, feed the animals, and get ready for work. M. gets up and makes J.'s lunch; he asks me if I want anything, but I have lunch plans with a friend today. I wake up J. and help him with his breakfast. We try to teach him independence, because when you have an only child it's easy to just do everything for them, but sometimes it's just faster to help! He wants a smoothie, so we make one with frozen banana, fresh blueberries, strawberries, oats, spinach, plain Greek yogurt, a dash of cinnamon, and drizzle of honey. He loves it and I feel good sending him to school with that in his belly, instead of the Lucky Charms he was begging for! 8:30 a.m. — In the office I play a bit of catch up, since I was busy all week planning for the event yesterday. The morning goes by quick and I've cleaned out most of my inbox. I head down to the cafeteria to grab coffee. There's free coffee in our building, which isn't great ... but it's free. 12:30 p.m. — I meet my friend for a belated birthday lunch (mine was over a month ago, but we've been busy!). We go to a new poke bowl place and I order a bowl with cauliflower rice, ahi tuna, cucumber, bean sprouts, avocado, and this delicious spicy ginger soy sauce. My friend pays as a birthday treat! I take a longer-than-usual lunch break, since we're busy catching up. Thankfully, my office is really chill, and as long as I get my work done, my boss doesn't care if I'm not there from exactly 8 to 5 everyday. 2 p.m. — Back at the office, I get an email from Ulta about a gift with purchase deal. I order moisturizer, add mascara, lipstick, and two bubble baths (buy-one-get-one 50% off) to qualify for free shipping. $58.15 5 p.m. — Leave the office to head to a barre class. I like to go four times a week, but I've been busy and it's only my first class this week! I get a good workout in (abs were killer today!) and head home for a quick shower before dinner. My husband works from home on Thursdays, so he's in charge of dinner tonight. He makes tacos and they are just what I need. 8 p.m. — M. is getting ready to go out and meet friends to watch college basketball. His alma mater is in the tournament, so he's pretty pumped. The game is on late, but he's off tomorrow, so he decides to go out. He stops at the ATM to take out $40 for drinks. I put our son to bed early, take a bath (this is my stress reliever almost nightly in the cold months!), and watch I'm not super into it, so I mostly text with my friend who is getting married this summer. I'm sending her bridesmaid dress ideas, because she isn't sure what she wants us to wear. $40 11:45 p.m. — M. texts me to say the game is over, and he Ubers home ($8.50). I'm in bed already sleeping, but I wake up when he gets home, and he's really excited about the outcome of the game. I really just want to sleep, because I signed up for a 6 a.m. barre class tomorrow and the alarm will be going off in less than six hours. He gets the hint and lets me go back to sleep. $8.50 Daily Total: $106.65",2,41
"5:15 a.m. — My alarm goes off and and I consider shutting it off and canceling my barre class...but I know I'll regret it. I get up, splash cool water on my face, and get my workout clothes on. I pour a coffee to drink on the way to the studio, but it's way too hot and I only have a sip before class starts. 6:45 a.m. — I make it through my workout and I'm happy that I didn't bail. But I need caffeine, so I stop at a local coffee shop. I order a bulletproof coffee (with grass-fed butter and coconut oil), a muffin for J., and a caramel latte for M. J. is off from school today, so M. is taking the day off to stay home with him. J. is wide awake and playing video games already when I get home, and M. is still in bed (and probably hungover!). I give J. his muffin and tell him to cool it on the games, since it's barely 7 a.m. Take a quick shower, dry shampoo the heck out of my hair, and head to work. $12.30 11:30 a.m. — I've been busy all morning and have to work on a project with a coworker. She stops by my office to discuss what we're going to order to eat (ya know, the important things), and we decide on salads from a build-your-own deli bar. We call to place the order, and I get a salad with a spicy buffalo chicken, blue cheese, celery, banana peppers, and balsamic dressing. She orders a salad with salmon, sprouts, cucumber, and feta. I head out to pick them up. I pay, but will expense it, since it's a working lunch. ($32.12 expensed) 3 p.m. — My husband calls me to see if we want to have another couple over for dinner tonight. He offers to shop and cook, and he's already cleaned the house, so I'm all for it! He runs to the store to get stuff for homemade pizzas – his specialty! I make the dough and he tops the pizzas. I know there are two dough balls in the freezer, so it will be easy. We have a bunch of stuff on hand, so we only need (more) cheese, red onion, mushrooms, and steak, plus stuff for a antipasto tossed salad (romaine, olives, ham, salami, pepperoncini, and canned artichoke hearts). He also grabs a 12-pack of beer ($55.20). I stop and grab two bottles of wine on my way home ($23.14). $78.34 7 p.m. — Our friends come over and we have drinks and catch up, and the guys watch basketball. My friend and I put together the salad and keep my son entertained. (They don't have kids yet...so J. has to hang with the adults tonight.) M. cooks the pizzas and everything is really good. I have too much wine before dinner, so I switch to sparkling water while everyone else enjoys a post-dinner cocktail. Our friends brought over cookies from a local bakery, so we each have a few for dessert. I put J. to bed and join the adults for more basketball-watching, though I don't really pay attention. They leave pretty late and I'm exhausted, since I was up so early today! Daily Total: $90.64",3,41
"9:30 a.m. — I wake up, look at the clock, and am SHOCKED that I slept so late. I'm always up by 7 or 7:30, even on weekends. God bless my son, who woke up and fed the animals, which allowed me to sleep. (The kitten usually pounces on my bed in the morning when he wants to eat.) I don't even care that J.'s likely been up for hours playing video games. I planned to go to a 10 a.m. barre cardio class, but I don't want to rush around, so I cancel and schedule a class for tomorrow at 11. M. wakes up shortly after me (the man would sleep all morning if I let him!) and we talk about our plans for the day. He's going to the gym, doing a few projects around the house, and wants to get his haircut. I tell him he should take J., too. I'm just going to run errands today and then take J. over to my parents' house later for a sleepover. Looking forward to date night! 11 a.m. — I head out to make a few returns at Kohl's. I have a gift card from a Christmas return, and also a 30% off coupon. I buy sneakers for J. and a long cardigan and bra for myself. After the discount, return credit, and gift card, my total is only $7.18! $7.18 12:30 p.m. — Swing into Target for my biweekly trip. I get laundry detergent, Method spray cleaner, paper towels, tissues, Dove soap, cotton balls, Essie nail polish, a deep conditioning hair treatment mask, eye makeup remover, Advil, a couple clearance throw pillows for the living room, and a set of cloth napkins. I'm always happy when I make it out of Target without spending over $100! $98.45 3 p.m. — I get home and realize I haven't eaten. We have late dinner plans tonight with friends, and I know drinks will be involved beforehand. I make myself a late lunch so I'm not drinking on an empty stomach. Taco salad with leftovers from dinner the other night. M. calls to say the barber's credit card machine isn't working, so he asks me to Venmo his barber the money (he's a friend of M.'s). I send the $26 to cover the haircuts, and M. has enough cash to tip. $26 5 p.m. — My mom ends up coming to pick up J. for his sleepover, since she's in the neighborhood. M. and I finish getting ready and walk to a local bar to meet our friends for drinks before dinner. It's St. Patrick's Day AND the local college made it to round two of March Madness, so the first bar we go to is packed and full of drunk college kids. We get one drink each and decide we need to find someplace else to hang. M. picks up the round for the four of us. $33 6:30 p.m. — We find a quieter bar/restaurant across the street where we have a couple more drinks and watch the basketball game. The drinks are delicious (and not served out of plastic cups, like at the first bar!). I get a gin, elder flower liqueur, and grapefruit drink to start and then a champagne cocktail next. My girlfriend gets a couple mojitos, and the guys drink beer. Our friend buys the next couple rounds of drinks, and we cover the Uber to the restaurant. $18.55 8 p.m. — We arrive for dinner and our table isn't quite ready, so yet another round of drinks! The restaurant is really cool. The entire kitchen is open and viewable from the bar, so it's fun to hang and watch the action. Once we sit, we decide to share pickled shrimp as an appetizer. For my entrée, I order the truffle mac and cheese and a Caesar salad, which is enough to feed a family, so I share it with the rest of the table. My husband gets the burger and gives me half in exchange for some of my pasta. Everything is delicious. The desserts sound amazing, but we're all so full (of both food and alcohol!), so we get the check and call it a night. We split everything down the middle, since we all had similar items and drinks. Our half is $125, including about a 20% tip. Our friend gets the Uber and we head home for the evening. $125 Daily Total: $308.18",4,41
"8 a.m. — I wake up feeling pretty decent considering the amount of alcohol I had last night. I drink a big glass of water and take a couple Advil and a vitamin while I brew coffee. Even though I feel pretty good, I'm not feeling barre, but I don't want to cancel again. I see there are spots open for the 9:30 class and decide to switch to that one and just get it over with. If I wait until the 11 o'clock class, I'll likely to park it on the couch and not move all afternoon! 10:30 a.m. — Sweating out the alcohol was a good choice, and I feel even better now. When I get home, M. is just getting out of the shower and asks if I want to go to brunch. I'm always up for brunch, but we spent a lot of money last night, so I offer to cook at home instead. We agree that's probably a better idea. I take a quick shower while M. makes us Bloody Marys. I make a sweet potato and brussels sprout hash with bacon, onion, and a couple poached eggs on top. It's really good and cures the rest of my hangover. 1 p.m. — We head over to my parents to pick up J. from his sleepover. I stop into Whole Foods on the way because I need to get more of my probiotic. We also get a multivitamin for J. and a few bath bombs. $45.50 3 p.m. — After visiting with my parents for a bit we stop at Wegmans to stock up for the week. I decide to make shepherd's pie for dinner. We get ground lamb, boneless chicken thighs, bacon, eggs, milk, half and half, butter, sour cream, orange juice, a brick of cheddar cheese, cauliflower, potatoes, onion, carrots, a cucumber, cherry tomatoes, spinach, apples, bananas, blueberries, ham, Swiss cheese from the deli, ranch dressing, mayo, apple juice boxes, tomato paste, Goldfish, oatmeal, bread, creamy peanut butter, canned tuna, Halo Top ice cream, a bag of frozen peas, and a few cans of cat food. $117.63 4:30 p.m. — Settle in at home and put away the groceries with J. (This is one of J.'s chores, and he's naturally complaining.) M. starts laundry while I prep dinner and boil eggs for the week. (We all love hard boiled eggs!) Once dinner is in the oven, I sit down to read a little bit, but can't get into the book I started so I end up playing Mario Kart with J. and M. I lose, badly...like always! 6:30 p.m. — We eat dinner and clean up. I made two big pans of shepherd's pie, so we'll have lots of leftovers for lunch this week. I package up a couple single serving containers for both myself and M. J. gets in the shower and M. makes tuna salad for J. to bring for lunch tomorrow. (He's on a big tuna sandwich kick, and they're a pain to make in the morning while we're all rushing around, so we like to prep the night before.) 8 p.m. — J. goes to bed early. (He's always exhausted after sleeping over at grandma and grandpa's.) M. and I decide to start watching on Amazon, and it's pretty good. We watch two episodes before heading to bed. I play around on my phone before I fall asleep and see that I got 40% coupon from Gap in my email. J. needs new school uniform pants because all of his are getting short, so I order him two pairs along with a spring jacket (if spring weather ever comes to Buffalo!). I earn $20 in Gap Cash. $52.69 Daily Total: $215.82",5,41
"5:45 a.m. — Monday is the one day I can't be late, as we have our weekly sales meeting. Typical routine of coffee, dealing with the animals, and taking a quick shower. I wake J. up and he pours himself a bowl of cereal. M. gets up and I kiss him goodbye as he jumps in the shower. I actually make it out of the house early today, so I decide to treat myself to Starbucks. I order an herbal tea and pay with my app. $2.66 8 a.m. — I try not to fall asleep during the meeting. These things usually last about 45 minutes, or an hour max, but everyone is chatty today and we're in the conference room until almost 10 a.m. I have a call I need to be on at 10:30, so I rush to gather my notes. After that's over, I decide to take an early lunch break because I have errands to run and want to beat the lunchtime traffic. 11:15 a.m. — I run to the mall because I have a sweater to exchange at Banana Republic, but they don't have it in the size I need. I pick out a different top and get a pair of socks that are on sale near the register. The difference is only $2.87. I then return a coat at Sears that I ordered from Lands End. I really like the coat, but the zipper is a pain in the butt. (I read this in the reviews and should have listened!) The girl who does my return said they've been getting so many returned for the same reason. My credit card will be credited $100.55. While at the mall I have to stop by LUSH for a couple bath bombs. They are my weakness. Since I take baths almost nightly, I can't afford to use them all that often, but I like to buy a couple and save them for splurge nights in the tub! I get three and it sets me back $24.85. $27.72 2 p.m. — Back in the office, I finish up my leftover shepherd's pie at my desk. My husband texts me to remind me that we need dog food. I go online to Chewy.com to place an order and decide to get cat food too so that I reach the $50 threshold to get free shipping. I forgot that I have a $20 coupon on my account for a lost item in my last order, so the total is $41.15 after the credit. (Chewy has amazing customer service! Not only did they issue me a refund to my credit card for the lost item, they also gave me a $20 credit for the inconvenience.) $41.15 3:45 p.m. — I leave early to get my son off the bus. The bus is late, per usual. Once J.'s home I make sure he eats a good snack, since he has taekwondo at 5:30 and won't eat dinner until after. He has a banana, yogurt and peanuts, which should tide him over for a bit. I drop him off at the gym and go to a local coffee shop to read. (Sometimes I stay at the gym and watch him, but it's always really loud and I have a bit of headache, so I need peace and quiet.) I order a tea ($2.12) and sit by the window. It's freezing outside, but the sun is warm and the vitamin D lifts my mood and helps my headache! $2.12 6:45 p.m. — Back home I make omelets for dinner for myself and J. (M. works late on Mondays, so he won't be home until after 8). I put spinach, mushrooms, and Swiss in mine, and ham and cheddar in J.'s. We eat them along with bacon and blueberries. We almost always have breakfast for dinner (""brinner"") on Mondays, since it's quick after taekwondo. I clean up while J. does homework. When he's done, I let him play video games for a bit if he reads for 25 minutes first. I break out one of my LUSH bath bombs and relax in the tub. 8:30 p.m. — J. gets ready for bed while I fold laundry. When M. comes home from work, he hangs out in J.'s room and chats with him before bed. We retire to the couch and watch last night's episode of . I'm ready for bed early, but since M. worked late, he's still wound up from the day, so he heads down to the basement to play guitar. Daily Total: $73.65",6,41
"6:30 a.m. — I get to sleep in a little today! I have a doctor's appointment at 9, so I'm going into the office late. I make coffee, feed the animals, and let the dog out. J. wants oatmeal for breakfast, so I help him with that. We make a double batch so M. can have some too. I put mashed banana, cinnamon, honey, and vanilla in it. M. wakes up and is appreciative of his hot breakfast. M. leaves to take J. to school and then head to work, and I finish getting ready and head out myself. 9 a.m. — I get to the doctor on time and wait in the waiting room for a good 20 minutes before being called. Everything is good and I schedule my appointment for my next yearly physical, so I don't forget or skip it! On my way to the work, I stop at the gas station and fill my tank. $26 1 p.m. — My officemate and I head down to the cafeteria to eat lunch (more leftover shepherd's pie). We chat about her recent trip to Spain, and I make a mental note to discuss with M. a savings plan to get to Europe ASAP! 4:45 p.m. — Get ready to head out for the day and change for barre class in the office locker room. I'm taking a quick 40-minute express class at 5:15. M. will pick J. up from his after school club and we should all get home around the same time. While I'm waiting for class to start, I check our bank account and see that M.'s expense reimbursement ($268) was deposited from last month. He was traveling a bit, so had more expenses than normal. We use our joint account for almost everything, but each keep a separate card for work expenses, gifts for each other, and other things like that. I text him to tell him to pay off his card. (I keep track of all of our spending and do 99% of the bill paying, but don't have a log-in for his individual card.) 6:30 p.m. — I pull in the driveway and see that the neighbor's dog is running down the street. He comes running up to me, so I'm able to grab him and walk him home. The owners are so grateful and had no idea that he got out through the fence, AGAIN. Back at the house, the boys have started dinner. We're having leftover chili and cornbread muffins. 9 p.m. — My BFF texts me that she got her credit card bill from when she bought us Justin Timberlake tickets (the concert isn't until October), so I Venmo her what I owe ($150). M. and I decide to not just veg out in front of the TV for once, so he pours us each a glass of wine and we sit and chat and research a long weekend vacation destination for the summer. We're thinking either Chicago or Montreal, but then table that discussion, because we decide to include J. in the planning. We also want to start planning an adults only, all-inclusive trip for next spring, since M. will turn 40 next year. After looking at beautiful resorts for an hour and reading a bunch of reviews, we've narrowed it down to three. I email a friend who's a travel agent to see if she has any thoughts or other suggestions, and ask what kind of prices she can get us. $150 11 p.m. — We head to bed to dream about palm trees and white sand beaches! I wash my face, do my nightly skincare routine, and fall asleep as soon as my head hits the pillow. Daily Total: $176",7,41
"8:15 a.m. — I wake up very confused. Normally my husband, N., wakes me up at 7 a.m. so that I can take over baby duty while he gets ready for work. But he surprises me by taking the day off work today! I've been having a rough time lately, so this is a very sweet surprise. I have a quick shower and feed the baby while N. makes coffee. 10 a.m. — I take the baby to the mother's group we're in. The twelve of us all have babies the same age. We meet every Tuesday morning at a cute little coffee shop in the neighborhood, and it's a great source of support for all of us. We chat about how our weeks have been going, and I order a long black with a splash of milk on the side ($3.08), plus an egg and bacon roll with tomato chutney ($8.48). $11.56 11 a.m. — Baby has been in teething hell the last couple of weeks, and today is no exception. He's grumpy and unsettled, so we leave the mother's group after an hour. He goes down for a nap and I get ready to head out for a run. I'm training for a half marathon in May, so I run three times a week, as well as cross-train. I listen to , a true crime podcast, while I run. 1:45 p.m. — Well, that run didn't go as planned. I meant to do 10 kilometers but hit a mental wall at six and just couldn't do anymore. I ended up half walking and half jogging the four kilometers back to my car. I try not to beat myself up too much about it. I'm still recovering from a traumatic birth, and some days are going to be tougher than others. I drive home and make ham and veggie sandwiches on wheat bread for N. and me. 6 p.m. — After an afternoon of family time, the baby gets fed, bathed, and changed into his pajamas. N. reads to him from and puts him to bed while I take the dog for a walk and listen to the podcast. 7:30 p.m. — I marinated chicken overnight, so I whip up a nice butter chicken sauce and simmer the whole thing. We eat it with brown rice and steamed broccoli and each have a glass of home-brew beer while watching a trashy reality cooking competition. We have a group chat with our friends who live out of town about the show, and it's always hilarious. N. and I are both still peckish, so I make cinnamon sugar popcorn for a snack. 9 p.m. — N. cleans up the kitchen while I feed the dog and cat and we go up to bed. I do my simple routine of Cetaphil cleanser, witch hazel toner, and jojoba oil. I usually read until the baby wakes up for his feed at 10 or so, but I'm too tired to do anything but scroll through Reddit. 10 p.m. — I feed the baby and fall asleep soon after. Daily Total: $11.56",1,42
"6 a.m. — The little human alarm clock is babbling away. N. gets up to do the morning feed. I only got up with the baby once during the night last night, so I actually feel fairly refreshed today and can't fall back asleep. I head downstairs to make myself a coffee. 7:30 a.m. — N. leaves for work and the baby goes for a morning snooze. I quickly shower, moisturize and dress. I make myself oatmeal topped with chopped apple, almond butter, and cinnamon, and another coffee. I read Money Diaries while I eat. Baby wakes up at 8:30 and we do our usual feed, play, sing, and read routine. 10 a.m. — Nap time. I feel very fortunate that the baby has turned out to be a good sleeper. I make two pieces of wheat toast with cream cheese and cucumbers, but I am a bottomless pit of breastfeeding hunger, so it does nothing to fill me up. I scramble up a couple eggs and top them with feta. I prepare a couple bottles, vacuum, and clean the cat's litter while listening to the podcast. (True crime is definitely my thing!) 12 p.m. — My mother-in-law arrives to spend time with the baby. (My in-laws live about an hour away across the city.) Not only do I get a little time to myself, but the baby loves playing with different family and friends. 1:30 p.m. — I haven't had my nails done at a salon in over a year, so I get an SNS manicure that will hopefully last a while ($34.60). I feel like a new woman! I stop at the pharmacy to get more jojoba oil for my face ($15.38) and also pick up tomatoes, red capsicums, bread, and a bar of Cadbury hazelnut chocolate ($6.36) at the supermarket. I snack on the chocolate on the way home. $56.34 2 p.m. — Mother-in-law brought over groceries for lunch. I make myself a roll with mayo, mustard, roast chicken, tomato, and avocado. I inhale it and immediately make myself another one. I have never been as hungry in my life as these last six months. 4:30 p.m. — Mother-in-law leaves and I doze with the baby for about an hour and wake up parched. I chug water while I chop up a butternut pumpkin to roast with olive oil and maple syrup. I'm Canadian, and my love of maple syrup knows no bounds. 6 p.m. — N. is home and gets in baby time while I finish making dinner. He handles the bedtime routine while I walk the dog and listen to . 7:30 p.m. — We eat butternut pumpkin soup with a glass of home brew while watching more trashy TV and group texting with our friends. I have a cup of tea and cookies for dessert. 9 p.m. — N. cleans the kitchen, I feed the animals, and then we head up to bed. I do my skincare routine and read by Joel Dicker. I just started it and it's good! Baby gets his feed at 10:30 p.m. and I dive back into bed to sleep. Daily Total: $56.34",2,42
"7 a.m. — N. wakes me up with a coffee and a baby. I was up at 1 a.m. and 4 a.m. to do night feeds, but other than that slept pretty well last night. N. leaves for work as I do the baby thing. 8:30 a.m. — Baby naps. I dress and make myself scrambled eggs and toast with cream cheese and cucumbers. I message with a couple friends about organizing a kid-free night to check out a new Viking restaurant that's opening. We also want to go to the new Harry Potter escape room. I read my book until the baby wakes up. 10:30 a.m. — Time for Kangatraining! This is our weekly mum and baby fitness class. It's a combination of core work, strength training, and cardio with your baby strapped on your chest in a carrier. It's a great workout and good cross-training for running. The babies love it, too, and they almost always fall asleep in the carriers! It feels so good to work up a sweat! (I paid for the whole term last month.) 12 p.m. — Back home, and I'm famished. I make a chicken, avocado, and tomato roll and heat up leftover butternut pumpkin soup. I feed the baby while watching a true crime show on Netflix  and snacking on some chocolate. 3:30 p.m. — It's autumn here, but the weather still feels like summer. It's too nice to stay inside, so the baby and I drive a couple suburbs over to go thrift shopping. I changed my mind about a jacket I had bought, so I exchange it for a cool pair of distressed jeans. Clothes shopping for my post-baby body has been emotional, so I'm pleased to finally find a pair of pants I like. I pay the difference between the items ($2.33). $2.33 5 p.m. — I stop at the supermarket for popcorn seeds ($1.16) and a cheesy-mite scroll to snack on ($1.55). $2.71 7:30 p.m. — N. is hosting clients in the VIP box at the first game of the AFL season tonight, so I'm on my own until late. I do the baby's bedtime routine and make a big pan of lentil, walnut, veggie, and quinoa burritos. I top them off with salsa and Monterey jack cheese, and then bake in the oven. Yum. I watch the footy game as I eat, clean the kitchen, and feed the animals. 9 p.m. — I head upstairs and work my muscles on the foam roller before doing my skincare routine and lying in bed. Baby sleeps through his last feed and I fall asleep before N. gets home. Daily Total: $5.04",3,42
"8:30 a.m. — Since N. hosted clients last night, he doesn't have to go into the office until noon today. We share early morning feeding duties and I get to sleep in a bit. 10 a.m. — We have a lazy family morning drinking coffee and playing with the baby. I make oatmeal with a chopped up apple, almond butter, and cinnamon. N.'s paycheck comes in and we're pleasantly surprised to see it's a little higher than normal. His first commission has come through! We transfer some of it over to our savings and give ourselves each little extra spending money. 12 p.m. — Baby naps for longer than usual, so after N. leaves for work I read up on baby sleep techniques from a library book I checked out. I'm going back to work in a few months, and we need to start working on weaning off night feeds. That's the dream! I heat up a leftover burrito for lunch. 1 p.m. — I go to the pharmacy to pick up my prescription ($14.51). I have major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety order and I've taken antidepressants for years to keep everything in balance. I'm happy prescriptions are generally very affordable in Australia. $14.51 1:30 p.m. — I sunscreen up and do a five kilometer run along the ocean with the baby in the pram while listening to S . 2 p.m. — Finish my run and find enough coins in the nappy bag to buy a vanilla soft serve cone from an ice cream truck. I eat it, and then strap the baby in the carrier and wade into the water up to my knees. What an exquisite feeling after a run! $2.33 6 p.m. — N. is home and we do the baby bedtime routine. One of the best parts of my day is reading to the baby before we put him in bed. A freshly bathed and pajama-ed cuddly baby is a wonderful thing. 7:30 p.m. — I take the dog for a walk around the neighborhood while listening to . We eat leftover burritos with oven chips. N. is the oven chip master! We rent on the PlayStation Network and settle in for a movie night. $4.62 11 p.m. — The movie isn't great but not terrible either. N. feeds the animals, and I feed the baby, do my skincare, and flop into bed. Daily Total: $21.46",4,42
"8:30 a.m. — It's the weekend! N. takes the morning baby shift and I sleep in. I was only up once in the night, which is always a good thing. 10 a.m. — I have a coffee while doing our weekly grocery oder. I make my meal plan and grocery list on Fridays and put in the order for pick up on Saturday afternoons. Shopping online saves me loads of time and pretty much eliminates any impulse buys. I put the order through on N.'s Acorn app; he gets 50 cents in his account for each order. It's not much, but at the end of the year it's an extra $26, so I'll take it. $63.67 12 p.m. — It's torrentially raining with thunder, so today turns into a family hangout and deep cleaning day. The pup tolerates a shower while giving serious sad eyes. We tackle several loads of laundry and I make a batch of carrot cupcakes, since I'm having some girls over for a birthday tea tomorrow. 2:30 p.m. — The weather has cleared up, so I head out by myself for a run. I do eight kilometers on my favorite route by the ocean while listening to 3:30 p.m. — I feel phenomenal after my run. I really needed it. I get a text from the grocery store that my order is ready for pick-up, so I swing by the supermarket on the way home. We paid for the order this morning when the order went through. N. calls and lets me know that we're almost out of formula, so I pick up a tin as well. It's on sale too! I stop at the liquor store on my way out and pick up wine and beer. $34.50 7 p.m. — We do the bedtime routine and put the baby to bed. I make a stir-fry with onion, carrots, red capsicum, broccoli, and egg in a spicy almond butter sauce over egg noodles. We eat this once a week; it's delicious. We settle in front of the TV with beers to watch AFL. 10:30 p.m. — I had a couple drinks, so to be on the safe side, I give the baby a bottle for his last feed instead of breastfeeding, do my skincare, and go to sleep. Daily Total: $98.17",5,42
"7:30 a.m. — Wake up and have coffee with N. and the baby. I did the 2:30 a.m. feed and N. got up at 5:30 a.m. 9 a.m. — Shower, do my hair, dress, and start prepping food for my birthday tea. I bake scones, and make cream cheese icing for the carrot cupcakes, whip cream, and tea sandwiches (roast beef with horse radish, cream cheese with cucumber and goat cheese with pickled beetroot). I get the table set with my nice china and head upstairs to do my makeup. 11 a.m. — The girls arrive and give me a few lovely gifts. Unexpected but much appreciated! We pop open a bottle of champagne and toast to my birthday (which is really next week), then get down to eating, chatting, and cuddling the baby. 2 p.m. — The girls leave and the baby goes for a nap. My sister-in-law brought over four huge boxes of baby clothes that her son has outgrown. Almost all of the baby's clothes are hand-me-downs from friends and family, which has saved us a whole heap of money. Babies grow so quickly that all the clothes are in excellent condition, and in some cases brand new. N. and I spend the afternoon sorting through the clothes while watching more AFL. 5 p.m. — I take the dog for a walk around the neighborhood while listening to . It's a lovely warm evening. 7 p.m. — I feed and bathe the baby and read him while N. makes dinner. After the baby is settled in bed, we eat dinner. Tonight is steak with spinach, apple, walnut, and goat cheese salad in a mustard vinaigrette, with sweet potato mash and peas. It's all fantastic. 9 p.m. — Kitchen is cleaned and animals are fed, so we head up to bed and I do my skincare routine. It's now pouring (gotta love that dramatically changing Melbourne weather) and we lay in the dark listening to the rain and a audiobook and chatting. Baby has his 10:30 p.m. feed and then I crawl back into my nice warm bed. Daily Total: $0",6,42
"7 a.m. — N. wakes me out of a deep sleep with a baby and a coffee. I didn't sleep well, so I'm struggling to open my eyes. 8 a.m. — I make another coffee and eat oatmeal with chopped up apple, almond butter, and cinnamon. We're nearly out of almond butter so I add it to my Costco list. We do a big Costco trip for things like nappies, wipes, non-perishables, and meats for the freezer at the start of each month, which is coming up next week. 10 a.m. — Baby naps, and I do some online window shopping. I'm on a reduced salary for my maternity leave, and we still want to save as much as we can, so we give ourselves a limited amount of “fun” money each month. I've become good at planning out and budgeting for my future purchases. We're going to Hawaii this summer for my dad's 70th birthday, and I need a new bathing suit. I'm also on the hunt for matching knit beanies for myself, N., and the baby (no shame, I'm a dork and I love it!), and black leather Chelsea boots. I shop vintage and thrift stores as much as possible, but some things just shouldn't be bought used! I find some good options and bookmark them for later. 11 a.m. — Baby eats his lunch and I eat the last leftover burrito. We bundle up and head out to the zoo. We have an annual membership which gives us unlimited access to all three zoos in Victoria. We have a short but pleasant visit since it's chilly and windy and we're getting intermittent showers. 2 p.m. — Back home. I eat a toasted ham and veggie sandwich with a spinach, beetroot, and goat cheese salad. Baby takes another nap and I putter around tidying the house. 3 p.m. — I make a cup of tea and eat an unfrosted carrot cupcake while scrolling through social media and various shopping websites. Baby is the joy of my life and I like staying home with him, but I also can't wait to get back to my job, which I love, and a bigger paycheck, which I also love! 7 p.m. — N. does the bedtime routine and I take the dog for a walk while listening to 7:30 p.m. — Leftover steak, salad, and oven chips for dinner while watching garbage TV. I have a glass of white wine. We clean up, feed the animals, and go up to bed. Skincare done, baby gets a feed at 10:30, and I fall asleep. Daily Total: $0",7,42
"6:20 a.m. — I'm up early today, since I'm commuting into D.C. for work. I do my normal morning routine (brush teeth, micellar water on face, toner, serum, sunscreen, moisturizer, and tinted moisturizer with SPF). I make sure I have my Metro card and a full water bottle and am out of the house within 20 minutes. I ride my bike to the train station, buy my ticket ($8) and am told it's delayed 10 more minutes. Blah. I waste my time on the train by listening to Release Radar and Discover Weekly on Spotify. ($8 expensed) 8:30 a.m. — I stop at my favorite French pastry shop to pick up a pain au chocolat. I hop on the Metro (expensed) and it's packed. It's an emergency nightmare scenario. I have nothing to hold onto and accept that I'll bump into those around because there's no space. I finally hop off and walk the few blocks to the office. $3.77 1:30 p.m. — Finally time for lunch. I brought in couscous with mixed veggies and eat at my desk while I work. 5 p.m. — I leave work and stop by the bakery again to pick up three ""merveilleux"" pastries for my roommates and I to split. (I Venmo request them for their shares.) I hop on the Metro (expensed) and stop by the Tidal Basin to see the cherry blossoms. They're pretty, but don't quite meet the expectations I had of them. I hop back on the Metro and take it back to Union Station, where I catch the train back to Baltimore (again, expensed). $5.50 6:40 p.m. — I'm finally back in Baltimore. I ride my bike home and pray the sweets don't get squished...20 minutes later, they are but I'm sitting on the couch with my roommates eating them anyway and catching up. We talk about our weekend plans and make dinner together. It's a super grownup meal of mac and cheese and smoothies (avocado, banana, mixed berries, and coconut water). 8 p.m. — I prep my bag for tomorrow, fold old laundry, and finish the night with a cup of tea and an episode of with my roommates. I'm asleep by 10:30. Daily Total: $9.27",1,43
"6:30 a.m. — I'm up early again and not into this routine. I set my alarm back another hour but am awake five minutes later, so I get my act together and go to my barre class. I'm out of the house within 10 minutes and ride my bike to class. 8 a.m. — The hour-long class is over, yay! It was harder than normal because my body was not interested in moving this morning. I take a shower at the gym and get ready for the day, which takes about 20 minutes. Then I ride my bike over to the grocery store to pick up yogurt for breakfast. $3.56 12 p.m. — Free lunch at work today! I love free lunch days. 5 p.m. — I leave work and walk over to a local ice cream shop that's having their opening day of the season. This means a free ice cream cone. I listen to more music on Spotify and feel sad that I don't have a romantic partner. I think I'm great and try to put myself out there, but it just doesn't pan out. I had two abusive ex-boyfriends that destroyed part of me and fueled negative thoughts about how I don't deserve to find love or be worthy of it. The ice cream and walk help to clear my mind of that negative self-destructive train of thought. 7 p.m. — I make a quick smoothie and run out the door to take a Lyft to meet a friend for drinks in Mount Vernon. $8.93 7:30 p.m. — We chat for three hours and catch up on life since we last saw each other two years ago. I have two cocktails and then we head back to his place to drink a few more beers. We talk a lot about sexuality, sexual norms, dating apps, and other fun stuff I love to openly discuss. I talk about how I'm continually disappointed with dating and still hurting from the last guy I dated. It's a good conversation and I could have stayed all night chatting about my interests and desires for experimentation. $27 11 p.m. — I Lyft home, do my normal bedtime routine, and am asleep within 10 minutes. $9.60 Daily Total: $49.09",2,43
"7:15 a.m. — I'm up before my alarm goes off, so I snuggle under the covers for as long as possible and read through emails. I make a smoothie to drink as I walk and get into the office by 8:30. I spend most of the morning listening to New Music Friday on Spotify, a playlist I look forward to every week, while I work. 2 p.m. — I eat leftover pasta and think about how slowly the day is moving and how badly I want it to be the weekend. Is that sad to say? I'd love to feel more excitement about everything at all times of the day, but I'm tired. 5 p.m. — I leave work and walk 20 minutes to the nail salon. I had a shitty week because my sort of boyfriend (the fun in-between phase) ended things, so I want to find a small source of joy like getting pretty nails. My manicurist and I talk about food dishes we've been making recently and she infuses me with positive energy. While I'm getting my nails done, I miss two calls from my long distance BFFs. I promise to call them this weekend and walk over to the grocery store to meet my roommates. We're buying ingredients for tacos tonight and walk home together after. $37 7 p.m. — The veggie tacos are delicious! I make us Pimm's Cups and we sit around and talk until midnight. I chug a glass of water before bed, wash my face, brush my teeth, and pass out. Daily Total: $37",3,43
"8 a.m. — Despite drinking last night, my body wills me awake at this hour and I lay in bed listening to music. I end up cleaning for a few hours, Facetiming with one of my long-distance BFFs, and trying on different clothes in my closet. I should study for class, but I decide not to. (I'm getting my Master's, very slowly and part-time. I get partial tuition-remission, and the remainder of my tuition is paid for with money my parents set aside for me.) 12 p.m. — At drag brunch with friends! I order bottomless mimosas and huevos rancheros. The food is subpar, but the company is great. There's a dance contest halfway through brunch and I'm nominated from our table. I dance to Beyonce's ""Crazy in Love"" and win! $38 2 p.m. — We walk to a block party happening a few streets over. They've shut down the street and have a live band, unlimited oysters, and multiple bars, so it's a fun time. It's $10 to enter; my roommate pays and I immediately Venmo her for me. We get inside and a friend buys me an Orange Crush. Other friends and boys buy me drinks until I'm finally ready to leave. $10 7 p.m. — Leave the block party feeling pretty drunk. I walk home with my roommate and we order pizza on GrubHub. We devour it and stay up until midnight talking about life, our expectations, our families, and other normal drunk chat topics. I begrudgingly drunk text my sort of ex. When he responds, I decide to be smart and not reply, even though I want to hook up. $18.08 12 a.m. — I chug water, brush my teeth, wash my face, and head to bed. Daily Total: $66.08",4,43
"8:30 a.m. — I'm up early again. I clean my room and waste time in bed for a hour watching until I commit to going to barre class. I ride my bike there and arrive in time for the 10:30 class. It's an hour of pure exhaustion, but I love it and feel no hangover after. 11:30 a.m. — I walk over to the grocery store to buy red peppers, green peppers, bananas, cara cara oranges, crumbled goat cheese, rye bread, yogurt, gnocchi, and soup ($29.17). Then I hang out in the seating area of the grocery store and eat my soup while I chat with the other long-distance BFF. I love talking to her and it fills me with such a sense of rejuvenation. $29.17 12:30 p.m. — I ride my bike from the grocery store to a coffee shop to meet my roommate for tea. We talk about last night, regrettable choices, and how to talk to a mutual friend about potentially dangerous alcoholic tendencies. I ride my bike home. $2 2 p.m. — I roast veggies in the oven and feel gross because I haven't showered yet. Instead of showering, I to go to Target and Michaels with my roommates. I buy jalapeño ranch Ruffles, milk, heavy whipping cream, and eggs ($11), a frame for a painting, laundry detergent, toilet bowl cleaner, and shower scrubber refill ($20), a tennis racket and tennis balls ($20), and two sports bras ($35). I buy the tennis gear because my roommate and I have been wanting to use the courts at the park near our house. We then stop at a hardware store to buy another recycling bin (because our current bin always overflows) and a rosemary plant ($10). $96 4:30 p.m. — I'm back home and make a veggie, goat cheese, and pesto sandwich. I heat it on the stove, and it's delicious. My roommate and I make tiramisu and then head to our rooftop to do gardening, since it's beautiful outside. We come back inside and start rearranging other furniture, and then I put away some of the veggie sandwich supplies to bring into work for lunch tomorrow. 7 p.m. — I take a shower and get in my cozy clothes for the night. My roommate and I agree on watching We're in bed by 11 and I fall asleep reminding myself that I should always try to look as fabulous as the women in that movie do. Daily Total: $127.17",5,43
"7:20 a.m. — I'm up before my alarm again so I read the news in bed and write down my dreams. Anytime I remember my dream I create a note to remember how ridiculous it was. I am out of the house by 8 after following my normal morning routine and eating a yogurt. I listen to the new Cardi B album while walking to work. 1 p.m. — Work goes by quickly today because I'm distraction-free. While I eat my grilled veggie sandwich for lunch, I research stocks to invest in. I'm trying to educate myself, since this seems like something I should start knowing about for my future savings. 5 p.m. — Leave work and walk to the gym for a barre class. The class is 45 minutes and exhausting, but the teacher thanks us for coming and doing this instead of happy hour. After reading a recent Money Diary, I'm inspired to make miso soup with veggie dumplings. So I buy miso soup packets, zucchini, onion, red pepper, green pepper, edamame, and frozen broccoli. The food will last me multiple meals, since I'll make pasta primavera with the remaining veggies. $19.17 7 p.m. — Miso soup is delish! I found two recipes online, so I combined them to be a bit more spicy, with fried dumplings for the crunch. I made a smoothie to go along with it since I haven't had enough fruit today. I call my dad and we catch up while I eat. 9 p.m. — One of the roommates is going away for a long weekend, so we insist on her giving us a fashion show. It ends up being a lot longer than expected, but it's a funnier way to waste a night with friends. I pack my bag for tomorrow, shower, watch the most recent episode of , and try to fall asleep by 11 p.m. I stay up for another half hour feeling sad and lonely. I contemplate re-downloading dating apps, but decide against it. I realized that I meet plenty of people in person and have not successfully dated anyone from an app. Daily Total: $19.17",6,43
"6:30 a.m. — I'm awake before my alarm goes off. I pre-packed my bag to go to the gym but can't force myself out of bed knowing how cold it is outside. I lay in bed and half-sleep through weird dreams until it's 7:30 a.m. I finally resign myself to leave bed and shower. Since I planned to go to the gym today, I didn't wash my hair last night and as a result, it's a frizzy mess. I shower quickly and am out the door by 8. My roommate drops me off on her way to work, so I'm in the office by 8:15. I eat my yogurt and banana once I'm in the office. 12 p.m. — I had meetings all morning, so I savor this time to catch up on all my favorite websites while I eat lunch. I make another grilled veggie panini with the goat cheese and pesto. People in the kitchen tell me it smells delicious and I smile knowing I will devour it. 5 p.m. — I leave work and walk over to meet one of my roommates at work. She drives us about 20 minutes outside of the city for my first Yelp Elite Event. It's an escape room with pizza! It's a fun and frustrating night that I wouldn't do again with strangers. I've done an escape room before and loved it, but this time it was frustrating because I knew the code and wasn't being listened to. Roommate and I stop at HomeGoods on the way home. She picks up a few things for herself and I buy a beach towel for the summer. $7.97 10 p.m. — I'm exhausted, but can't resist having more of the tiramisu. I have a bit, do my normal nighttime routine, and watch an episode of before going to sleep at 11. Daily Total: $7.97",7,43
"8 a.m. — It's my first day of work at my new job!! I am currently finishing up my BA (depression and anxiety got the best of me in my early 20s, which prevented me from finishing school at the time), so I'm taking advantage of my spring break to get some hours in at my new law firm. I shower, take my son out to pee in the yard (he's a rescue dog I brought home about five years ago), and then hit the road. No coffee at home today because my work has a great coffee and snack selection. 10 a.m. — Clock into work and get down to learning the ins and outs of probate law. I'm replacing an attorney, so I have a lot to learn and very big shoes to fill. 4 p.m. — Head out for the day feeling overwhelmed but super happy. My boss is great and the environment is so wonderful. I head to the gym at my university, which is about 10 minutes from my office. Gotta take advantage of this tuition money! 7 p.m. — I stop at the Publix by my place and grab rotisserie chicken, salad mix, and hummus. I throw together a salad as my dog whines for food. Exhausted from the day, I read from my current book, . I'm taking a creative writing class this semester, which requires us to read at least 50 pages a week from a fiction book. I am very happy with this homework, as I love reading. I'm passed out by 10 p.m. with my dog as the little spoon. $20 Daily Total: $20",1,44
"8 a.m. — Another day at the office! Same routine: shower, take the dog out, and then hit the road. I usually lay my clothes out the night before and put on minimal makeup during the weekdays, so I get ready pretty quickly. I'm almost never hungry in the mornings, so I don't bring breakfast, but I grab a nutrition bar from the office whenever I get hungry. 12 p.m. — I leave the office to grab lunch. I wander around the area, checking out shops and cute boutiques while munching on a sandwich and chips I bought from a random café. I like to walk around during my off time and try to get in at least two miles of steps before I hit the gym in the evenings. $15 4 p.m. — Leave the office and stop to get gas. My car is great on gas, and I travel so little with work and school so close to me. I fill it up maybe once every two weeks. Then, I head to the university gym to get weight training and cardio in. I sit down so much at work and when I do homework that I like to get in exercise in at least four to five times a week. $25 10 p.m. — I have a light dinner, so I'm hungry again by 10 and grab an apple with peanut butter. I let my dog lick peanut butter off my finger and he goes wild. Some friends text me to make plans for the weekend. I started school in August to finish my BA and have been super committed to my schoolwork, so they understand that I don't really go out during the weekdays, even if it's spring break. I feel like I'm very behind everyone because I have a three-year gap in my education, but I know it's all in my head and it's just me beating myself up for something I really had no control over (depression is the worst). I am now on Prozac and have done a lot of self-reflection in the years since my mental health crisis. I'm still working through the anger I feel at myself. I called my university health center to make an appointment last week, but they're taking forever to get back to me. I make a note in my planner to shoot them an email to ask for an update.

"8 a.m. — Same old, same old. My parents are in my hometown of L.A., so they're three hours behind me. I wake up to ""good night"" texts from them both like I usually do, so I take time to respond to them. They've been so supportive of my going back to school and moving back across the country to Georgia to complete my BA at the same school where I started and putting my life back together. I am truly lucky to have them. 12 p.m. — My boss in L.A. emails to let me know they need me to complete a case in 24 hours. Naturally, I freak out a bit. Sometimes they'll throw super tight deadlines at me and while I always make them, it's a mad rush of adrenaline until I get it all done. I'm paid on a case-by-case basis, so the amount of time I put into a case isn't taken into account. They know I'm also just starting my job in Atlanta, but clearly must be really scrambling for this case to be done. I spend my lunch hour eating a very expensive slice of Oreo cheesecake ($8) and outlining my case notes. $8 5 p.m. — I'm home and choose to skip the gym so I can work on the case. The L.A. firm will send me scanned files with all the information I need, along with the contact info of the client so I can call if I have any questions. 10 p.m. — My dog is watching me from the comfort of bed as I continue to work on the case. I have it mostly finished and will do the finishing touches in the morning. The three-hour time difference helps me a lot. Daily Total: $8",3,44
"7 a.m. — I'm up earlier than usual to get this case done. I send it in and let them know that I'm available to make edits if they need me to. Now it's time to get ready for work. On the way to the office, I stop and grab a bagel breakfast sandwich from one of my favorite spots called Kavarna. The people there are so nice, and they always have cool new art on the walls. $5 5 p.m. — I go straight from the office to bed. I'm too exhausted for the gym. With two days in a row of no gym, I know I'm going to have to go tomorrow. I get up for a second to get my gym bag ready, put my clothes out, and wash my face. I end my nighttime routine with witch hazel toner and slather my face in Aquaphor. The weather in Atlanta has been so windy and cold these past few days. My skin has taken a beating, but Aquaphor helps me feel like I have a brand new face. I force my dog to cuddle with me and we both fall asleep immediately. Daily Total: $5",4,44
"8:30 a.m. — It's Friday!!! I sleep in a bit later than usual to get my body back to full health. I spent my early 20s partying hard (which did not help my depression) and now I feel like my body is very susceptible to any changes in my schedule. It takes me a while to get back on track, but I feel a lot better after getting sleep. 12 p.m. — The new boss takes us all out for lunch at this hip spot across the street called Leon's. It's really great food and we spend lunch talking about politics, gun control, dating, and my other coworker's wedding plans. The conversation is great, and I fall even more in love with my job. It took a couple months of applying and interviewing to find it and I'm so grateful every day that I did. 3:30 p.m. — I get out of work early with my first paycheck in hand. We get paid weekly and with a company check that we deposit ourselves. Thankfully, taxes are taken out of it already. I had a job a couple years ago that did not take taxes out and I am still paying it off. I have less than $1,000 to go! It's been really hard to be in school and keep up with my payments. Before this Atlanta job, my L.A. job barely covered all my expenses. I depended on my family a lot and have plans to pay them back in the future. I stop by Publix to grab a big bottle of wine to have a glass as I get ready for dinner with friends. $12 6 p.m. — We go to a new Italian spot for dinner and laugh the night away. Because I spend so much time alone, I like to meet up with people at least once a week. I'm still trying to find a balance between being self-reliant and isolating myself. I hug everyone goodbye around 9 p.m. and head home to care for my dog-son who is up waiting for me. I sit on the front porch as he zigzags around the yard, loving his freedom. I chat with my roommates (I live with two guys my age) and then put on in the background to fall asleep to. $25 Daily Total: $37",5,44
"10 a.m. — I roll out of bed and get my workout clothes on. It's time to make up for lost time!! First things first, I head to the park near my place with my dog. I know it's not the best idea, but I never put him on a leash. I like to let him wander and he follows behind me at all times. We walk for a couple hours. I wave hi and say good morning to all the other walkers out there. I love how friendly Atlanta is. 1 p.m. — I drop off my dog at home and grab food to hold me over for a while before I go to the gym. I swipe into my university gym with my student ID and get to work. I stay longer than usual to make up for lost time and because I can feel my body is a little slower than it normally is. I listen to podcasts as I go through my workout. I have so many episodes to catch up on! 5 p.m. — I start to get ready for my friend's party tonight. I make dinner plans with another friend to hang out with before the party. We decide to meet at 7, which means I need to hop in the shower right away. I have so much hair that it takes me forever to wash and style it. 7 p.m. — My friend is late, so I order a beer and peruse the menu as I wait. Waiters take turns sitting with me because my friend is taking so long. I swear to them that I am not being stood up and that I do in fact have someone else arriving. Thirty minutes later, she shows up and I tell her about the whole debacle. We have a good laugh and catch up on old times. I haven't seen her in about a month because I just had midterms and hid myself for a while. She orders ceviche; I get tostones and a salad. It's all delicious. By the time we finish, my friends are blowing up my phone because it's almost 11 p.m. and they want me to hurry up and get to the party already. We pay separately. $31 1 a.m. — We get to the party and immediately take jello shots. I talk to friends I haven't seen in a while and snuggle with the French bulldog my friend is dogsitting for the weekend. We decide to head out to nearby bars and grab a Lyft there. I buy a beer and talk to people. My ex and I broke up six months ago, so I'm trying to get back out there. I walk around looking for a cute guy to chat up. I like to just go up to guys and start talking – they're almost always happy I made the first move. On my way to talk to a guy, I'm sidelined by another guy who starts talking to me. We have a nice chat, but he's so obviously drunk that I start to feel uncomfortable. I excuse myself and head to the next bar with my friends. $6 2 a.m. — My friends decide to head out, but I still want to see if I meet anyone. I stay behind with friends of a friend I don't know too well, but who are super nice. As I'm walking outside with them to the back porch, I meet a guy. He's super cute, so we chat for a while and really hit it off. He offers to buy me a drink, so I head into the bar with him. He buys me a beer and he buys himself a beer and a shot. He takes the shot of whiskey like it's nothing. (Am I just old?? I can't take shots like that anymore.) He invites me home and I say yes. 3 a.m. — He pays for our Lyft to his place and we talk to the driver the whole way there. She's hilarious and can tell what we're up to for the night. We get to his place (and it's a beautiful apartment that he lives in alone – did I mention he's a corporate lawyer? I think I chose the wrong kind of law to practice) and get down to business, but either because he's drunk or just dumb, he doesn't want to use a condom. I immediately put an end to it and rip into him about this. He accepts my lecture and tells me I'm completely right about being annoyed with him. Placated, we cuddle and go to bed. Daily Total: $37",6,44
"7 a.m. — I wake up in Bar Guy's bed. I'm still annoyed about the whole condom thing – who does that?? But he's so sweet and apologetic in the morning that I can't help but ease up. I tell him I need to get home to take care of my dog, and he offers to drive me home even though I'm a good 30 minutes away from him. Worried he might still be buzzed or drunk, I tell him he's sweet but that I'll grab a Lyft ($13). We make plans to hang out later in the week. $13 9 a.m. — Finally home! I take my dog out and then immediately get into bed. I put water by my bed for when I wake up and don't open my eyes again until 2 p.m. 5 p.m. — After lounging about in bed for a few hours, I finally get up and make pasta with chicken and veggies. After eating, I feel much more alive and start to plan out my week. School starts back up tomorrow! Daily Total: $13",7,44
"6 a.m. — Good morning! I'm off to a painfully early WundaBar Reformer class to start the day. Reformer is expensive AF, but I use ClassPass, so it's covered. Pretty much every workout class in LA is $28 (lol wut), which makes a ClassPass subscription a no-brainer. 7 a.m. — There's a Starbucks next door and I *did* wake up at 5:15 a.m. to get to this class on time, so I stop in for a venti blonde latte with coconut milk. I hoard Starbucks gift cards for situations like this, so my latte is covered. I also have a free coffee on my rewards app, but I like to save those for days when I'm feeling especially broke and desperate for a treat. I take my Starbucks home to quickly shower and watch last night's episode of while I get dressed. 8:30 a.m. — I stop for gas on the way to work and then call my mom. My mom and I are super close and talk every morning while I drive to work. I'm from the East Coast and don't see my family often, so it's nice to have a set routine to keep in touch. $30 9 a.m. — I make a bowl of oatmeal and hurriedly try to eat it. I'm in a video shoot for most of today, so I'm trying to knock out all of my emails before I'm totally unavailable for four hours. 10 a.m. — Video time! We hired an outside videographer to knock out a few training and marketing videos with our CEO. If I'm being totally candid here, I'm super grateful for this shoot. This guy I've hooked up with a few times is randomly my company's client now. He's coming into the office during the shoot, and I'm glad I have somewhere to hide. (And if you're this dude reading my Money Diary: Hi. Sorry we haven't talked. I miss your dog.) 2 p.m. — PLOT TWIST. The guy sends his business partners to the meeting instead, so he isn't coming in after all. Phew. I feel way less stressed now. We're done with our video shoot, too, so I heat up leftover broccoli/cauliflower casserole for lunch. 5:30 p.m. — I have to go straight to West L.A. for a meeting after work, so I swing by Taco Bell to pick up dinner. I fucking LOVE Taco Bell. It's the most vegan-friendly fast food restaurant (I'm vegan) and I could bathe in their Mild Sauce. I get two spicy potato tacos with added beans and a bean burrito. I order both Fresco-style, which basically just means ""vegan with added salsa."" $6 6:30 p.m. — Meeting time! I'm on the Associate Board of a nonprofit that serves L.A.'s homeless population and we have monthly meetings to talk about L.A.'s homelessness issues and plan projects. We're in the process of planning new project pitches right now (say that five times fast...), so this meeting is a mix of roundtable discussion and brainstorming in groups. The meeting ends around 9, and then I head home to curl up with a book and go to sleep. Daily Total: $36",1,45
"8 a.m. — Why am I so tired again?!?! I seriously never get coffee this often, but I'm half asleep today. I grab another venti blonde latte with coconut milk from Starbucks on the way to work. I miraculously still have about $10 left on my Starbucks card. Dope. 9 a.m. — In order to have time for Starbucks, I had to forego the usual oatmeal today, instead grabbing an avocado and two pieces of Ezekiel bread on the way out the door this morning. I turn it into avocado toast once I'm at work and top it with leftover Mild sauce packets from last night's Taco Bell. So millennial. 11 a.m. — My best friend and I go to Barry's Bootcamp class almost every Tuesday (butt and leg day!), but she has to bail this week, so we look for a class to take together Thursday. I'm pretty sure I'd snap in half if I did more than one Barry's in a week, so we sign up for a ""Drag Ride"" at Flywheel West Hollywood. I pray ""Drag"" means Drag Queen-themed, but I don't get my hopes up. Class is covered by ClassPass. 1 p.m. — One of my favorite coworkers works remotely in the Pacific Northwest, but she's in town this week! We head to a poke place that has tofu and grab poke bowls. Mine is $8 and some change, but I use the Digit app, so all of my purchases are rounded up, with the change heading into my savings account. $9 1:40 p.m. — I almost never take lunch breaks, so I'm giving myself a little bit of extra time today. My coworker and I head to Daiso to look around. I almost buy a bunny-themed yoga mat, but resist the urge. Next, we head to a boba shop that's so ridiculous, it's been featured in those Business Insider videos that are always all over your Facebook newsfeed. We both get colorful boba drinks topped with cotton candy. $6 7 p.m. — After work, I hustle home to get changed into workout clothes and then I head to Barry's Bootcamp. I am obsessed with this place. It's one of the only workout classes where I consistently question if I'm going to make it to the end, and I love feeling like my ass has been kicked. Class today is no exception, and I leave with legs so wobbly, I have trouble using the parking garage's escalator. I used ClassPass for today's class, so it's covered. 8:30 p.m. — Once I'm home, I'm too tired to make anything fancy for dinner, so I heat up a can of black beans and top it with slices of avocado. It's okay, not great. I finish it quickly, take a shower, smoke weed, and then read my book before falling asleep. Daily Total: $15",2,45
"8 a.m. — I make a protein smoothie with Vega One, spinach, and fruit for breakfast. Vega One is crazy expensive, so I try to stock up whenever Whole Foods or Sprouts is having a sale. 11:30 a.m. — The coworker I went to lunch with yesterday brought treats for our weekly Sales and Marketing meeting. Oh man. She made us paleo-vegan raw brownies (YUM) and also brought vegan Smore's Girl Scout cookies. Score! 1 p.m. — Um...so my CEO just gave me a $100 Amazon Gift Card as a thank you gift for working hard. This is very out of the ordinary and a complete surprise. But I'll take it! 2 p.m. — More broccoli and cauliflower casserole. Yay... 5:30 p.m. — Tonight I was supposed to have a meeting for another nonprofit I work with. It's cancelled last minute, though, which means tonight, I'm free! I swing by Sprouts on the way home to pick up gluten-free linguine, pine nuts, and garlic for a pesto pasta recipe I'm making for dinner. I'm seriously craving chocolate, so I grab an Unreal peanut butter cup while I'm in line at checkout. $22 7 p.m. — Dinner is the gluten-free pasta with a spinach-based pesto sauce. I use a Minimalist Baker recipe as a guide, but mostly wing it by adding toasted pine nuts and pomodoro-style cherry tomatoes. Wowwww, it's good. I pack up the other half for lunch tomorrow and totally forget about my peanut butter cup, opting for a few Thin Mints from the freezer instead. 9:30 p.m. — I connect my living room's Roku to an ex-boyfriend's cable info to get MTV (oops) and watch a few episodes of before heading to bed with a book. Daily Total: $22",3,45
"8 a.m. — I worked through last weekend, so I have today and tomorrow off! Yay, long weekends! I take advantage of a rare weekday morning off and go to yoga with my best friend. My roommate actually teaches at a nearby studio, and she hooks us up with a free class. 9:30 a.m. — We shower at the studio and head next door to a new coffee shop with my roommate. One of our friends just went on a date from hell with a guy who pretended to dine-and-dash on their date (WTF?!), so we talk shit about LA's dating climate while sipping on Americanos. $5 10:30 a.m. — I swing by my house and make cinnamon-sugar toast for breakfast. (Two pieces of toast with Follow Your Heart ""butter"" and a sprinkling of raw cane sugar and cinnamon.) I'm heading to my best friend's house for a bit to hang before my spin class later, so I grab workout clothes, too. 1 p.m. — I head to my best friend's house with my Tupperware of pasta from last night. I have keys to her place, too, so I let myself in and find her fully focused on Fallout 4 in the living room. She lives with her husband, and there are like six of us who are there often enough to have our own keys. We joke that their guest bedroom is where we all live. She's been wanting to get me into Fallout 4, so she sets up a profile for me before taking her cats to their vet appointment. By the time she comes home, I'm obsessed with this game, so we play for a few more hours before I have spin. 6:30 p.m. — I get to spin class and it's in one of the areas of WeHo where parking is either nonexistent or a million dollars, but this studio has free parking. THANK GOD. As a child, I never understood why the Free Parking space on a Monopoly board was a big deal. As an adult in L.A., it makes total sense. I walk into the studio and my suspicions were correct! It's a Drag Queen spin class led by a Flywheel instructor and a drag queen in full drag. I'm so excited. We pedal to remixes of Whitney Houston and the entire RuPaul musical anthology, and by the end of class, I'm totally wiped. Flywheel is competitive, so your power and RPM give you points. At the end of the class, I'm in second place for the women's side, which isn't bad considering this is my first Flywheel class ever and second workout of the day! 8 p.m. — I try to resist going to Taco Bell again...but I just can't. I get a veganized Crunch wrap, pinto beans, and a potato taco. It's raining out, so I eat my TB all snuggled up on my couch. $8 Daily Total: $13",4,45
"8:45 a.m. — I'm starting a doctoral program next year and I'm currently deciding between two schools. Today is an admitted student event at one of them, so I head to the campus bright and early. At the parking kiosk where I'm supposed to pick up my parking pass for the day, I accidentally tell the parking attendant that I'm here for the school's admitted student's day. So yeah...today's going well... 9 a.m. — Oh, thank god. They have coffee and bagels at this event. I'm fully booked for a day of class visits, panels, and more, so I'm going to need all the help I can get. 1 p.m. — After a morning full of info, we head to a faculty luncheon. It's been gross and rainy in L.A. for the past few days, but the sun is back! I kind of wish we could stay outside for a bit, but we head into a super nice building where I have a veggie wrap, salad, and fruit. We spend lunch asking our table's faculty member and current student a million questions about the school and the doctoral program. 4 p.m. — I leave the campus and can't stop thinking about ice cream. Traffic on the way home is unbearable, but when I get off the freeway, I swing by the Ralph's near my house and grab two pints of Halo Top's new Dairy-Free ice cream. Why is Halo Top so expensive?! $11 6 p.m. — A bunch of us were supposed to go see a movie tonight, but the group chat is getting crazy and nobody is taking the lead on planning. Eventually, we all give up on movie night and decide to go out in Los Feliz instead. My best friend who did yoga with me yesterday can't come out, but my other best friend is still down! We make plans to meet up at a guy friend's house in a few hours. I order a burger and fries from Veggie Grill for dinner and start spraying a thousand pounds of dry shampoo in my hair so I can avoid taking a shower. $14 9 p.m. — I get to my friend's house and he doesn't have any alcohol. My best friend and I decide to split a bottle of tequila, so we swing by Gelson's and pick up a bottle of Jose Cuervo (bleh), a six-pack of San Pellegrino, and a pack of gum. We go halfsies. $14 11 p.m. — Our group for the night is seven people, so I grab a group and call a Lyft to head to a tiki bar in Los Feliz. $6 11:15 p.m. — Drinks at this bar come in kitschy tiki mugs and I can't resist one. I order for the group so we don't have to wait in line at the bar for too long, and people promptly Venmo me back, which is surprising. My portion of the bill is $13. I had two drinks at my friend's house, and I'm somehow already pretty buzzed, so this is likely going to be my one and only drink. Why am I such a lightweight? $13 1 a.m. — One of my friends gets half of us an Uber back to his place and a freaking Tesla comes to pick us up. This is really dope, I'm not going to lie. We all head back to his place, where I fall asleep in his room. Everybody else hangs out in the living room playing NFL Blitz. Daily Total: $58",5,45
"8 a.m. — Fun fact: I physically cannot sleep in. I wake up in my friend's room and there are a ton of us sleeping in this bed. Why did nobody just go home? I don't want to wake up my best friend, who's next to me, so I head into my friend's living room and pick up his copy of . After a while, everybody wakes up. My guy friend says I can borrow his copy, which is a major score because it's been sitting in my Amazon shopping cart for weeks. 9 a.m. — My best friend and I walk to a vegetarian restaurant down the street and get breakfast sandwiches. I get a kombucha, too. She doesn't have plans until 2 or so, and I'm free all day, so we plan to head back to her place to lay out by the pool. $14 10 a.m. — We get to my friend's house, and she makes me a piece of toast with peanut butter because apparently I kept saying I wanted that last night? How was I so drunk after drinking so little over the course of three hours? I eat my toast while we hike around her neighborhood. She lives in the hills near the Hollywood sign, so the views near her house are insane. 11 a.m. — I get a notification from Postmates that they're waiving delivery fees, so I order a vegan buffalo chicken pizza from a pizzeria nearby before throwing on a bikini and heading to my friend's pool to lay out. $24 12:10 p.m. — PIZZA'S HERE. PIZZA'S HERE. PIZZA'S HERE. My friend and I split the pizza while watching . Like the 90s movie about libraries. Talk about a throwback. 12:30 p.m. — As we're watching the movie, I remember my phone charger is on its last leg. I hop on the Amazon app and order the charger, a vegan cookbook I've been wanting, and a $5 prop I need for a costume party next weekend. It's not until after I've checked out that I remember I have a $100 gift card at home. Dammit. $31 2 p.m. — I get home and put the gift card to use. I hop on Prime Now and order $72 worth of groceries, all covered by the card. I usually would just go to Sprouts or Trader Joe's, but this is free money and if I can save cash on groceries, I'm going to do that. Amazon won't let you use a gift card for tip, so I pay the suggested $7. I get cauliflower, spinach, tomatoes, grape tomatoes, kalamata olives, oatmeal, sweet potatoes, red potatoes, two onions, olive oil, cashews, raisins, peanut butter, a few cartons of almond milk, a six-pack of La Croix, and a few other items. I grocery shop based on meal and snack plans, so this is enough for the meals I've planned this week. $7 4:30 p.m. — My groceries arrive and I toss the sweet potatoes in the oven to make a couscous salad with Israeli couscous, sweet potato, dried cranberries, slivered almonds, and a lime and olive oil dressing. Every time I make this salad, I eat the whole thing in one sitting, but this time I manage to save some for later. I watch a little TV and then head to bed. Daily Total: $76",6,45
"9 a.m. — I forgot I signed myself up for Pop Physique this morning. It is a struggle getting ready and to the studio on time. I pop bread in the oven and make cinnamon-sugar toast to snack on while I get dressed. 9:45 a.m. — Lucky for me, the Pop studio is just down the street, so my slow-moving butt still makes it with minutes to spare. Honestly, my heart's just not in it today, but I used valuable ClassPass credits on this, so I'll be damned if I miss a class. 6 p.m. — I like to use Sundays to cook more labor-intensive meals. Tonight, I'm making a curry that has at least 14 different ingredients. It takes me over an hour, but it's one of my favorites and totally worth it. I pack up most of it to use for lunches throughout the week. 7:40 p.m. — As I was cooking dinner, I got a text from friends asking if I wanted to see a movie at 8:15. I'm always down for movies, as they're free with my MoviePass. I budget a little extra time to swing by a gas station on the way, but I hate feeling like I'm running late, so I just get $15 worth before continuing on my way. $15 8:15 p.m. — I was the first to the theater by a long shot, but we all make it inside in time. Our entire friend group has MoviePass, so we try to get in at the same time to individually buy assigned seats next to one another. 8:20 p.m. — Cannot. Resist. Popcorn. I buy a Kid's Combo from the concession stand and choose Red Vines for my candy. Such a deal. $8 10:45 p.m. — Back home and heading to bed. Tomorrow's my first day back at work in days and the thought of my inbox is terrifying me. I flip through Bumble and Hinge a bit before falling asleep. Daily Total: $23",7,45
"7 a.m. — I've already hit snooze on my alarm a few times, so I have to get up, because living at home means dropping my little sister off at school. I wash my face and change into my gym clothes so I can head straight there after drop off. 9 a.m. — Back from the gym, showered, and ready to work. My company is amazing, and I get to work from home one day a week, so I always pick Tuesdays. I have a few errands to run, so this works out perfectly. 11:30 a.m. — I head to the post office to mail a package to New York. An influencer who I admire is letting me send her a copy of my book, and I'm ecstatic. I want to get it sent off right away ($6.70). On my way home, I stop by Dunkin' Donuts and grab an iced coffee, a breakfast sandwich, and hash browns ($7.50). $14.20 3 p.m. — I haven't been productive at all, which is what happens all too often when I work from home. Luckily I got ahead on my work yesterday, so it's okay I took it slow. I peruse the ASOS website for work-appropriate summer wear, but can't commit to anything. Time to pick up the little sister from school! 5 p.m. — Done working for the day, and decide to eat a snack. I munch on almonds and string cheese while I decide what to cook for dinner. 7 p.m. — Dinnertime! I'm trying to eat out less, so I cook up asparagus and mushrooms with poached eggs. I'm not particularly good at cooking, so I always stick to simple meals! 9 p.m. — Bedtime! I may be 22, but I'm not one to stay up late. I have a strict routine I follow, so that I'm always in bed my 9 p.m. and asleep by 11. I watch this week's episode of (just caught up and I'm in love). 10 p.m. — Time to turn off the tech. I set my alarm for the morning and put my phone away. I try not to look at screens an hour before bed. I've always had bad insomnia, but this slight change has worked wonders. I pull out the book I'm reading, , and read 30 pages. I try to read a book a week, so I have a set number of pages to read each night. Once I finish up, it's lights out before 11!

"7 a.m. — You'd think after months at my job, I'd be able to get up easily, but nope. I've already hit snooze a few times. I take a quick shower, drop the sister off to school, slap on makeup, and I'm out the door. 8 a.m. — Dallas traffic isn't the best, but it gives me time to listen to podcasts. I have a few in rotation, and this week I'm working my way through the first season of from Gimlet Media. I want to host a podcast, so I listen to as many as I can! 12 p.m. — Lunchtime! The morning passes so quickly, I don't even realized how hungry I am. I packed a Greek salad for my lunch, which I made in bulk earlier in the week, but I'm not a huge fan of it. I also just read an article about why I shouldn't eat romaine, so I'm trying to just finish it up. 4 p.m. — Freedom! My work hours are 9 a.m. to 4 p.m., which is truly amazing, and means I get to skip the worst of the traffic. I'm home in 40 minutes rather than the hour-and-a-half it would take if I left at 5! 5 p.m. — Quick Amazon order: two sets of headphones, headphone splitters, and a microphone. My sister and I are starting an indie podcast because we think we're funny (I'm sure no one else will) and because we spend way too much time talking about conspiracy theories. $95 6 p.m. — I spend an hour designing us a very tacky logo that includes the outline of Guy Fieri's hair and race car flames, and thinking of social media handles. We talk through podcast episode ideas, but I start to get hungry, so we put the planning on hold. 7 p.m. — I fry up tofu with broccoli and cauliflower to make a quick stir-fry and call it a day. 9 p.m. — I spent the last two hours playing video games with my little sister. Was anybody else obsessed with as a child, or just me? I introduced her to it, and she's as hooked as I was growing up. We played through a few levels, but now it's both of our bedtimes! 9:30 p.m. — I watch an episode of . I love Mindy Kaling, and the show is funny, plus I love seeing representation for Indian American women like me! 10 p.m. — I set my alarm for tomorrow and put my phone away.

"7 a.m. — I feel like I'm very boring with my same ol' routine, but once again I'm up, taking a quick shower, dropping off the sister, and slapping on makeup. Out the door slightly later than usual, but my office is relaxed, so I'm not worried. 8:15 a.m. — Starting my day off by listening to . I love this podcast, but I have to listen to it in the morning, or else I'll have nightmares. They keep mentioning a book called , so I make a mental note to pick it up over the weekend to read. I love reading true crime books, but I get through them so slowly because they keep me up at night. 11:30 a.m. — I forgot to pack my lunch, but I think it's because I subconsciously didn't want to eat my boring salad. I drive over to a local Thai place and order stir-fried veggies and rice. I feel sluggish when I head back to work. $8.75 2 p.m. — The day is going by so slowly. I once again find myself on ASOS deciding if I should buy a few pieces for my trip to New York in a few weeks. I look through my saved items, but still don't feel ready to take the plunge. I decide to wait until my next paycheck and order two-day delivery so I can still get the clothes in time! 4 p.m. — Time to go home. I listen to another podcast called . This is the one I pay for on Patreon. The hosts are so funny and always make me laugh. Ever since I moved back to Dallas a few months ago, I've been missing the sense of humor my NYC friends have, and this podcast reminds me of them! 6 p.m. — Dinnertime! I poach an egg and cook up asparagus and mushrooms again. 6:30 p.m. — Tomorrow is Friday the 13th, so my sister and I drive down to a tattoo shop to sign up for a $20 tattoo. I decide to get a little pear, since I'm slowly working on covering my arm with plants and fruits! $20 7:30 p.m. — We make a spur of the moment decision to go watch , and I grab tickets for both of us. I'm not one for horror movies, but the reviews on this one are too good to pass up. I walk out thoroughly impressed and teary-eyed! $28 10 p.m. — Home and in bed. I read more of my book, but feel too tired to get through my daily page count, so I fall asleep a little early. Daily Total: $56.75",3,46
"7 a.m. — You guessed it: quick shower, drop off the sister, and put on makeup. I'm out the door by 8! 8 a.m. — I just started listening to a new political podcast. I've been lacking a news outlet that doesn't make me sad, but finally found one that shows both conservative and liberal standpoints without being negative! 8:45 a.m. — Traffic is lighter than usual, so I have time to grab coffee before work. I get a cold brew with coconut milk for myself and a flat white for a coworker! $8 11:30 a.m. — Time to go get my tattoo. The shop is right by my work, so I walk over. It only about five minutes. I slip the artist a $5 tip because I know he is crazy busy. $5 4 p.m. — I leave work, and I'm starving. I blast the new Saba album on my way home and drive with my windows down, enjoying the warm Texas weather. The best thing about living in the South is that my seasonal affective disorder doesn't hang around throughout the spring like it did in New York! 5 p.m. — I'm home! I snack on almonds while I stare at the fridge, trying to decide what to cook. My parents are having a date night, so I'm watching the little sister tonight. 6 p.m. — I make myself a quick stir-fry with all the vegetables I can find in the fridge, and cook up udon noodles for my little sister. 7 p.m. — More with the little sister! We play for two hours until it's time for her to go to bed. 9 p.m. — I start coughing and feeling a little under the weather. I always get sick after getting a tattoo, so I'm not worried, knowing it'll be gone in the morning! I head to bed and read for an hour to catch up on pages from last night, and then fall asleep by 10 p.m. Daily Total: $13",4,46
"8 a.m. — Saturday means sleeping in, but only for an extra hour. I wake up and change into my gym clothes. I make sure to get to the gym early, so it's not too crowded. It's cardio day, so I spend a lot of time on the elliptical and treadmill. 10 a.m. — Get home from the gym and take a shower. I feel a little hungry, but still have to wait two hours to eat. I pull out my laptop and scroll through social media. Then I check on my book's sales to see how it's doing. This month was pretty slow, but I don't mind. I published the book for myself, and wasn't looking to make a profit, since I have a good full-time gig. Then my sister and I spend more time planning out the podcast. 12 p.m. — Time to eat! I make a mushroom-and-feta omelet. It ends up looking very ugly, and I'm sure Jacques Pepin would not approve, but I think it's delicious. 3 p.m. — Every weekend I babysit my little sister until 3 p.m. Once my mom is home, my sister and I head to the mall. I've been wanting to get my ears pierced for some time now, so I head straight to Claire's and get it done. My piercer was incredibly sweet, and I'm excited about all the tacky earrings I can now rock! $31 7 p.m. — My sister and I spend a few hours perusing the mall, and then walk around the area to take outfit pictures of her. She's trying to step up her Instagram game, and since I'm a social media professional, she has forced me to help her out. She does a few outfit changes in the car, and we get a lot of good pictures! 9 p.m. — I may or may not be the lamest 22-year-old on the planet, but I decide to stay in for the night. My best friend is a nurse who works nights, so it's tough for us to get to spend time together. Since I just moved back to Dallas, I don't have many other friends to spend time with, but I don't mind. My sister and I end up binging until midnight. Neither of us had watched it before, and now Shonda has us hooked! 12 a.m. — Bedtime! Daily Total: $31",5,46
"8 a.m. — Gym time! I'm trying to get in the habit of going to the gym three times a week, and I hate it! But I'm stubborn, so I force myself to lift weights and jog a few miles. 10 a.m. — I'm a creature of habit, so every Sunday morning I buy my groceries for the week, as well as a book at Barnes & Noble. (I know, I know, I should shop local, but my suburb doesn't have any good local bookstores.) I look around for a while before deciding on . I'm trying to read and reread classics because I never appreciated them in high school. I've always loved Shakespeare, and it's been a while since I've read this one. $13 12 p.m. — I'm home and starving, especially after my workout. I poach eggs and mash up some avocado, which I eat with sourdough. 2 p.m. — I meal prep for the week: broccoli, mushroom, pepper, and tofu stir-fry with brown rice. 6 p.m. — Time for dinner! I bought pizza dough from Trader Joe's when I did my grocery shopping, so I make a cheese pizza with olives for myself. This was always my go-to lazy dinner in college, and it makes me nostalgic for my crappy Brooklyn apartment that I loved so much. 9 p.m. — You guessed it, I'm in bed! I catch up on . This show is so funny, and it has a openly bisexual character! Everyone needs to watch it! 10 p.m. — Reading time. is a long book, so I'm giving myself two weeks to finish it and am a little more than halfway through. I read for an hour before falling asleep!

"7 a.m. — Happy Monday! My mom is home in the morning, so I don't have to drop the little sister off at school. I take my time getting ready and decide to whip out the hair straightener for the first time in months. I somehow manage to straighten my hair in fifteen minutes, so I slap on makeup before heading out the door. 11 a.m. — Lunchtime! We have a team lunch today, which is paid for by the company. (We do this once a month.) We head to a Tex-Mex place where the food is just alright. My coworkers and I discuss the recent Facebook scandal and the Zuckerberg testimony. I have been off of Facebook for months, but because my job is in social media, I have to keep up with all their policy changes. On my way back to the office, I pick up makeup remover, since I'm out of it. $10 4 p.m. — I clock out for the day. I was incredibly productive, so I don't feel bad about being the first one out of the office, especially since I'm one of the first people in the office every morning. I listen to the new episode of as I drive home. They talk about Coachella, and it makes me feel relieved that I didn't spend thousands of dollars on a music festival that doesn't even seem fun. 6 p.m. — I'm still full from lunch, so I make a small dinner. I heat up stir-fry for dinner. 9 p.m. — In bed, as per usual! I watch the latest episode of , read for a bit, and then it's time to sleep! Daily Total: $10",7,46
"7:30 a.m. — Alarm goes off, and my boyfriend and I snuggle for a few minutes before we get up. I was out of town all weekend with my dad, so it feels good to get a few extra minutes in my own bed. Waking up on Mondays usually sucks, but my dad flew back to Seattle with me before he heads home, and we have a busy schedule today. (I work for my family business.) 8:45 a.m. — Out the door to pick up my dad for our first meeting of the day. He's staying in a hotel in my neighborhood, so we meet at a coffee shop up the street. A latte and half a spinach quiche are waiting for me when I arrive…parents, FTW! We surprisingly don't hit traffic and arrive at our first meeting 15 minutes early, a rare occurrence in my family. 1 p.m. — Our last meeting is a casual lunch and we're relieved because that quiche is not gonna hold us over much longer. We get to the restaurant early, and I pay for parking ($10). We order chips, salsa, guacamole, and margaritas while we wait. When our colleague arrives, we order a second round of drinks, but I switch to vino verde because two margs seems aggressive for a Monday afternoon. I also get the vegetarian enchiladas per the waitress's recommendation and a side of rice and beans for the table. Turns out the enchiladas have peas in them, and while I have nothing against peas, I'm also not convinced they belong in enchiladas? Oh well, they're tasty enough (and free), so no complaints here. Dad pays with his company card. $10 3 p.m. — Before dropping Pops off at his hotel for a nap, we stop by REI. It's the last day of the members' sale, and both my boyfriend and I need travel packs for our upcoming trip to Europe. We enlist an overly enthusiastic employee to help, and settle on Osprey 70L packs with dreams of bringing back Italian wine with the extra room. LOL, who am I kidding? If I'm given 70L to pack in, I'm packing 70L worth of clothes! I'll make the dude pack light. I also have a gift card from my birthday, so the total for both packs is $252.76. I Venmo request my BF for his half. $76.16 4:15 p.m. — Drop off my dad and head to Trader Joe's. Tonight I'm making chili and salad (Dad is coming over for dinner), so I get ingredients, plus produce, chicken breasts, eggs, turkey, naan, whole wheat wraps, Greek yogurt, white cheddar, a small sourdough loaf, and a few bottles of wine ($100, using our joint card). Head next door to pick up a prescription ($10 on my card). $110 4:45 p.m. — Back home, and my poor pup has been home alone all day, so I leash him up for a walk. About halfway through the walk, I realize my boyfriend used the last of the bags this morning and forgot to refill them. I've been the victim of stepping in dog shit three times in the past two months, so I suck it up, walk home for bags, and come back to clean up after the dog. When we get home, I feed him and start making the chili in my Instant Pot (the Christmas gift I didn't ask for but now can't live without). Boyfriend gets home from work, turns on the Mariner's game, and announces he must run out for beer (because sports). When my Dad arrives, he offers to take our dog for another walk to get more steps in. I do not object, and neither does the dog. 7:30 p.m. — Dinnertime! We open a bottle of wine and sit down to eat together. 9:15 p.m. — After watching the M's get their asses handed to them, my dad walks back to his hotel, and my boyfriend and I watch an episode of . Unsurprisingly, my attempts to keep him awake during the last five minutes are futile, but we were prepared for this and did our nightly routines beforehand, so now we head straight to bed.

"6:15 a.m. — Alarm goes off, and I'm super disoriented until I realize I have to be up earlier than usual for a meeting-filled morning. Hit snooze a couple times and finally get up when I hear our trusty Mr. Coffee beep. Give myself a mental fist bump for remembering to set it last night. I jump on the webinar, drink two cups of coffee, and make myself peanut butter banana toast to combat the caffeine jitters. 10.30 a.m. — Check my budgeting app to import new transactions and make a few adjustments. I recently finished a two-month trial and decided to make the small investment to help with my quest for financial stability. It took a little while to adjust, but I'm really starting to notice a shift in the way I think about money and budgeting, and it has become something I actually look forward to doing. Yay adulting! 12:15 p.m. — Hungry again so I heat up my leftover enchilada from yesterday. A little more indulgent than my typical weekday lunch, but hey, at least today I'm drinking water instead of tequila! 12:50 p.m. — Dog is getting antsy for a walk. I look up and realize the sun has come out…you win this round, pupper. 3:05 p.m. — After staring at my computer all day, I'm relieved when I look at the clock and realize it's time to get ready for my Orange Theory class. Change, grab my water bottle and heart rate monitor, and rush out the door. 5:30 p.m. — Back home and showered, I get dinner started while listening to an episode of . Tonight I'm making a blackened chicken chopped salad with apple-cider-vinegar-and-dijon dressing. Part way through I realize I don't have a red onion, and our salad just won't be the same without it. I text the BF to pick up an onion, garlic, and olive oil on his way home from the gym, which he pays for on our joint card ($12). After dinner we watch more . Shit is getting reaaal. Hop into bed around 10 to read , and I'm sad when I finish because I really loved it and will have to wait a whole month to discuss it at book club. At least I finished early for once! $12 Daily Total: $12",2,47
"7:20 a.m. — Hit snooze on my alarm once and then scroll through Instagram before getting up. Get dressed, grab a cup of coffee, and log in for a call, only to find out it's been rescheduled.  Hooray! Take this opportunity to make scrambled eggs with spinach, white cheddar, and hot sauce in a whole wheat tortilla and eat while working on a blog post and watching . 12:30 p.m. — Lunchtime! Heat up last night's chicken to make a leftover chopped salad and toast half a piece of naan with spicy hummus while watching  …so stoked to have the girls back in my life! 2 p.m. — Check availability for Comedy Cellar tickets in New York in two weekends. My Dad, sister, and I are going to visit my other sister, and we're buying these tickets because our dad is funding the majority the trip. I have been completely financially independent since I graduated college (besides Netflix… the horror!), but after my parents' divorce a few years ago, my dad loves getting us together as much as possible and is more than happy to foot the bill since we're all over the country and wouldn't be able to afford it otherwise. We're sure to buy drinks, meals, and stuff like that to show our appreciation. I make a reservation and find out that we don't pay until the show. 3:45 p.m. — The past few hours have been super productive, so I wrap things up and take the dog on a long walk while listening to . Casey and Danielle are so effing funny and this episode's guest is Roxane Gay. I can't help myself from laughing out loud. If you watch Bravo and don't listen to this, you're missing out. They're self-aware and fully embrace the ridiculousness that is It is amazing. 6:15 p.m. — I'm meeting a new friend/colleague for dinner because she's in town for work. She also works for her family business, and we really hit it off when we met earlier this year. After getting ready, I call a Lyft ($10.89) and head to one of my favorite restaurants, Manolin. I arrive early to put our name in and then have a glass of rosé outside by the fire, drizzle be damned! When she arrives, we share a bunch of small plates (plantain chips, sunchoke kale, mussels, black squid rice, and pork belly with squash) over wine and good conversation about our industry. She picks up the tab, and I get us a Lyft back to my neighborhood since she's staying near me ($11.09). Back home, I snuggle on the couch with my boys while watching before bed. $21.98 Daily Total: $21.98",3,47
"8:15 a.m. — My boyfriend works from home some Thursdays, so we lounge for a few extra minutes until he gets up to walk the dog. I make us coffee and spinach egg wraps with berries. Once I get settled into work, I check my budget app and see that my Everlane return has hit my account! I transfer it to my credit card bill. 12:30 p.m. — Head out to meet a friend for lunch – a treat, since we both rarely eat lunch out during the week! I order a spicy braised tofu bowl with broccoli, but they're out of tofu so I sub chicken ($12.92). Run by the dry cleaners on my way home; I usually hand wash my dry clean-only clothes, but there are a few things I'm too scared to ruin. Plus, a button needs to be reattached on my blouse, and all of my mom's attempts to teach me to sew have been unsuccessful. Thanks for trying, Ma! $12.74 2:55 p.m. — Learn that it's National Grilled Cheese Day and briefly consider changing tonight's dinner plans, but decide to do the responsible thing and cook what I meal-planned for. 3:30 p.m. — Orange Theory break! My triceps are still sore from Tuesday, but I won't let anything get in the way of me and my fitness! 5:30 p.m. — Start making lentil and spinach dal while listening to an episode of . We top it with cilantro and Greek yogurt and have naan and hummus on the side. Even though it's not grilled cheese, it's still very satisfying. Listen to another episode with Anna Faris while my boyfriend does the dishes. I love to cook, and his kitchen skills go about as far as bacon and eggs, so this arrangement is ideal for both parties. 7:30 p.m. — BF heads to band practice, and I take full advantage and binge-watch Bravo. When he gets home, we watch TV and then get into bed. I decide to start a new book that was just passed along to me, , but I don't very far before my eyelids start to get heavy.

"8 a.m. — Oof! My body is feelin' yesterday's workout. Lay in bed for half an hour while browsing on my phone and stretching my lower back. 9 a.m. — While I'm making peanut butter banana toast, I look up from the kitchen just in time to see my dog nearly knock my coffee over onto my computer with a pillow in his attempt to create the perfect nap nest. Luckily he doesn't hit it hard enough, so I breathe a huge sigh of relief and tell him he's one lucky pup. That computer is my life. I spend the morning looking for flights for a work trip, and purchase tickets for five people (including myself) on my company card. ($2,000 expensed) 12 p.m. — I call my mom to chat, since we haven't talked in a week or so. She's been having a hard time dealing with my grandma's advanced dementia and just moved her to a new homeopathic assisted living facility, so I want to offer emotional support. While on the phone, I look up banana bread recipes. I've been craving it for weeks and decide that tonight is a good night to make it since my friend is coming over while my boyfriend plays a show. (I've been his dedicated groupie for over five years, so I get a free pass every once in awhile.) 1:45 p.m. — After eating leftover chili, I take the dog for a walk. Thank god I have Danielle and Casey to keep me company again, because this weather is truly miserable – not only rainy, but also super windy and I have to throw my leggings in the dryer when I get home. Ah, springtime in Seattle. 4:30 p.m. — Work is finished, so I tidy up and run to TJ's to pick up snacks for tonight. I get jalapeño artichoke dip, cheese, salami, grapes, two frozen appetizers (their strongest department, IMO), pita chips, a baguette, and dish soap, and then ask an employee to bring me the mushiest bananas they can find from the back. I also taste a couple of wines because Trader Joe's is so fancy now, but decide to be boring and get two of my go-tos. Venmo request my friend for her share. $37.45 5:15 p.m. — Back home. I take a shower and then have a glass of wine while making the banana bread. Boyfriend pops in from work to change and give me a kiss before he heads to the venue to soundcheck and hang with friends before his show. 7 p.m. — My friend arrives and we spend the evening catching up until she leaves at 11:30. I'm surprisingly not tired, so I watch an episode of until the BF gets home bearing late-night cheeseburgers. Be still my heart!

"8:30 a.m. — Because we're both still in bed, doggo knows it's the weekend, and he is ready to go. We lay in bed for 20 minutes brainstorming ways of tricking him into thinking all mornings are weekdays. Alas, today is not that day. My BF gets ready to meet up with his dad and their dog for a playdate. When they get back (nice and wet), I mention that I just used the last of the coffee and our half and half is a bit questionable, so he runs to out to restock these two very necessary staples ($10.85 on joint card). When he returns, we eat spinach scrambles and bacon while watching and meal planning for next week, our Saturday morning tradition. $10.85 10:45 a.m. — BF puts on a record and we dance to Talking Heads while busting out household chores. He cleans the bathroom and takes out the trash/recycling/compost while I dust, vacuum, Swiffer, wash our sheets and towels, and water the plants. We have our system down pat, and my constant tidying and sweeping up dog hair throughout the week makes it go quickly! 12 p.m. — My boyfriend drops me off at Orange Theory so I'm not late. I start feeling nauseous at the very end of class, and realize I must have not taken my medicine with enough food before class. Get home and have a bite of leftover pizza in the fridge and immediately feel better. Pizza cures all. 2 p.m. — Take a long, hot shower, make half a turkey scramble wrap with grapefruit, and watch TV. BF's friends pick him up at 3 for an hour-long drive to see Car Seat Headrest and get dinner before (#mandate), so I do laundry and walk the dog until I have to leave for babysitting. I used to nanny full-time and have remained close to the family, so I pick the boys up from school once a week and babysit here and there. Tonight we order pizza and root beers, and I get a detailed recap of their spring break trip to Disneyland. Then we watch and I get in plenty of snuggles while reading books before bed. 11:45 p.m. — Home and exhausted. After being bombarded with dog howls and kisses, I let him out, do my nightly skincare routine, and read in bed for 20 minutes before passing out in our freshly laundered sheets. Is there anything better? I think not. Daily Total: $10.85",6,47
"8:30 a.m. — Our dog is too smart for us, so we don't even attempt to trick him. BF meets his dad and his dad's dog, and I make coffee. I sneak a small cup even though I shouldn't because I'm doing a sensory deprivation float for the first time today, and they recommend not having caffeine before, but banana bread without coffee would just be a crime. My boyfriend gave me a Groupon for the float, thinking it would be a fun way for me to relax, so even though I'm a little nervous, I'm going to give it a try! 10 a.m. — Run to TJ's for this week's haul: berries, spinach, asparagus, avocados, red onion, baby potatoes, chives, grapefruit, eggs, whole wheat bread, ground turkey, salmon, salsa, guacamole, cheddar cheese, black beans, hummus, laundry detergent, paper towels, body wash, and flowers because it's dreary AF, and I need a lil pick-me-up ($87 on joint card). Somehow I miraculously made it before the Sunday rush and I'm home within a half hour, so I unpack the groceries and make toast with Laughing Cow cheese, radishes, smoked salmon, chives, and Everything But the Bagel seasoning. I eat it with a grapefruit while watching Beyonce's Coachella performance from last night. DEAD. $87 12 p.m. — Float time – wish me luck! 1:30 p.m. — Welllll...hmm. After what I assume is the closest I've ever come to a minor panic attack and almost getting out only 10 minutes in, I survived! It took me awhile to get comfortable, and it was really hard to turn by brain off, but I'm glad I tried it! I'll probably stick to yoga or a massage when I want to relax, though. I throw my wet hair in a top knot, slap on blush and Boy Brow, and walk over to a local coffee shop to meet the boys' mom I babysat last night. They got home too late to catch up for long, so we decided on a coffee date today! I arrive first, so I get tea for her and a cappuccino and croissant for me ($13.34 with tip). We chat for an hour, and she gives me $160 in cash for last night and an IOU for the past month of school pick-ups. $13.34 2:45 p.m. — I stop in a cute little shop on the way back to my car to pick up a birthday card for a friend. Conveniently, there is a gorgeous clothing store next door, and I can't help but go in. I want everything but get nothing, and thank my new budgeting skills for giving me this restraint. $6.57 3:30 p.m. — My boyfriend and I decide to check out a local brewery. We each get a beer (he pays) and play cards until it's time to go to his dad and stepmom's house for Sunday dinner. They host whenever they're in town, and we try to make it at least once or twice a month. Tonight, we have shredded pork tacos and salad, and I drink a pomegranate hard cider. 7:30 p.m. — Stop by TJ's to grab a bottle of wine and popcorn ($11.59). At home, we change into comfies and I put on a Glossier face mask before renting on Amazon ($4.39). About 10 minutes into the movie, I notice a crackling in my ear due to leftover Epsom salt from the float, and it's driving me nuts. I Google ways to get rid of it and grumpily tell my boyfriend we need to go to Bartell to pick up hydrogen peroxide. Run to the store (where I realize I still have my face mask on – LOL), get the goods ($1.99), and on the way home find a contradicting article reporting how dangerous it can be to mix hydrogen peroxide with vinegar. Damn you, Internet! Even though I'm sure it's fine, in a moment of panic I skip the peroxide and mix water with white vinegar that we already had at home, of course. My boyfriend drops a teaspoon into my ear canal, and it actually works! Thank god. Apologize to my boyfriend for momentarily blaming him and his dumb Groupon for my troubles. $17.97 8:45 p.m. — Back to our regularly scheduled programming! I'm loving this movie, but I finish it alone because I somehow end up with a snoozing dog to my left and a snoozing boyfriend to my right. Get ready for bed and read before dozing off.

"5 a.m. — I wake up and quickly get ready. It's a busy time of the month at work, and I'm trying to get to my desk as early as possible. Our eight-month-old sidetracks me by waking up early, but I still manage to leave close to on time. My husband handles daycare drop-off when I'm busy and luckily, my commute is under 10 miles door-to-door, and I'm at the office by 6:15. I grab a free coffee from the work kitchen (they have free soda, coffee, and tea) and drink it with a Fiber One brownie that I keep in my desk. 9 a.m. — I grab a can of Coke Zero Sugar from the kitchen. It's probably too early for soda, but I've already been up for four hours and need the caffeine. 12 p.m. — There's a chili and cornbread cook-off in the office today! I head over with two of my favorite coworkers and sample way too much food. I vote for two members of my team (anonymity fail) and return to my desk with a mini cupcake and a LaCroix for later. 2 p.m. — I go on Amazon and finally order the baby playpen that's been in my cart for over a week now ($65), and formula ($41). I pay with a $100 Amazon gift card that my husband and I got for Christmas. $12.13 3:30 p.m. — Someone calls to let me know that we were accepted into a childcare program starting this fall. It was hard to get into, so I want to hand in our paperwork and registration fee ASAP! I leave for the day to drop off the paperwork, and grab two donuts for my husband on my way out. Someone brought them in from a local donut shop he's been wanting to visit. $250 3:45 p.m. — On my way to pick up the baby, I swing by the food store, which is having a huge sale on baby food! I throw a ton of the organic baby food pouches that my son loves into my basket, -style. I also pick up hot kimchi for a recipe I'm making later this weekend, and white wine to go with the sushi I intend to convince my husband we need for dinner tonight. $33.14 4:15 p.m. — Baby acquired, I call my husband to let him know we're on our way. He worked from home today while our new microwave was installed. I get home, unload the groceries, and pay the installers a tip as they finish. $20 6 p.m. — My husband is more than willing to indulge my sushi craving, so we order an Alaska roll, an eel-avocado roll, a salmon-avocado roll, two tuna-avocado rolls, and a spicy tuna roll. I get our son ready for bed while my husband picks up the food and then we eat with the wine I picked up earlier. The sushi quality is lackluster, and we both agree that even though this place is around the corner, we need to explore better options. $33.14 9 p.m. — Baby is finally asleep. We are exhausted and follow his lead. Daily Total: $348.41",1,48
"6:45 a.m. — It's Saturday, and I somehow wake up before the infant. I should be productive, but instead, I lay in bed next to my snoring husband and scroll through my social media accounts. The baby wakes up around 7:15, and I ask my husband to take him while I heat up the bottle. We have a good routine on weekend mornings of getting the baby changed, dressed, and fed. I get myself ready and make coffee in a travel mug, and then remind my husband about the donuts from yesterday. Sadly, they don't live up to the hype. 8:20 a.m. — I am out the door, coffee in hand, and ready to do our main food shopping for the week. We live close to two grocery stores, and I do most of my shopping at the less expensive one. I buy English muffins, a salad, cauliflower, eggs, an onion, chicken breasts, formula (for which I have $15 worth of coupons), a big bag of potatoes, shredded cheese, soy sauce, mustard, ranch dressing, wine, Kettle Chips, pretzels, and organic veggies for making baby food. I am back home by 9, and my husband unloads the car for me. I play with the baby until I have to run back out. $75.21 10:15 a.m. — I drop off my husband's prescription at CVS and tell them I'll be right back for it, then I drop off and pick up our dry cleaning ($12.44). I also run into the market next door for a few things: chicken wings, organic frozen fruit to make baby food, and a few more baby food pouches ($24.40). I head back to CVS and wander through the store (resisting the urge to impulse buy anything) until my husband's prescription is ready. I pick up his along with a prescription for me ($52.40). $89.24 11 a.m. — Home again! It's super cold and windy by North Carolina standards. My car needs gas, so I bribe my husband to get some for me by telling him to buy whatever fast food he wants while he's out. I play with the baby in his playroom, and my husband comes home with two Big Macs, a cheeseburger, large fries ($8.09), and a full tank of gas in my car ($32.51). $40.60 12 p.m. — My husband goes downstairs to work; he's a tax accountant, and it's that time of year. I play with the baby and do laundry for a few hours before making myself a turkey wrap for lunch. It's nap time for the baby but he refuses to go to sleep, so I bundle him up in his stroller and we go for a walk now that it's a bit warmer. It puts him to sleep! We come home and I run around doing housework and baby food prep while he naps. I also work on my son's baby book, selecting 100 or so pictures taken since Christmas, loading them onto the Shutterfly app, and ordering prints ($12.93). I use the return address labels my husband got from St. Jude's and mail them a small donation since I can never say no to children's charities ($10). $22.93 3:30 p.m. — The baby is up, so we play again upstairs. We stay like this until my husband gets to a stopping point with work at around 5:30. I make cauliflower kimchi fried rice for dinner that hits the spot, and we hang out, drink wine, and relax for the remainder of the night. Daily Total: $227.98",2,48
"7:45 a.m. — We are woken up by a crying baby and go through the same routine as yesterday. I make my husband his weekend usual – two eggs scrambled with cheese, sausage, and toast — and we both drink coffee from our Keurig. I would love it if we could relax all day on this rainy Sunday, but my husband has to work again. I know it'll be hard for him if the baby and I are home all day, so I take the baby out for some shopping. 10:15 a.m. — It's raining so hard that I regret my choice to leave as soon as we get on the highway. We get to the store right as it opens, and I slowly meander, looking for pieces to make the adult side of our extra room/playroom feel more finished. I buy a tray for the ottoman, a mirror, a frame, a mug for my husband, Valentine's Day candy for my son's teachers, and a rug for my entryway — and I manage to get it all out to the car with the stroller in the rain. We drive home, avoiding the highway this time. $102.97 1 p.m. — I immediately decide to return the mirror and frame once I see them in the space. My husband feeds the baby lunch and then we eat: leftover shredded chicken with salsa for my husband and leftover cauliflower rice with sriracha for me. My husband goes back to working and I go upstairs with the baby to play and fold laundry. 4:30 p.m. — I forgot a few things that I need for tonight's Super Bowl appetizers, so I load the baby into the car seat and return to the store, where I buy pickled jalapeños and wine, and impulse-buy chocolate for my husband. The super-sweet manager hands my son a balloon as we're leaving, and he is beyond thrilled. By 5, my husband stops working and we open a bottle of wine while I start making baby food. I like for at least two of my son's three daily meals to be homemade. (They were all homemade until he developed a love of pouches while we were visiting his grandparents.) At 6:30, we turn on the game and I finish up our appetizers: Irish nachos and baked buffalo chicken nuggets. Homemade appetizers and drinks have been our Super Bowl tradition as long as my husband and I have been together. The baby falls asleep just before 8, and we hang out while watching the game. $22.06 Daily Total: $125.03",3,48
"5 a.m. — My alarm goes off and I slowly get out of bed. Husband has an 8 a.m. meeting, so he can't handle the baby in the morning like he normally does. I get myself ready as quickly as possible, drop the baby at daycare, and make it to my desk by 7:10. I quickly scroll through my email and then head to the kitchen to make coffee. Nothing from my desk stash interests me, so I skip breakfast. 9 a.m. — I'm hungry and need a drink. I grab pretzels from my desk and a soda from the kitchen. Around 11:45, I'm back at the kitchen for the bistro box I bought last week. This one is grapes, apple, and Colby-Jack cheese. I get water as well since I've been drinking too much soda lately. 3 p.m. — I pry myself away from my desk and walk to the kitchen. I ponder buying a snack from the market in our office, but nothing sounds appealing. I give up and head back to my desk for more pretzels. 5 p.m. — I rush out to my car and get the baby from daycare. I hate the idea of him being there any longer than he has to be. He falls asleep in the car after barely napping all day, so I let him sleep while I do things around the house. I unload and reload the dishwasher and set up bottles and baby food for daycare tomorrow while munching on Kettle Chips. Then I gently nudge the baby awake and make him oatmeal for dinner with a frozen peach for dessert. Afterwards, it's bath time, play time, a bottle, and sleep. 7:40 p.m. — I heat up the rest of last night's nachos and buffalo chicken nuggets for dinner and put some chicken in the oven while my husband puts the baby to sleep. We eat and watch TV before going to bed around 9:30. Daily Total: $0",4,48
"5 a.m. — I wake up before my 5:30 alarm. Ugh. If I can't sleep, I might as well get ready. I shower, do my hair and makeup, and pour formula into the bottles I left out last night. My husband wakes up and I give him a groggy kiss before leaving. 6:10 — Go to the office kitchen for coffee almost immediately. There's leftover whipped cream from the chili event last week. It sounds good, so I put it on top of my coffee – no regrets. 9 a.m. — I grab a soda from the kitchen and pretzels from my desk. I need to get more creative with snacks! 12:30 p.m. — I'm starving and swamped with work. I run to the kitchen for another soda and the leftover cauliflower fried rice I packed. I've used up the sriracha I usually keep in the work fridge, but at least I have a few packets of low-sodium soy sauce in my desk. 5 p.m. — My afternoon is a blur of finishing up my reporting and urgent requests from my boss (and her boss). I can't believe it when I see that it's 5 p.m.! I run out to pick up my son and am so distracted that I accidentally make a wrong turn and take the long way to pick him up. Traffic is worse than usual, and I'm beyond cranky. 6 p.m. — Finally home! I straighten up the kitchen, load and unload the dishwasher, and get the baby's bottles and food set up for daycare tomorrow while he plays. He eats dinner, we FaceTime the grandparents, and he drinks his last bottle and passes out at 8. As soon as he's asleep, I heat up more buffalo nuggets for myself. My husband gets home as I finish eating and has the rest of the leftovers. Then I head up to bed to watch TV while he continues to work. Daily Total: $0",5,48
"5:40 a.m. — I accidentally oversleep and was planning to be up at 5, so I run around getting ready. Today is definitely a messy bun and jeans day. I love that my office dress code is basically nonexistent. I make a travel mug of coffee and grab the salad that I bought over the weekend. 6:35 a.m. — Make it to my desk only 20 minutes later than I intended to, which isn't terrible given when I woke up. I dive right into work; I have three important meetings with my boss starting at 2 p.m. that I am super nervous about since I feel very unprepared. 11:45 a.m. — Someone is eating fried chicken nearby, which is enough to make me realize I haven't eaten anything yet today. I go to the kitchen to grab a soda and my salad. I bring them back to my desk and inhale them quickly before getting back to work. 4:30 p.m. — My meetings run way over, but they go really well! My boss is happy with my work, and I leave with more responsibility than I went in with. I am feeling great, and I shoot off as many emails as I can until I leave at 5. 5:40 p.m. — Traffic was super light today. I have no idea why, but I'm not complaining! When I get home, I bring in the mail and the baby pen that I ordered off Amazon. Then I do my usual running around the house and make oatmeal for the baby for dinner followed by a treat of whipped cream. He mostly plays with it and maybe gets one bite into his mouth, but it makes him so happy. It also makes him a huge mess, so now it's bath time. After the bath, we play until he is cranky, so I give him his bottle and put him to bed. 8 p.m. — My husband gets home about 20 minutes after the baby falls asleep. I already have a frozen pepperoni pizza in the oven for him. Normally I meal prep for both of us on Sunday, but I got so distracted with Super Bowl appetizers and baby food that I forgot this week. Thank god for frozen food backups! I eat half of what is left of the chicken in a Trader Joe's low carb tortilla with homemade cheese sauce. After dinner and cleaning up, we both head to bed. Daily Total: $0",6,48
"5:30 a.m. — Alarm goes off. I am less busy now, so I don't plan to get in quite as early. I shower, get ready, and head out. My husband should be awake by now but is unwilling to get up when I try to rouse him, so both boys are still sleeping when I leave. As I am heading out, I remember to grab the mirror and frame that I bought at Home Goods. I also grab English muffins and turkey slices for today and tomorrow's lunches. 6:15 a.m. — I use the Starbucks app to order a latte while at a particularly long red light. When I get to Starbucks, it's already waiting for me. I got something I've never tried before on a whim, and I love it – venti blonde latte with nonfat milk and five pumps of sugar-free cinnamon dolce syrup. $5.36 7 a.m. — My boss emails the team to say that she is home with the flu. This makes her the third person on my team to be sick, and I make a mental note to clean my desk with Clorox wipes later. I get an email from Overstock advertising a sale on area rugs, and I still need one for our bonus room. After more than two years in our house, I am determined that 2018 will be the year I finish decorating every room. Going from 730 square feet to 3,500 has meant an awful lot of furniture and décor purchases. I find the perfect well-reviewed navy blue rug on major sale and email it to my husband, who says I should go ahead and buy. I think it's a great deal for a high quality 8' x 10' rug! $198.97 9 a.m. — More pretzels and soda. I am determined to get better snacks after work at Target. I grab a pack of Clorox wipes from the supply closet and then meticulously wipe down my cubicle. I leave the wipes in a communal team space. I'm sure I'm not the only one worried about germs right now. 11:05 a.m. — I am unusually hungry today, though it may have to do with boredom because work has slowed down. Either way, I make lunch early: a toasted English muffin with yellow mustard and turkey. I grab a soda and go back to my desk. 11:45 a.m. — My friend and I head out on our lunch break to make my HomeGoods returns and pick up things from Target. I return the mirror and frame and buy a cute sippy cup for my son (and end up getting $45.17 back on my card). Then I pick up Fiber One cookies, hand soap, toilet paper, napkins, two storage bins, tin foil, and an ""aunt"" Valentine's Day card for my sister-in-law from my son. $60.66 12:40 p.m. — Back at the office and I am still so hungry. I immediately open a pack of the Fiber One cookies that I bought for my snack drawer. They were highly recommended by a friend, but I am less than impressed. 4:45 p.m. — I sneak out a little early so I can stop at the grocery store after picking up my son from daycare. I pick up Larabars, organic chipotle hummus, Halo Top, mini-bagels, a half-gallon of ice cream, pre-cut romaine lettuce, and two Roma tomatoes. The Larabars and ice cream are on sale and my husband loves them. $19.47 5:50 p.m. — When we get home, I unload all my purchases and start my usual weekday routine. I make the baby a scrambled egg for dinner after he refuses to eat oatmeal. He makes a huge mess, so I give him a bath. Then we play in the playroom and FaceTime my parents. 7:20 p.m. — The baby has his bottle and falls asleep just before 8. My husband is running super late. I planned to make a salad for dinner but I am exhausted, so I take my pint of chocolate Halo Top into bed and watch TV until I fall asleep. When my husband finally gets home from work just before midnight, he eats the leftover frozen pizza. Daily Total: $284.46",7,48
"5:10 a.m. — Alarm goes off for my morning lift at the gym, and then I'm back at my apartment by 6:30. I shower quickly before taking my dog to my parents' house, which is five minutes away. I shamelessly use them for doggy daycare on a daily basis. My dog gets to play and nap with our family dog all day, and I don't have to pay for daycare (plus I frequently get free breakfast and/or dinner out of the arrangement). It's a win-win-win situation. I stop at the grocery store after dropping off my dog to get apples, almond and peanut butter, yogurt, cereal, almonds, protein bars, kombucha, and other snacks for work. $14.78 8 a.m. — I'm the first person in my department to arrive at work, so I have more time to sort through my hefty inbox and do a couple of personal things online. I bought two pairs of shoes from Zappos last week to wear to a friend's recent bachelorette party in New Orleans, knowing I'd end up returning one. I print that return slip and then call my primary care doctor to get a prescription for oral steroids. I'm super sensitive to cigarette smoke and NOLA has pervasive wafts of it. I could barely breathe in spin class last night and I started having chest pain. When that happens, my asthma meds aren't enough to open up my lungs, and I have to go on oral steroids for a couple of days. 12 p.m. — I send video clips of myself lifting this morning to my personal trainer and email him the tally of my February lifts. I started working with a personal trainer last April as a way to strengthen my joints. I've had several surgeries through the years after playing soccer competitively in college, and lifting again keeps me from getting re-injured. I feel like the resulting improvements in my confidence, self-esteem, and strength justify the cost. A lot of people design their own lifting programs or do stuff like BBG, but I have very specific needs and limitations and working with a trainer is a much more comfortable fit for me. 3:30 p.m. — Work is very busy today. It seems like all of our salespeople decided to need things as soon as I left last Friday. I sort through my inbox and prioritize projects with my supervisor. Because I don't usually take a lunch break, I can leave early some days (especially every other Tuesday when I go to therapy). I eat an apple and almond butter, yogurt, and a protein bar throughout the day, drinking plenty of water too, and take some Do-si-dos from the front mail room. They're usually one of the first boxes to disappear during Girl Scout cookie season, and they're a nice treat when I want something sweet. I leave work at 5:15 and call my sister on the way to the polling station to vote in the primaries, and I take my dog to the dog park after voting. 7 p.m. — I drop off the dog at my apartment and start a load of laundry before heading back to the grocery store to pick up toilet paper, cat food, sweet potatoes, Lean Pockets, spinach, eggs, and beans ($98.99), as well as my prescriptions. I'm still on my mom's insurance until I can afford my medications – I'm on a lot of very expensive ones to help moderate the more prevalent of my autism manifestations. Today, I pick up my birth control, thyroid medication, anti-anxiety medication, and the oral steroid my doctor called in. (It's a $30 total co-pay that I pay for with my flex spending account card.) I return home, too tired to cook the sweet potatoes I bought, so I heat up a few Lean Pockets and wash them down with Arctic Zero before crawling into bed at 9 to read a little . $98.99 Daily Total: $113.77",1,49
"5:45 a.m. — Dog wakes me up a little early. I get up and go through my morning routine: listen to the audiobook while I brush my teeth (I keep the series on repeat on my phone), wash my face, do my skincare routine, put Tend Skin on my bikini area and legs, put on work clothes, and grab my spin clothes for after work. Then I head to my parents' house at 6:20 to drop off my dog. I start my steroid prescription, and holy shit, after only one dose I can feel my lungs really opening up. Drugs are awesome. I arrive at work at 7:45, and we have a new hire interview at 9 (someone to share some of the conference scheduling and admin burden with me). The candidate is woefully unprepared and inappropriately dressed, so we go with a different candidate, who will start tomorrow. 3:30 p.m. — I finally start looking at receipts from the bachelorette party weekend. So much money on ride-sharing! Mostly solo trips, since I did some excursions by myself and left Bourbon Street earlier than the others. I start a Google Sheet to keep track of what I paid and what I owe. Three of the four girls end up owing me a total of $74.90, so I send the totals out on the group chat and they Venmo me their shares. I owe the other girl $17.18. She doesn't have Venmo, so I write her a check that I'll give her when I see her this weekend for dinner with the bride and her maid of honor (who couldn't make the trip). $17.18 4 p.m. — Our bracket commissioner sends a memo reminding us to pay. I came in dead last, but fortunately, we don't have punishments like in Fantasy Football leagues. I Venmo her $5 for my shameful performance. After a packed day today and yesterday, I take the last hour of the day to clear my Gmail inbox; my Atlas Obscura, Refinery29, Countable, JSTOR Daily, and alumni emails have piled up since last week. I tinker with an inventory spreadsheet while watching Beauty With Mi and Sweet Digs videos on Refinery29. A $104 refund for dresses from Lulus comes through. I bought two in the hopes that I'd be able to wear them on the trip, but one looked cheap and the other was too big in the boob area. $5 5 p.m. — Finish a busy day and head to the spin studio for a 5:30 class. I'm confident I'll be able to go harder today now that my lungs are less compromised. After spin, I check dating apps. I made a new rule for myself that I can't look at dating apps unless it's after a workout. This really keeps my mindless swiping addiction in check and my confidence high. I check my mail on the way back to my apartment and find an invitation to my cousin's baby shower, my Dollar Shave Club shipment, and a reimbursement check for my cat's vet visit a couple of weeks ago. I text my cousin to let her know I'll be at the shower in a few weeks and mobile deposit my reimbursement check ($275.48). I shower and change before going to pick up my dog and have dinner with my mom. 9 p.m. — After dinner, I go home with my dog. I'm a little hyper from the steroids, but I don't want to commit to chores and risk a later bedtime, so I brush my teeth, walk my dog, and read  for 10 minutes or so before falling asleep. Daily Total: $22.18",2,49
"5:45 a.m. — Up early again. My mom is taking our family dog to the vet for a tumor removal and jaw X-rays, so she offers to drop off my dog at daycare (and pay for it) while she's out with the other dog. I swing by the dry cleaner on my way to work to pick up a conference room table tablecloth I dropped off earlier this week. ($13.59 expensed) 7:30 a.m. — I drive to the gas station to put air in a tire. I'm nearly positive there's a nail tear in it that will need to get patched soon. That happens to me all the time, but for now, it's cheaper and easier just to fill it up when it gets low ($1.50). I fill up on gas while I'm at it ($27.25). I get to work super early today, but it's nice because that gives me a little extra time to sort my day and warm up my brain. Our new hire starts today, meaning there is an additional person added to my interaction slate today. Not super happy, but it'll be nice when I don't have to worry about conference stuff anymore. $28.75 11 a.m. — We go out for lunch as a department with our new employee. Someone else pays and expenses it. I'm excited because the new employee is about my age (which is rare for my job) and loves animals. I get a Chinese chicken salad and eat half of it; I don't want to be too weighed down in spin class this evening. 12:30 p.m. — I'm trying to finish up a large project for a client, but I'm already sleepy from lunch. I grab a bottle of GT's Kombucha Lemonade from my grocery store run. The little caffeine boost and bubbles help keep me awake. I remember to plug in my Fitbit Flex 2. (If your activity's not on your activity tracker, did you really even do it?) I also go ahead and cough up the registration fee for my high-school reunion next month. I don't really want to go, but the girl who planned it lives in my apartment complex and really wants me to. I've changed since high school, so maybe everyone else has, too. Plus, the school's paying for the alcohol and ride shares, which is nice. $30 2:30 p.m. — Refill my water bottle. I drink 96 to 120 ounces of water during work, which keeps me hydrated and awake and also lets me get up and walk every couple hours. I register for a free yoga class that one of my favorite spin instructors/buddies is teaching in a couple of weeks. I never do yoga, and it's on a Sunday (I usually don't spend Sundays around humans) but I want to support him! 5 p.m. — Spin time! The instructor is injured, so I'm encouraged to ride the instructor bike in his place. I've been doing spin classes consistently for three years, but I've always been terrified of the instructor bike because being in front of crowds with eyes on me is a personal nightmare. I don't have enough time to think about it and be scared, so I go up there and it is amazing! I have the best time. Who knows, maybe I'll be a teacher someday... 7:45 p.m. — My mom is picking up the dogs from the vet, so I have to wait for her to come home with them before I can leave. I help feed both dogs when they're back but I'm not really hungry, so I decline my parents' invitation to stay for dinner. I go back to my apartment, still grinning from spin this evening. I spread peanut butter on a Kodiak Cake and take my meds. My dog and I are in bed by 9 and asleep by 9:45 after a nice chunk of . Daily Total: $58.75",3,49
"7:30 a.m. — I skip my lift this morning. I don't have March's lifts yet from my trainer, and my body could use the break. I snooze until 5:45, then brush my teeth, take my asthma meds, wash my face, and moisturize. Dog is still asleep at 6:15 when I pull the covers back to wake him up! We pack up and go to my parents' house, and after a nice long walk with my mom and the dog, I swing by Smoothie King on my way to work. I usually reserve JuiceLand and Smoothie King runs for rewards after early-morning lifts, but I'm feeling peckish, so I get a Lean 1 smoothie. $6.50 9:30 a.m. — It's inventory photo day! Taking inventory photos is one of my favorite parts of my job. I get to go play with old records, read them, and photograph them. Today, we don't have anything super interesting but sometimes I get fascinating stuff, like old murders and bizarre legal cases. I show our new hire how to take archival ""before"" photos. By 11:30, I'm back to my desk to tackle quotes. I grab the rest of the kombucha I started yesterday and a Siggi's yogurt I bought last week. I skim a JSTOR Daily interview with Steven Pinker and pop over to Goodreads to add a couple of his books to my ""To Read"" list. I'm always looking for books to add to my list, especially from unfamiliar areas. 1:30 p.m. — My leftover Chinese chicken salad from yesterday has congealed into an unappetizing lump in the to-go container. I toss it and grab the last of my apples from my desk, which I eat with Justin's Honey Almond Butter. I finish up a few quotes and read some articles. The deviation from my morning lift routine, leftover energy from last night's spin, and steroids opening up my lungs have me itching to go for a run after work. At 3, we have a meeting to discuss a massive project for one of our biggest clients. And then at 4, I review a proof I designed for one of our records management systems. 5:15 p.m. — I leave for the day and chat with my sister on the way to my gym, where I go for a quick run. Afterward, I hit the dog park with the dog and then stop by Trader Joe's for tortilla chips to snack on while I cook and clean tonight. I try to spend Fridays recuperating from my weekly responsibilities by cleaning, doing laundry, and cooking. I'm in bed by 9:30 and read before falling asleep. $5.38 Daily Total: $11.88",4,49
"10:45 a.m. — I sleep in a little, then get up, brush my teeth, wash and moisturize my face, and get my workout clothes on. I grab a sleeve of Clif Bloks for carbs and caffeine and take my Saturday walk with the dog and both parents. It's a great way to catch up with both of them. Then it's time for spin. After a great class, I meet my parents, my cousin, and his family for brunch. I decide to run there because my GPS says it's only a mile from my apartment. False — it's a solid two miles. Exhausted, I change shirts at the restaurant and join my family. I order tomato pasta with grilled chicken and my cousin snags the bill before my dad. I don't usually like kids, but my cousin's kids are pretty cool. 5:30 p.m. — I spend a relaxing afternoon at my apartment with the dog. I'm meeting my friends for dinner tonight and decide to go to the restaurant early for a drink. Not only does drinking lessen my social anxiety, but it actually reduces the effects of external stimuli for me, making me less overwhelmed. My friends trickle in, and I put their drinks on my tab. I'm pretty sure I still owe them from NOLA even though we settled up earlier this week. $38.93 9 p.m. — We finish up our dinner. I had a 25% off coupon for our whole party, and the waitress forgets to apply it. I remind her about it and she brings new checks. It's great seeing everyone, even though I just spent the weekend with them. $28 9:30 p.m. — The bride and maid of honor head home, and the other girls and I go across the street to a pub to hang out. I get a PBR to sip while we chat before leaving at 10:30. I contemplate going back out, but by the time I get home to my dog, I don't really feel like it. I crawl into bed by 11:30. $4 Daily Total: $70.93",5,49
"7 a.m. — The alarm hurts this morning. Daylight Saving has started, so instead of seven and a half hours of sleep, I get six and a half. I take my dog for a short walk with my mom. Sometimes I don't take my stimulant medication on Sundays so I can sleep more. It's not great to skip it, but the medication is really expensive and I can make the prescription last longer if I skip odd days. I take a long morning nap and then go for another walk with the dog at 11:30. 12:30 p.m. — My alma mater's men's basketball team is playing in the conference championship today, but I decide to watch at home instead of going to the watch party. I had my fill of socializing last night, so I watch while I clean and vacuum. I do some serious stretching too. The run after spin class yesterday left me more sore than normal. Huzzah, we win! March Madness will be a little more exciting with my alma mater still in the running. After the game, the dog and I go for another walk. Then the dog takes a nap and I settle into my reading chair to finish . I loved the first two books in trilogy, but I'm taking longer than normal to finish this book. It just doesn't grip me as much as the last ones did. 6 p.m. — I boil pasta with tomato sauce and spinach for dinner and then finally finish the book. I cried a little at the end – one of those: ""It had to end this way, but it's still sad"" conclusions. I take the dog for another walk and turn on , do a clay mask, and shower to cheer myself up before bed. I'm in bed by 9:30, but my brain won't settle down, so I read until 9:50 before falling asleep. Daily Total: $0",6,49
"6 a.m. — Up at 6. Losing an hour to Daylight Saving Time is killing me. I know a lot of people like it, but the hour time change and extra light at night are really hard for me. Light is one of my biggest autistic sensitivities. I usually have to bring hats and sunglasses with me all the time since it's bright so late now. Dog and I head to my parents' house at 6:45. I read theSkimm while he and our family dog eat breakfast, and then we go for a morning walk. I stop by the grocery store at 8 for apples, a bottle of kombucha, and cereal. It's going to be a caffeine day today. I get to work a little late, start up my computer, and get water and Earl Grey going. Hopefully, my brain starts working soon. $11.59 12:30 p.m. — I eat a protein bar from my desk, which makes me surprisingly full, and call in more prescription refills that I can pick up after work. By 3:30, I'm hungry again, so I eat one of my apples with honey almond butter as a pre-workout snack. I leave promptly at 5 today. I can't wait for spin at 6:30 when I can get some endorphins. I feel much better after my hard workout, but I don't have the energy to pick up my meds, so I'll do that tomorrow. I shower and go to my parents' house to get my dog and eat a little. We're back home by 8, and I brush my teeth, take my meds, and hop in bed by 8:45. I read for a bit and fall asleep with my dog. Daily Total: $11.59",7,49
"6:45 a.m. — Alarm goes off and I continue to lay in bed, listening to . I remember it's payday and get up, only to be accosted by the heaping mound that is my laundry. Start getting ready, wash my face, brush my teeth, clean my pet's litter pan, feed her, and sit back in bed, still trying to wake up. 7:30 a.m. — I'm so behind today, but I'm purposely taking it slow because my boss is out of the office. I decide to finish filing my taxes and pay my electric bill and one of my credit card bills. (I'm a day late with my payment, so I'll be getting a late fee. So annoying — I need to set a reminder.) French braid my hair, complete a ""no-makeup"" makeup lewk, get dressed, get my laundry ready for drop off, and leave for work. 12 p.m. — Where did the morning go?! My late start really got me in gear for the day. I feel like being late to work motivates me to get shit done more efficiently than when I'm on time. Weird. After packing up six boxes of sample sale clothing (something I've been putting off for weeks), I think I deserve food. Today, I brought leftovers from last night's dinner; a friend and I celebrated National Margarita Day with tacos and tequila. (Sadly, no tequila for lunch.) 5 p.m. — I duck out of work a bit early to make it to my Brazilian wax appointment. I've been pretty consistent with going since I decided this is a beauty/grooming routine worth putting my money into last year, and I love the lady who waxes me. She's very quick, offers little small talk (which I love), and there's minimal discomfort! $57.03 6:30 p.m. — Hop on the train home and head to over to the laundromat to pick up 33 pounds of freshly laundered clothing. I have a laundry machine in my building, but I rarely use it because there's only one machine for all 12 units. My laundromat is only two blocks away, open 24 hours, and usually ends up being cheaper than if I do it at home, plus I don't have to worry about scouring for quarters! $25.20 8 p.m. — Get ready for date night. I'm taking my boyfriend, G., to a comedy show. It's a bit of a surprise date since I didn't tell him what we're doing, so I'm excited and hope he likes it. He comes over and we take an Uber (which he pays for) to the lounge. We each get a beer and a shot and I tell him our plans. He's pumped! I recently made him watch the HBO special with me (which he loved), and when I saw one of the comedians from the special was performing in Brooklyn, I immediately purchased tickets! He gets us another round of beers and shots and we find our seats. 10:30 p.m. — The show was hilarious. Our bellies are full of laughter but empty of food, so we're super tipsy. We pig out on nachos and hot wings and he orders two more beers on his bar tab and I pick up the food tab. A few hours later, we take an Uber to his place and pass out almost immediately. (He pays for the Uber again.) $27.43 Daily Total: $109.66",1,50
"10 a.m. — After a 5 a.m. romp, we wake up and G. makes breakfast: eggs, potatoes, and bacon. We get back in bed after for more cuddle time. 11:45 a.m. — I'm meeting a friend in Jersey today, so I need to get a move on. My boyfriend and I live within six blocks of each other, so I walk home, quickly get dressed, feed my pet, and haul ass to the G train, hoping to make my 1:15 train. 1:11 p.m. — I make it to Penn Station with time to spare. I buy my ticket and walk down to the train. I'm so eager to see my best friend; we haven't seen each other in a few months and definitely need to catch up! We decide to meet in the middle and see together. $28 2:45 p.m. — Make it to the NJ station, but we miss our movie and my friend is stuck in traffic. I don't wanna wait around in the rain, so I hop in a cab to the theater, where she meets me. We're not interested in seeing the 3-D version (mostly because I can't use my MoviePass for 3D and neither of us wants to pay for the extra cost.) We opt for a later showing and hang out on the couches to talk until then. I've missed this level of black-girl girl talk. She knows my heart. $10 3:45 p.m. — We buy movie snacks. I treat myself to curly fries, chicken tenders, and water. $17 7 p.m. — WAKANDA FOREVER. 7:15 p.m. — My friend drives me back to the train station and it dawns on me that I haven't spent more than 30 minutes at home today. I begin to have apartment separation withdrawal, then remember I made plans with friends to have drinks and go to a party later. 10 p.m. — I arrive at my friend's place and she offers me a glass of really good wine. I take a photo of the bottle to purchase later. We jam to music before walking over to another friend's house for the party. 12:50 a.m. — It's been a long day and I really miss my bed. I say my goodbyes, find the nearest bodega for a sandwich and a bag of chips and walk the 15 minutes home listening to . $6 Daily Total: $61",2,50
"10 a.m. — I sleep in for a bit. It's another rainy and cold day in New York – the perfect day to stay in bed and watch Netflix. I braid my hair and binge-watch . 1:40 p.m. — I'm halfway done with my hair, but I have to get ready for therapy. I hop in the shower, get dressed, and throw on a hat to cover the unfinished part in the front. On my way out, I'm happy to see the pet supplies and beauty blenders I ordered have been delivered. Amazon Subscribe & Save is a blessing. Make it to the bus just in time and settle in for the ride, trying to get my thoughts together for today's session. (But mostly I just listen to and play Solitaire.) 3:45 p.m. — After therapy, I realize I haven't eaten yet today, so I stop by Panera to grab a broccoli cheddar soup and bread bowl ($7.28). On my way to the bus, I pop into the beauty supplies store for two extra packs of braiding hair (I'm always nervous I don't have enough) and return home. $12.35 5 p.m. — My roommate texts me to inform me she went to urgent care and has the flu (yikes!). At the same time G., texts to see if I'm coming over for dinner tonight – Mexican takeout and ? Yes, please! I hurriedly finish up my hair. 7:45 p.m. — At G.'s apartment, I order a cheese quesadilla with a side of black beans and he gets a carnitas burrito with a side of chips and salsa. He pays, and we have red wine while watching 10:45 p.m. — G. makes a snide comment about not liking Dobby's last scene, which makes me roll my eyes. Then I remember he didn't grow up reading the books and doesn't fully get the stories behind each character. Blindly watching these movies for the first time in your 30s must give you a different perspective. My inner 11-year-old child scoffs at his critiques of the cinematography and character development. Maybe I'll persuade him to read the books... Daily Total: $12.35",3,50
"6:45 a.m. — My alarm goes off and I jump up to snooze it for another 15 minutes. 7:15 a.m. — Neither of us slept well and G. kept waking me up with his sleep-talking. My roommate texts to see if I can buy her a thermometer. I gotta get a move on, so G. gets me an Uber home. Even though we don't live far from each other, he always offers to call a car when I sleep over before a workday. It's sweet and gives me extra time to wake up. 7:30 a.m. — When I Uber Pool from his place I don't usually end up sharing the ride, but today we make two pickups and there's tons of bus traffic. What's normally a four-minute ride takes 15, so when I get home, I run inside to quickly get ready for work. 9:15 a.m. — I'm having a bad transportation day! Thank you, MTA for the many delays and crowded cars. I settle into my desk, eat my yogurt and berries from home, and grab an English Breakfast tea from the kitchen stash. I text my roommate to let her know I had no luck with the thermometer search. Turns out my neighborhood pharmacy doesn't rise with the nine-to-fivers. 2 p.m. — Where did the day go?! I'm starving. I try to bring my lunch at least four days a week, but since I didn't get the chance to grocery shop this weekend, I venture outside for lunch. I settle on a Santa Fe salad from Fresh & Co. and return to the office to eat at my desk. I'm still pretty new at my job and haven't made any friends yet, so I mostly eat at my desk or alone in the kitchen after the lunch rush. I‘m working with my therapist on branching out and making friends because it really does bum me out not having someone to confide in at work. The problem is I have a lot of social anxiety and feel weird about inserting myself into conversations with coworkers to make friends. $9.53 4:45 p.m. — Feeling peckish, I grab a bag of chips from the vending machine. My roommate says she got a thermometer and that her fever has subsided! $0.75 5:30 p.m. — Head out of work to meet up with G. We're going to a screening at Alamo Drafthouse in Brooklyn. We love watching movies together and it's a free date night since he is on a mailing list for movie screenings! When we get inside the theater, I'm immediately consumed by the smell of someone's hot wings and decide I have to get some. I peek at the menu and decide to order from the specials – I love that they do a themed menu for the big blockbuster films. I order the Waaddii Berbere spiced wings (roasted chicken wings seasoned with berbere spice and a side of nigella seed-garlic yogurt for dipping). They're very good and I'll have to research this incredible spice. After beers, wings, and soft pretzels, which G. pays for ($34.24), I'm pleasantly full. 9 p.m. — The movie was good but pretty triggering. It's a Black Lives Matter-esque film in which a police officer kills an unarmed black man. It's set in Bed-Stuy, which I liked because I could recognize the setting and feel connected to the story. G. is significantly moved by the film and kind of questioning his life. After filling out the survey, we decide to peruse Target for a bit but leave empty-handed. We head to Trader Joe's for groceries and pay separately, but G. buys me flowers. He suggests an Uber to my place and I oblige. (He pays.) In the car, we talk about the film as well as work and personal fulfillment goals. $39.05 10:45 — G. walks home after our long talk about life. I think the movie affected him more than me. I'm feeling pretty bummed/emotionally drained, but I love that we can talk openly about the things that truly affect us. He's a great guy and the most emotionally available man I've ever dated. I decide to take a long shower to mull over my thoughts. I send G. a sweet text of encouragement, do my nightly moisturizing routine, throw on my charcoal sleep mask, and doze off.

I get an email that my federal tax return is being deposited in three-to-five business days, and then check my bank account to find that the funds are already there. HUZZAH! I should probably use the extra cash to pay down a credit card or my student loan this month. 8:45 a.m. — I get orange juice and the egg and bacon brioche sandwich from Pret, which I've been craving, and decide to save my yogurt and berries for tomorrow's breakfast. $7.82 12 p.m. — A tooth has been killing me lately. I had a really unpleasant dentist appointment a few months ago that ended with me leaving the office in tears and still in pain. I've been on the search for a new dentist ever since because I know I have to get one of my wisdom teeth removed. Any female oral surgeons, holla at ya girl. I'm done with these men! 2 p.m. — Another day without bringing my lunch, so I settle for something cheap and filling: a veggie burrito with guac from Dos Toros. I eat at my desk while online browsing for a gift for my friend's upcoming baby shower. $9.76 6 p.m. — Head out of work and off to the gym for the first time in weeks. I had minor outpatient hand surgery recently from an old sports injury and built-up tension in my wrist, and as a result, I haven't been able to exercise or really do anything with my hand or arm. I also had to pause my ClassPass membership. I'm really nervous and excited to get back into the workout groove. I miss Pilates so much. 6:30 p.m. — My attempt to go to the gym is a fail because I got distracted on my way out of work and left my gym bag. Imagine my surprise when I got off the train and entered the gym with no gym bag in tow. Whomp, whomp, whomp. I go home to make dinner and meal prep for the rest of the week. Tonight, I'm eating salmon, risotto, and arugula salad, and I also make pasta for tomorrow's lunch. I snack on veggies with Annie's Goddess dressing and watch on Hulu while prepping my ingredients. This show has me hooked. I'm so intrigued by culty religious things! 10 p.m. — Dinner was delish. I'm trying to challenge myself more in the kitchen and am constantly browsing Martha Stewart recipes, Yummly, and Buzzfeed Tasty videos for ideas. I've really perfected my salmon-making skills. I finish washing dishes, drink a beer, and continue watching until I climb into bed and put on . Daily Total: $17.58",5,50

I briefly glance at hair websites, bookmarking tabs and trying to decide if I should get a wig for the spring. 9:20 a.m. — Another miserable commute filled with signal delays, packed cars, and people complaining. Happy hump-day! I grab my yogurt and berries from the office fridge, pop my lunch in the fridge, and drink English Breakfast tea while reading my emails. 12:30 p.m. — Get an email that one of my favorite singers is performing this Friday! I immediately check out the ticket situation and see they're only $30. I can't pass this up – she always puts on a good show! I purchase two tickets and text G. to see if he wants to go. He's down and offers to pay me back, but we decide he'll just get our food and drinks for the night. $70.96 3 p.m. — Another late lunch. I scarf down the pasta I made last night at my desk while working. 5:15 p.m. — I'm out the door early today for my 6 p.m. brow appointment. I got my eyebrows microbladed last month and am going in for my touch-up. I'm so obsessed with this beauty trend. I did a lot of research for over a year and when I saw a place I've been to before running a special holiday promotion, I jumped on it. Needless to say, I'm really happy with the way they turned out. They look really natural and it's significantly cut down my makeup routine. Most days, I don't put anything on except mascara. 8:30 p.m. — Brow session is complete and I'm over the moon – they're thicker, and the new tool she used makes the faux hair lines looks incredible. I can't stop smiling. The touch-up was included in the cost of my initial appointment, but I'm a big believer in tipping and letting people know how pleased you are with their service, so I tip $30. I take the train home. $30 10:30 p.m. — After much distraction (me staring at my brows in the mirror), I finally sit down to eat leftover salmon, couscous, and arugula salad. The salmon is kind of dry (I reheated it for too long in the oven), but my hunger is satisfied nonetheless. I hop in the shower, carefully wash my face while trying not to get my brows wet, and sext with G. until I fall asleep. Daily Total: $100.96",6,50
"6:45 a.m. — Alarm. . So tired. Sleeping was rough because I had to avoid pillow contact with my brows and I kept waking up to move onto my back. I'm a fetal position kinda gal, usually. I read that Khloé Kardashian sleeps on her back surrounded by pillows as a way to reduce neck wrinkles. Kardashians are ridiculous ... but the tip came from Jennifer Lopez, so I kind of trust it. She's a goddess. 7:30 a.m. — My brows look hella strong today. I decide to add a little color to my face so I don't look as washed out. Blush, a little eyeshadow, mascara, and Fenty Beauty Gloss Bomb. Suddenly I don't look so shocked. Once my eyebrows heal, it'll be less dramatic. 9 a.m. — Finally: a quick and easy commute to work! I make tea and sift through emails while snacking on veggies. 12:15 p.m. — A friend books us tickets to see after work. It's almost sold out and I don't want to risk not getting in by reserving with MoviePass later. I Venmo her for my half. $17.75 6 p.m. — Out of work and off to the gym, this time with my gym bag! My friend and I make plans to get dinner and drinks after our respective workouts, which definitely motivates me to go. My first day back to the gym was met with only a bit of discomfort. After hitting the elliptical for 30 minutes, I finish out with a mixed set of crunches and deep stretching. Feels good to get moving again, but I'll have to work up to getting back into yoga and pilates. 8 p.m. — Meet my friend at a bar in Williamsburg. It's packed, but we're hungry and it's raining outside. We loiter with our drinks until we snag an empty table and finally order food — a veggie burger and fries for me and a chicken sandwich for my friend, plus another round of cocktails. I pick up the tab and my friend Venmos me her portion later. We share a car back home. $34 10 p.m. — Home and pleasantly tipsy, texting G. how much I miss him and can't wait for our date tomorrow. I take a long, hot shower and am finally able to gently wash my eyebrows. I slather grapeseed oil on my face and doze off to sleep, excited for tomorrow. Daily Total: $51.75",7,50
"8 a.m. — Today is Thursday and a payday – the end of a very long month. We get paid early over the holiday season, so although I did a pretty good job of managing my budget, the sight of my new bank balance brings some relief. I start off the morning with an almond milk cappuccino from the deli near my work. I pay extra for almond milk since I'm trying to cut back on the amount of dairy I consume. $2.77 1 p.m. — Some of my monthly expenses are scheduled automatically, but there are a few I prefer to pay manually every month. I use my lunch break (leftovers from home) to pay my municipal bill and also my cleaning lady. I pay her a weekly fee of $19 and she comes for three hours on Wednesday mornings. I usually pay for the whole month in one go. January had five Wednesdays, but she borrowed money from me, so I deduct that and pay her the balance. 7 p.m. — My boss hosts a mini-workshop at the end of our workday and chats with us about ways to achieve the best results for our agency and clients. Afterward, we get dinner and drinks at a nearby brewery. I haven't felt very well this week, so I sip on Diet Coke and eat a few snacks from the platters on the table; the company picks up the bill. I head home at about 9 p.m. and prepare my lunch for work tomorrow. I've been doing this for a few weeks, as I'm trying to take control of my eating habits – plus, the ease on my weekly spending is a definite bonus! Daily Total: $2.77",1,51
"8:15 a.m. — Buy a coffee ($1.50) from the office coffee shop on my way to my desk. Since I've given up my daily lunch order, I'm letting myself have this vice. While I wait for the barista to make my order, I use the banking app on my phone to pay a friend who has organized an Airbnb for our weekend away next month ($60). I have a few weekends away planned over the next two months and am trying to spread the costs as evenly as possible. $61.50 2 p.m. — My colleague treats me to another cappuccino after lunch to celebrate the end of a busy week at work. We work for an acclaimed advertising agency that has a lot of perks, but the industry can be very stressful. There are big budgets and tight deadlines, and our clients have high expectations. 7 p.m. — In my spare time, I volunteer as an emergency responder for a national rescue organization. Our monthly meeting is tonight and I don't have time to go home first. I'm starving but don't want to splurge on fast food, so I pick up a coconut water and a raw cacao muesli snack from a health food store to keep me going for the evening ($6). I also pop into the pharmacy to pick up corn plasters for my feet – a lesson in wearing ill-fitting shoes ($3.77). It's a Friday night, and I wish I were out partying, but after a week of illness and an early morning tomorrow, I take myself home to bed and a movie. $9.77 Daily Total: $71.27",2,51

I've woken up with a raging headache, so my friend buys me a cup of coffee ($1.50) to perk me up. 11:30 a.m. — I leave the beach mid-morning to meet a friend I haven't seen in months. She's invited me to join her at a pottery painting studio, but my head is still pounding and I'm not feeling inspired. I order food and eat a toasted sandwich with fries with a sparkling mineral water while she paints. Eventually, she sends me home — I'm not great company today! $4.60 1:30 p.m. — On my way home to sleep away the afternoon when I get a text reminding me that I have work due to my freelance client. I'd totally forgotten about it, and I'm miserable that I have to do it this afternoon when I'm feeling so rough. So, in typical style, I stop at a garage shop on the way home and buy a stupid amount of sweets and chocolate to comfort myself while I work. Screw the diet. $12 7 p.m. — Done for the day! I worked all afternoon and I'm still feeling ill, but a good friend of mine is about to fly home to New Zealand and this is my last chance to see her and her kids for at least a year. I pop a few painkillers and drag myself to a local kid-friendly steakhouse. We order sirloins with baked potatoes, crispy onions and Diet Cokes while we chat. It's a sad goodbye, but I won't lie – my bed tonight is a very welcome sight. $15.50 Daily Total: $32.10",3,51

We do this most weekends and it's my favorite way to spend the morning. I order an unsweetened iced latte and a slice of banana bread with honey. We're heading down to the beach, so I order a cold juice to go; it's hot outside! $9 3 p.m. — I spend the rest of the morning on the beach, and it's a perfect day. After a few miserable days, I am in my element now, spending hours swimming in the tidal pools. My family is coming over for dinner tonight, so eventually, I drag myself up and go to the grocery store on my way home (parking costs $1). I shop for the week's groceries as well as ingredients I need for the dinner party, so my bill comes in quite a lot higher than normal. Even though I'm saving a lot of money by not ordering lunch during the week, my weekly grocery bill has definitely gone up lately. I buy chicken, lettuce, cucumber, baby tomatoes, sesame seeds, cheese, butter, hummus, Diet Coke, fish cakes, grapes, and plums for the week. For the dinner I'm cooking, I buy meatballs, pasta, fresh basil, my favorite pasta sauce, and zucchini noodles for my mother, who doesn't eat pasta ($70.47). My aunt is bringing dessert, and I plan to make a salad using what I have in the fridge. $71.47 Daily Total: $80.47",4,51
"8:20 a.m.— It's Monday morning, and I get my regular coffee order from the office coffee shop. I find myself staring at the fresh muffins that have just come out the oven, but I resist and eat some leftover fruit salad from last night's family dinner. $1.50 3:30 p.m. — My checkup with the dentist last month revealed two cavities emerging, so I'm back in the chair today to have those filled. Even though I pay for private medical aid every month, my plan only covers hospital visits, so I have to pay out of pocket for this. This amount throws my whole budget off, so I decide to pay for it out my savings account. I usually transfer my freelance income straight into this account and keep it for rainy days. This is definitely one of those days. $18 3:45 p.m. — My dentist's office is above a grocery shop and I pop in there on the way to my car to buy milk, which I forgot to add to my cart yesterday. It's not my usual grocery store, and when I see that they have five-liter bottles of water in stock, I grab two. Our city is in the midst of a serious drought, and we're faced with the very real threat of our taps being switched off in a few months. People have been panic-buying water, and finding five-liter bottles in stock is akin to winning the lottery. On my way out, I pay $1 for parking. $6.50 4:30 p.m. — My mouth is numb on both sides and pretty sore. I pull into the McDonald's drive-through on my way home and treat myself to a small strawberry milkshake for dinner. I drink it while taking a gentle walk along the seawall. $1.43 Daily Total: $27.43",5,51
"7:30 a.m. — I'm at work early today and the office coffee shop isn't open yet. I order an almond milk cappuccino from the deli up the road and cringe at the extra cost of almond milk. $3 7 p.m. — I haven't needed to pull out my debit card all day! I finish up my first gym session after two weeks of being sick and then go to a friend's house for dinner. I stop at a store on my way and pick up a bottle of Diet Coke. (I drink a lot of Diet Coke.) $2.10 11 p.m. — My friend and I spent the evening gossiping about our work colleagues and planning our outfits for our company's 20th-anniversary party, a fancy event we're going to next week. In a moment of panic, I order a designer dress online. I have a wedding later this year, so hopefully I can wear it again! $91.85 Daily Total: $96.95",6,51
"5 a.m. — I rise early for emergency responder gig. I quickly change into my work clothes at our base and stop at a garage shop on the way to the office to get coffee and a croissant. I am ravenous. $3.48 1 p.m. — When I left the house in a rush this morning, I forgot my lunch box in the fridge. I visit our office coffee shop for lunch and fill a bowl from the salad bar with lettuce, roasted zucchini, button mushrooms, roasted peppers, mozzarella crumbs, and grilled chicken. $2.90 7:30 p.m. — My best friend is back in town after being away for almost two months. I've managed to catch her for a drink and a chat in between her trips, but this is the first time in a while that we've had the time for a proper catch-up. We meet at one of our favorite laidback restaurants, which is conveniently just down the road from my house. We order pizza and ciders and spend a few hours chatting about everything and nothing. It's so good to have her back! $17 Daily Total: $23.38",7,51
"7:30 a.m. — Think about stopping for coffee on my drive to work, but after this past weekend, my wallet is feeling a little barren. I booked plane tickets for one trip and an Airbnb stay for another, so I'm a little strapped for cash. Instead, I brew a mug of pour-over coffee and take another cup of cold brew to go for when I get to work. I silently curse myself for forgetting to grab a cheese stick for breakfast (weird, I know). Instead, I eat a spoonful of peanut butter when I get to the office an hour later. 1 p.m. — Resist joining in on the office lunch order and eat my sad (but free!) PB&J at my desk. I also have Greek yogurt, an apple, and more peanut butter. I keep a variety of snacks at my desk since I like to graze. Chocolate covered almonds are a current favorite. 3 p.m. — Hit a slump at work and grab a Diet Coke from the office fridge. Then I spend waaaaay too much money on a shirt I see online and feel I MUST own, immediately. I don't feel too guilty since it was just my birthday and I returned a $400 pair of shoes yesterday. I also just sent a client an invoice for freelance work I did last month, so I'll get a check for $600 in three weeks or so. $292 5:30 p.m. — Leave work and head to the supermarket. I live with my parents, so grocery shopping is kind of a gray area. I always pay for items if I'm the only person eating them, but there are always basics that my parents buy like OJ, eggs, milk, dry goods in our kitchen that I use, too. I'm planning to make Buddha bowls for lunch for the rest of the week, so I buy sweet potatoes, kale, chickpeas, tahini, onions, avocado, and cucumber, as well as ingredients for chia pudding – a breakfast meal prep first for me. I'm planning to make it with almond milk, almond butter, and fresh berries on top. I have everything at home already except the chia seeds, so I buy those and bananas to share with the fam. I also pick up buffalo sauce, rosemary, and Italian sausage per my mom's request, and a bag of pretzels because I think I'm out. $46.77 9 p.m. — Finish meal prepping somewhat successfully, and then go for a quick bike ride. It's been unusually warm for the past week, but it's still a little frigid riding around! I haven't joined a gym since moving back home about six months ago, so I try to go for jogs or bike rides when the temperature allows. I think I'll research yoga and spin studios that I can start going to on my way home from work. Daily Total: $338.77",1,52
"7:15 a.m. — I snooze my alarm three too many times and eventually get up. I started using a silk pillowcase recently, which seems to have eliminated my frizzy hair. (I usually shower at night so I can straighten my air-dried hair in the morning.) This is great because I'm running late today. Instead of turning the flat iron on, I run a brush through my hair, do half my skincare routine (currently loving Sunday Riley Good Genes and StriVectin neck cream), and get dressed. There's leftover coffee in the pot that my mom made earlier this morning. I take a mugful to reheat at work. 8:15 a.m. — I can't wait until I get to work to start caffeinating, so I go to Dunkin' to get a medium iced coffee. I recently learned that both of my parents are pre-diabetic and have been hyper-vigilant about added sugar lately. Instead of my preferred caramel swirl flavor, I order a French vanilla iced coffee (which is sugar-free!) with almond milk. $2.73 12 p.m. — I eat my Buddha bowl but am still hungry, probably because I forgot to bring the chia pudding. I tack on a small order to a coworker's lunch run: three Thai pork and veggie dumplings. I give him $5 in cash and enjoy my second course. $5 5:15 p.m. — This is a really bad day, money-wise. I have a hair appointment right after work, and since I know it's going to last at least two hours, I need a snack so I don't get hangry. I go to Wendy's for my favorite fast food snack from my vegetarian years: a sour cream and chive baked potato and a Diet Coke. $3.21 8 p.m. — Hair is done and it looks pretty good! I've been searching for a new stylist and colorist and found this salon on Groupon. I got a cut, partial foil, and blow dry for $60! I bought it a few weeks ago, so I just tip $25 ... and then I'm talked into buying a pre-blow dry hair product. With my first-time customer 15% discount, it comes to around $14. I book an appointment for 10 weeks from now. Being blonde is expensive! $39 8:30 p.m. — My gas tank is just under half full, so I stop and fill up before I go home. My dad schooled me on the importance of keeping a full tank whenever it's below freezing. Plus, it hurts my credit card a little less to buy half a tank at a time. I use a new Discover card for this purchase that gives me 5% cash back on gas for the first three months. $21.77 Daily Total: $71.71",2,52
"7 a.m. — Same routine as yesterday, but less rushed. I grab the chia pudding and bring an extra-large cup of cold brew with almond milk for my commute, along with my Buddha bowl, a yogurt, and a few clementines. I try to bring my lunch every day because I want to save as much money as possible while I'm living at home. 1 p.m. — Add my order to a coworker's coffee run. It's been a stressful morning, and since I already have money in my Venmo balance, it doesn't feel like I'm spending anything. Now that's a dangerous game. $2.75 6 p.m. — I have a dinner date with a guy I recently started dating. The restaurant has a weeknight special, so our meals come with a bottle of wine. We get a lamb appetizer and order different steaks for our entrées. It's super delicious and I let my date pay. He makes about three times as much money as I do, so I usually pay for our outings one-third of the time. 8 p.m. — I'm not one for weeknight drinking, but we wander to a bar across the street and get a round of beers. It's $12 and I leave a $3 tip. I have to drive home, so I take a few sips of mine, make a mental note to order it again next time since it's delicious, and slide it over to my date. We hang at the bar for another hour, and then I go home. $15 Daily Total: $17.75",3,52
"7:15 a.m. — More snoozing. Going out during the week messes up my whole sleep schedule, even though I was home by midnight last night. There's leftover coffee in the pot downstairs (thank you, Mom!), so I pour a mugful to reheat at work. I grab my food for the day and a canned La Colombe latte I find in the back of the fridge. 2 p.m. — Ah, the daily afternoon slump. I take a mental break from work and scroll through Pinterest and Zara's website. I start to panic because I can't find the jeans I love (mine are starting to look worn out), so I order three pairs that look similar. I hope I can find a substitute. $119.97 6 p.m. — Get home from work and go for a bike ride before dinner. (Is it just me, or does anyone else have to immediately change into athleisure clothing the second they walk in the door at the end of the day?) My mom makes soup with chicken, lentils, and vegetables, so I eat a big bowl with a piece of pita bread. She's the best. 8 p.m. — Set up in front of the TV and crank out some freelance work. I owe an editor a handful of articles and can't send an invoice until I turn them in. Luckily, they're pretty fun to write, and I can't complain about getting work done while watching reruns. I originally started freelancing when I was in between full-time jobs two years ago, and love that it still gives me a creative outlet. In between sentences, I browse Amazon and restock on vitamins. I'm all about prevention, so I take fish oil, collagen, vitamin D, lutein, carotenoid antioxidants, and a multivitamin every day. I have a Prime membership, so I get free two-day shipping. $42.98 Daily Total: $162.95",4,52
"7:15 a.m. — Friday! Unfortunately, the day isn't off to a great start – I can't get my laptop to turn on. I've had this MacBook for over six years and I do all my freelance work on it. It also holds thousands and thousands of photos, so I start to panic. My dad (who is retired) offers to take it to a local tech guy to get a diagnosis. It's always something: Last time this happened, it cost me $300 and a promise to regularly back up my hard drive. Luckily, I can deduct these kinds of expenses when I do my taxes in a few months. 9:15 a.m. — I was too distracted making phone calls on the drive to work this morning (yay, doctor's appointments!) to eat my breakfast in the car, so I eat my chia pudding at my desk with extra peanut butter on top. While I'm eating, I distract myself from my laptop situation by shopping online for a birthday gift for one of my best friends. I pick out a pair of earrings from Nordstrom, add gift wrap, and have them sent directly to her. I'll mail her a birthday card closer to the actual day since Nordstrom shipping is so unpredictable. $29.54 1 p.m. — I cast my last Buddha bowl aside and join the office sushi order. I'm getting bored of buffalo chickpeas and need something new! $12 6 p.m. — Second date night this week! Off to dinner and a movie – , which was my pick. I think he's just being a good sport. We go to a fast-casual burger place, where I get a black-bean veggie burger and we get truffle fries to share, plus two beers. (My date pays.) While we're eating, I buy the movie tickets on my phone in case there's a line. When did movies get so expensive?! At the theater, he buys popcorn for us to share. $29.50 10 p.m. — I have a ridiculous sweet tooth, plus I want to stay out late so I don't feel like a grandma (like I do every weekend). We go to the ice cream place next to the theater and share a hot fudge sundae. He pays and I leave a few dollars in the tip jar. $2 Daily Total: $73.04",5,52
"9:30 a.m. — Nothing better than waking up without an alarm. I wander downstairs, pour myself a cup of my mom's coffee, and chat with my parents. I'm picking up one of my high-school friends for brunch later this morning, so I hop in the shower and get ready. One of the best parts of living in my hometown again is getting to spend time with old friends. 11 a.m. — We go to a vegan café for brunch, where I get a delicious açaí bowl and a turmeric latte. Yum! The total is around $16, and I tip 15%. $19.88 2 p.m. — After I drop off my friend, I pop over to T.J. Maxx. There is absolutely nothing I need here, but I love browsing the home stuff and clearance clothing racks. T.J. Maxx and Marshalls also have weirdly good beauty and skincare products. I buy charcoal toothpaste, two brightening face masks, and a bottle of nail polish. The total comes to $13.96, but I have $8 in store credit and pay the rest in cash. $5.96 3 p.m. — A friend who lives nearby has a birthday coming up, so I pop into a nearby liquor store to see if anything catches my eye. I buy a bottle of sparkling wine that I've heard good things about and is on sale. While I'm driving home, my dad calls me to say that the tech guy thinks he'll be able to recover everything on my hard drive and can double the memory space for less than $200. Not a fun expense, but definitely cheaper than a new computer! $15.99 4 p.m. — Get home and find a check has arrived for another freelance project I did. Yay! I mobile deposit the $250 into my checking account. 4:30 p.m. — I do an arm workout in the basement and then go for a walk with my mom to get fresh air and exercise. Then I meet friends for margaritas; mine is pomegranate and delicious. I always get hungry when I drink, so I convince everyone to get guacamole and nachos. We split the bill four ways, and I leave $25 including tip. $25 Daily Total: $66.83",6,52
"9 a.m. — Wake up very happy that I only had one margarita last night. I go for a short jog and do an arm workout when I get home. After I shower, my mom asks if I want to go to the grocery store with her. 11 a.m. — I decide to do salads again for lunch this week but to mix it up a little, I buy a good-sized piece of steak, blue cheese crumbles, a bunch of rainbow carrots, chopped pecans, and a carton of baby kale. I'll broil the steak and stretch it across five salads for lunch this week. I also buy a pint of Ben & Jerry's frozen yogurt, a bag of granola, Greek yogurt, pears, an avocado, hummus, and pita bread. I pay with my Amex so that I can get 2% cash back. I love how cheap groceries are in the suburbs. $41.55 12:30 p.m. — Stop at my favorite local coffee shop for an iced mocha. I buy one for my mom, too. $7 1:30 p.m. — After I put my groceries away and get the steak marinating (in balsamic vinegar, garlic, and ginger), I eat my last Buddha bowl with a piece of pita bread. My dad offers to grill it since it's nice out and he's grilling burgers for dinner, anyway. How can I say no? 4 p.m. — The Sunday Scaries are setting in, so after knocking out more freelance work, I treat myself to a face mask I heard about from another Money Diarist. I'm $5 away from free shipping at Sephora, so I add a pack of makeup sponges. I cash in on free samples, too! $51 Daily Total: $99.55",7,52
"8:30 a.m. — A few minutes late to the office-wide meeting, which usually runs for two hours. There's no attendance-checking process but rumor has it the senior VP somehow notices if you're absent, so I make sure to attend every time. I spend the meeting answering emails on my phone and chatting with my coworkers over Snapchat message. 11:30 a.m. — One of my coworkers has a meltdown about her workload and I stay out of the way.  I eat my lunch (Greek yogurt, string cheese, a turkey sandwich on sourdough, and an apple) while looking at edits for a paper and Skype messaging another coworker about the mental health toll this job takes on all of us. It's an extremely high-stress environment and we're VERY understaffed, so we're all feeling it. 1 p.m. — Talk to one of my favorite clients on the phone about a big, upcoming project. Shoots like these always take a lot of time to coordinate, so I want to start the process ASAP. His star is rising and I hope he remembers me when that day comes. (I've already told him to hire me as his personal PR gal when he makes it big.) 2:30 p.m. — Someone on another team invites me and the meltdown coworker out for gelato. We don't work with her directly or even that often indirectly, but she invites the two of us out every so often because she knows how crazy things on our team can get, and feels bad for us. I get a cone with two scoops and she generously pays. I make a note to invite her to lunch soon. 5 p.m. — Meltdown coworker, Skype coworker, and I go across the street to a bar for happy hour. I order a glass of red wine and BBQ wings while we bitch about the current state of work and talk about college flings. Right after I pay, a guy carting in boxes accidentally knocks my bag over, which causes my water bottle to spill all over the ground. He apologizes profusely and insists on giving me $10 for ""coffee"" for my troubles. I tell him it's honestly no problem but he puts $10 on the table and leaves. I'm not mad about it! $16 7 p.m. — Home and still a bit hungry, so I heat up half of a leftover sweet potato and roasted chickpeas from last night while reading Money Diaries. I open the water bill and Venmo my half ($18.59) to the landlord. 9:30 p.m. — My boyfriend, James, mentions that he needs new toenail clippers, so I order a pair on Amazon, along with 108 tampons because I only have four left. $18.88 11 p.m. — Answer work emails, including one from a really needy reporter who's emailed five people in my office even though I told her I was handling it. My job requires fielding media requests (reporters wanting doctors who can be quoted for their stories) at all hours of the day. Sigh. Go to bed and pass out. Daily Total: $34.88",1,53
"9:15 a.m. — Roll into the office a bit late since I've worked late or come in early a few times in the past two weeks. Also, I'm currently doing the job of multiple people and kicking ass, so they can deal with me coming in a little late. Get to my office to see an award certificate on my desk for getting great news placements two weeks in a row, along with a little trophy. My team is so extra and I love it. 10 a.m. — Decide to browse Groupon since they have a 25% off sale today. (I honestly only buy Groupons when they're on sale because I'm cheap AF.) I buy two Paint Nite tickets because J. and I should probably get out of the house more often. Facebook showed me an ""On This Day"" photo of us at a Paint Nite about three years ago and we looked like babies. $30 11 a.m. — Finally bite the bullet and make an appointment for a consultation with the scar revision center at the hospital. I don't have any serious problems, but I scar extremely easily and don't love the way my arms and legs look as a result. The woman on the phone says I have to pay a nonrefundable consultation fee and they don't accept my FSA card. Ugh: Beauty truly costs $$. I'll probably still try to submit the receipt and get it reimbursed later. I check the FSA website, which says medical consultations are eligible, so I have hope. $100 12 p.m. — I have a team meeting to talk about new stories we're working on. I text one of my more prominent clients to get the scoop on a fake Facebook account made under his name. Never a dull day at this job, I swear. 12:30 p.m. — Back at my desk eating lunch. I've been eating the same exact one nearly every weekday for the past two years and I'm not ashamed. I've gotten it down to an art and know exactly how much is necessary for each ingredient for a week's worth of sandwiches for me and J. 1:30 p.m. — J. Venmos me for half of the Paint Nite, even though I wanted to pay for it as a date! He also sends $750 to reimburse me for covering his share of rent this month. He owns a condo in our old state and he's remodeling the bathroom before getting a new tenant. I paid all of our rent this month so he could pay the remodeling deposit first. I put the money back into my emergency fund. 3 p.m. — After spending some time preparing press releases for distribution and coaching a coworker on how to respond to an email, I remember that there are Groupons available for a great lunch place (normally $10 for a combo meal) and a smoothie place (usually $5 for a small) by my office. Use the 25% off coupon again! $6.94 5:30 p.m. — We have dinner plans but I'm super hungry, so I cut off the end of a bread loaf and eat it with a slice of cheddar. I also eat a few organic gummies I got in a gift box for Christmas. 7 p.m. — Finally at the restaurant, Stang of Siam, and I'm already in a great mood because we got a prime parking spot right across the street. This West Coast-transplant still doesn't understand the fiasco that is East Coast street parking. Why aren't cities built around cars? The Groupon is good for two glasses of wine, an appetizer, and two entrees. We get two glasses of Malbec (and the pours are GENEROUS), pumpkin curry puffs, pineapple fried rice served in half a pineapple (super 'grammable), and roast duck red curry. The food is delicious and James is pleased because his food is actually spicy. (I did ask the waiter, in Thai, to please make it ""spicy enough for Thai people, not for white people."") I leave the $10 from the bar guy last night as a tip and James throws in $6. $10 9:15 p.m. — We get cozy and settle in to watch the most recent episode of . 11 p.m. — PTFO. Daily Total: $146.94",2,53
"8 a.m. — Wake up feeling incredibly well-rested. Lay in bed with J., scrolling through social media and chatting for an hour. We're driving out to Philly later today to visit a friend who lives there and watch the Super Bowl. We debate whether we should use our gym memberships for the first time this morning before heading out. Ew. 9:30 a.m. — I notice my federal tax refund was deposited into my checking account! I put $500 towards credit card debt and spread the remaining $700 across my various savings accounts. I've already allocated the $111 from my state return to go towards my March ""cash"" budget. (I don't actually pay for anything in cash but I call it that because it's the amount I allocate towards paying my estimated next month's expenses.) 11:45 a.m. — Somehow spend an hour and 45 minutes at the gym, which is truly wild considering this was about the tenth time I've ever stepped foot in a gym IN MY LIFE. Working out isn't actually that bad – it's the thought of working out and leaving the couch that's the most difficult. But who knows — I don't really know what I'm doing so maybe if I were doing it right, the gym part would be difficult, too? We head home to shower and pack for the weekend. 2:30 p.m. — Stop by Wawa to fill the gas tank and grab food on the way to Philly. I'm not super hungry because I ate the leftover pineapple fried rice, but I get a turkey, bacon, and avocado junior hoagie and a small mocha. One does not simply walk into Wawa without getting something. James gets a regular-sized turkey hoagie with approximately 20 toppings on it and a small decaf coffee. I pay for the food and he pays for the gas. This and the rest of what I spend this weekend will come out of my travel budget, which I use for basically any out-of-state trip. $14.81 5 p.m. — Make it to Philly a bit late because James spent literally 30 minutes in the Wawa bathroom and we got stuck in traffic. Our friend is out, so his roommate lets us in. J. takes a nap while I browse the Internet. 7:30 p.m. — After our friend gets back, we decide to walk to Chinatown to try Nan Zhou's Hand Drawn Noodle House. The wait is insane, so we walk down the street until something catches our attention. We walk into a food court of sorts, and while it doesn't have any authentic options, the kitschy fusion food intrigues us. We pick Coreanos, a Mexican-Korean fusion place, where I get double-fried Korean chicken tacos and a can of Coke. Eh, it's okay. $12.97 8:15 p.m. — On the way out, we stop at a rolled ice cream place, where I get the Cookie Spree – cookies-and-cream ice cream, brownies, an Oreo, cream Pocky sticks, and chocolate syrup. $t 9:30 p.m. — We're back at the apartment and decide to get drunk in our pajamas. We convince our friend to start , and he gets totally hooked. I make myself a vodka Sprite and drink it while we watch. Our friend asks us if there will be zombies later in the show, and I do my best not to give any spoilers. 11 p.m. — Slightly drunk but weirdly very motivated to do some adulting, so I research refinancing my student loan. Get a quote from SoFi and figure out I can reduce my interest rate by about a half percent, which will allow me to up my monthly payments by just $50 but pay it all off in five years. I'm making the last payment on my car this month and have been wondering how hard I should go on my student loan versus investing the money. If I stayed with my current loan holder, I'd have to pay $470/month to pay it off in five years, so refinancing will allow me to put just a bit more towards the loan, still save a bulk of my old car payment, and meet my goal of paying it off by the time I'm 30. I'll check other rates when I get home. Daily Total: $34.78",3,53
"9:30 a.m. — Sleep in a bit. Shower and help clean the apartment because it's game day! Fly, Eagles, fly! 10:30 a.m. — We all walk over to Reading Terminal Market and I debate whether to get a roast pork sandwich from DiNic's or crepes from Profi's Creperie. I got John's Roast Pork when we visited last month (and it was DIVINE — 10/10 would recommend) and want to try the famous DiNic's, but I behave because we're going to pig out later tonight. I get a Nutella-banana crepe and James pays for us and our friend. I grab two coffees for the guys and a mocha for me from Old City Coffee. $9.10 11:15 a.m. — Still kinda hungry, so we each get a bagel from Market Bakery. I get an onion bagel with chive cream cheese. J. pays for all of us because of the $5 card minimum. I Venmo him for mine. $3 12 p.m. — We still have six hours to kill before the game, and our friend heads upstairs to play basketball. James has never seen the Rocky Steps, so we walk the mile there in the drizzling rain. We walk up the steps and enjoy the view for a bit. I hold J. and reminisce about the last time I came to this museum nearly a decade ago. I was dating a guy who eventually dumped me for not going to his church and got married less than a year later. Life is wild, y'all. 1:30 p.m. — Back at the apartment. I help clean more and get another rate quote on refinancing my student loan. This place gives me nearly the exact same interest rate, but I would also get $250 to pay off my principal since there's a promotion for AAA members. I make an account and plan to officially apply in a few days. 6:30 p.m. — The game starts and we have an array of apps, alcohol, and pizzas. I eat two pieces of pizza and what feels like a bucket of guac, plus a few Coke and Fireball drinks. James paid for the pizza so we all Venmo him our shares. $5.50 10:30 p.m. — HOLY SHIT the Eagles won! I take a shot and go down into the streets and riot with everyone else. It feels like the entire city's out here. I'm not even a huge football fan, but it's an incredible, once-in-a-lifetime experience to be out here with hardcore Eagles fans. I'll never forget this insanity. James and I bounce when people start smashing the stoplights and throwing glass into the streets. There are people throwing fireworks into the crowd from the skyscrapers and a group marches by with a full stoplight they somehow dismantled. The celebration is now in dangerous territory and we don't want to get hurt. 1 a.m. — Realize we're not going to make it out of the city tonight, so we crash at our friend's place and plan on driving to Baltimore in a few hours once the streets are cleared.

"4:45 a.m. — Wake up to make the two-hour-plus trip back to Baltimore. I feel like shit, and five hours ago somehow feels like a decade ago. I pay for parking since James paid last time we were here. Also, the poor guy is driving. $14 7:15 a.m. — Back at home and take a short nap before heading to work. I feel really bad for our cat, who is exceptionally needy and is yowling nonstop because he missed us. My first meeting isn't until 10, so I plan to make it to the office then. 8:50 a.m. — Wake up, shower, use the Starbucks app to order a mocha, and head to work. I somehow don't feel as awful as I expected to. Just a little cloudy-headed, but not terribly tired. Maybe I'm not as old as I think. 10:30 a.m. — Ask my boss for advice on how to delicately push back on a client who made an outsized promise to a reporter. It takes a lot of coordination to get film crews around campus (we have to alert security, get them parking, and make sure patients aren't around the area we're filming), so the access they want isn't feasible. 12 p.m. — Get a free lunch (turkey bacon sandwich on ciabatta and a Diet Coke) from a conference that I'm presenting at today. My presentation goes off without a hitch, much to my surprise. I thought I'd be useless after last night. The doctor that invited me to present actually yelled at me and made me cry last year (for something that wasn't my fault), so I was a bit nervous to finally meet him in person, but he was incredibly pleasant. 4 p.m. — I think about what life would be like if I started going to the gym regularly and remember that I need sports bras. I buy a three-pack of cheap Fruit of the Loom ones on Amazon Prime. Maybe someday (like when I get abs) I'll be at the level of wearing ONLY a sports bra as a top and can get cuter, more expensive ones. For now, I just need the basics to wear under my raggedy t-shirts. $13.25 5:30 p.m. — Home. Give extra attention to the cat, remove chicken from the freezer to thaw, finish my application for the student loan refinancing and watch a video about contributor applications for a position I'm interested in. I applied last week and am anxious to hear back! I write for a living, but there's only so much room for creativity when you're writing about medical research. In my personal time, I love to write about culture, so this opportunity sounds incredible to me. There's a ton of interest though, so I probably won't hear back for at least a month. I also answer a media request that rolled in from a major outlet. 7:30 p.m. — James is finally home and we sit down to eat crispy parmesan chicken breasts with sautéed garlic zucchini and leftover sweet potatoes together. I'm the primary cook in our house because cooking is relaxing for me and I show my love through cooking (a very Thai value that my mom instilled in me). J. says he'll probably go the gym tonight and I spend the next hour thinking about whether I want to join him. 10 p.m. — I decide to go to the gym after all, and spend an hour on the rowing machine, working out my arms and learning to use that crazy machine that you can move into different positions for different workouts. I still don't know what I'm doing, but I'm proud of myself for at least going and trying new things. I message our old roommate/my BFF, who works as a personal trainer on the side, and he confirms: ""Action over everything."" He says overthinking exercise leads to analysis paralysis. So motivational. 11 p.m. — I spend time organizing my planner for tomorrow (any Plum Paper ladies out there?), and hit the sack. Daily Total: $27.25",5,53
"7:45 a.m. — Wake up and groan. I was in the middle of a good dream before my stupid alarm clock went off. Lay in bed for a few extra minutes before getting up to get ready. James is halfway through his daily 30-minute shower. 11 a.m. — I was supposed to get lunch with coworkers today, but one of them had a conflict so we had to reschedule. I'm slightly annoyed because I could've packed lunch today and now I have to buy lunch twice this week. I grew up in a low-income immigrant household where my mom often told me how short we were on rent and other bills, so now as an adult, I often feel overly guilty or frivolous for spending money. I'm trying to work on it, though, because I know I'm not in the same situation as my parents were and life is meant to be enjoyed. 11:30 a.m. — Trying to complete a media request from a few hours ago and am annoyed because a reporter is trying to get our doctor to comment on a specific real case, which we don't allow. 12 p.m. — Pick up lunch with a coworker; I get a curry chicken wrap and a can of Coke. Back at my desk, I coach the doctor about not commenting on the case and eat the wrap, which is incredible. Now I remember why people buy food all the time. The wrap is too big for one meal, but kind of too small to split into two meals. I reach the halfway point and have to make a decision. I save half for tomorrow. $10 12:30 p.m. — Start downloading a Spotify playlist on my phone so I can listen offline. I've been on the free trial period of Spotify Premium and will have to start paying the fee at the end of the month, but it'll be worth it if I go to the gym regularly and listen to my music. I need music in the background to help me concentrate. This reminds me to browse Amazon for an armband and new headphones for my phone. You can tell I'm really getting into this gym thing. Hopefully, it'll become a lifelong habit instead of a fleeting high for only a few weeks. I'm really going to hold myself accountable, especially now that I've invested money into it. $15.46 2:45 p.m. — Trying to finish up a press release but keep getting distracted by incoming emails from doctors wanting me to look at their research papers and promote their community events. My coworker Skypes me about going across the street for shots. I invite her over to share the bottle of Fireball I keep in my drawer instead. We each take a shot and complain about work – two people quit at the end of last year, and we're starting to feel the pain. 4:30 p.m. — I send an aggressive response to a colleague who always tries to drag me into things via email. (This time, she attached previous emails and added a ""please advise."" Ugh.) I'm unreasonably angry because I always have trouble with this person and spend the next 10 minutes trying to calm down. The email she sent wasn't even that annoying or uncalled for, but my patience is wearing thin from being overworked. 6:15 p.m. — Home and feeling much more zen after calling my mom and grocery shopping. My dad's birthday is coming up and I tell her that I'm going to send $100 on Friday so she and my dad can go out. I have a chronic illness and my parents sacrificed everything for me. I feel like I owe them something. At the store, I got a five-pound bag of apples, lettuce, salad mix, six wheat rolls, two packs of chicken sausages (BOGO!), half a pound of turkey for sandwiches, feta cheese, yogurt, half a gallon of chocolate milk, kielbasa (something I like to keep in the freezer to cook and eat with rice on lazy days), and a new sink strainer. This should last us for lunch and dinners until the end of the week. I request half from James on Venmo. $22.90 7:30 p.m. — J.'s finally home and we eat leftover chicken from last night with wheat rotini and roasted garlic-and-herb Prego sauce. I eat more pasta because I'm extra hungry after my small lunch. 8:30 p.m. — After showering, I spend the next few hours catching up on , organizing my savings and debt repayment spreadsheet, and snuggling with the cat while James reads news articles and creates a Zillow ad for his condo. 10 p.m. — Still kind of hungry, I eat a granola bar from the pantry. Pass out in bed an hour later. Daily Total: $48.36",6,53
"8 a.m. — Up and peek outside to see how bad the ice storm was. I don't see anything except ice on windshields. Get an alert on my phone that certain staff has to go in at regular hours, and I'm included. UGH. 9:30 a.m. — Answer emails, organize my weekly work-in-progress document, and make myself a mocha in the office kitchen. Roll my eyes after I pick up a spam call from a guy who wants to give me a ""free"" cruise to the Bahamas in exchange for me telling my family and friends. 10:30 a.m. — Spent half an hour hiding in a coworker's office to avoid getting dragged into vetting a potential patient story. Other teams always send highly specific stuff to check. My boss told me that it's not my job to assess these while we search for new team members, but no one else on my team is available, and my boss isn't around to back me up if I decline. 11 a.m. — Speak to one of the student loan refinancing companies. They have to verify that I really submitted an application since there's a credit report alert activated right now. I turned it on after I realized someone was fraudulently using my checking card. 12 p.m. — Heat up the leftover wrap and eat it before a BYO lunch meet-and-greet with the presenter for one of our events tonight. The wrap is messy and a bit smelly so I want to enjoy it in its full glory alone in my office. 2:45 p.m. — Drive up to campus to connect one of our doctors with the presenter, who's looking to meet engaging doctors for opportunities to work as consultants with Hollywood producers. 4 p.m. — The meeting goes really well! I knew he'd be a great fit. 5 p.m. — The event ends and I sneak two slices of pizza while chatting with my teammates. I get a slice of pepperoni and a slice of cheese and they're mediocre, but hey, free food! 6 p.m. — Home after the event and upload my latest student loan billing document to the refinancing company for review. I also work on submitting my writing for an award. Applications just opened today! I select my best pieces from 2017, create cover sheets for all of them, and merge them all into one PDF before submitting. 7:45 p.m. — James is finally home and he seems super stressed. He's been working late the past few days and is trying to oversee the remodeling from 3,000 miles away, find new tenants, and prepare his taxes all at once. I don't envy him. He pours himself a bowl of cereal (this is why I'm the primary cook; we'd be eating cereal every night otherwise) and calls the contractor to talk about the remodeling while I chat with Amazon Prime about why my sports bras weren't delivered today. 9:30 p.m. — Our plan was to go to the gym but J. takes a ton of time to use the bathroom. By the time he gets out, I'm already in bed wrapped up in a Sherpa blanket. He joins and so does our cat. We're definitely not going to the gym now. Daily Total: $0",7,53
"7:30 a.m. — Ugh, Mondays. I wake up, heat up a cup of cold brew that my husband dripped the night before, add about half a cup of organic grass-fed whole milk, and then do a three-minute meditation on Headspace and a five-minute yoga flow on YouTube. Afterwards, I put my husband's lunch on the counter so he doesn't forget to take it, make myself a second coffee (this time with coconut/almond milk) in my favorite Hydro Flask thermos, and throw my own in my lunch box. I take a quick shower and drive to work. 11 a.m. — I work with my direct report to get a bunch of deliverables out this morning, and then take a quick break for breakfast. It takes me a while to get hungry in the morning, probably because of the quantity of milk that I drink with my coffee (literally half coffee, half milk). I eat a sliced apple with a bunch of peanut butter, which I manage to get all over my pants. I run to the bathroom and use a wet paper towel to wash it off. 2 p.m. — I heat up a little container of roasted veggies and chicken breast and read while I eat. There's no place to buy food within walking distance of my office, but I save a lot of money and eat a lot healthier because I always bring my food, so I don't care much. 5 p.m. — I get home, change quickly into running clothes, and walk to my community's gym, which is free and really nice. I sprint on the treadmill as fast as I can for a mile and then walk back to my apartment. I recently got to the point where I can run a mile in under eight minutes, which means my workouts are really short. Occasionally I run a mile and a half or even two, but I get so bored running that if I'm not feeling tired by the home stretch, I just crank up the speed so that I work up enough of a sweat to justify jumping off after a mile. Head back to my apartment and do another quick yoga flow to stretch. 8:30 p.m. — Dinnertime. I meal plan each week and buy groceries ahead of time. Tonight I poach fresh wild cod I bought at Whole Foods on Sunday with white wine, chicken broth, a bay leaf, and squeeze of lemon. I also sauté wild mushrooms and broccolini and cook farro in chicken broth. My husband gets home at 8:30 and we eat right away because I'm starving. Then I defrost soup for our lunches tomorrow and slice apples so we have snacks. 9:30 p.m. — My husband and I currently sleep on a mattress on the floor – mostly because we don't want to waste money on cheap furniture and aren't ready to buy anything as expensive as what we ultimately want. We're hoping to start a family at some point next year and will need to move to a bigger apartment, so I figure that might be a good time to buy furniture. A quick look at the website of our favorite furniture store, Room & Board, shows me that this is likely to be a significant financial investment on our part. My husband is a minimalist and would happily live in an empty apartment, so I like to give him plenty of notice when I start thinking about these expensive purchases. I fire the opening salvo by telling him it will probably be hard to get off a mattress on the floor when I'm eight months pregnant, so if he wants a baby we'll have to buy a bed. He smiles and tells me that's why I do yoga. I laugh, and we head off to our sad mattress on the floor. Daily Total: $0",1,54
"7:30 a.m. — Coffee, meditation, yoga flow. I purchased my Headspace subscription in January and so far I love it. I'm not sure if I'll do it again next year because I got this one for 40% off, but so far it's the only thing that has been able to help me meditate on a regular basis (even if it's only three to five minutes a day). We have a small one-bedroom apartment, but because my husband doesn't get up until 8:30 most days, I have the living room and kitchen to myself almost every morning. I take my coffee and lunch to go. Before I leave, I grab a cookie I made a few weeks ago out of the freezer and slip it into my husband's lunch with a little love note. 1 p.m. — I was in back-to-back meetings all morning and I'm starving. My director swings by my cube while I'm shoveling an extra large slice of Honeycrisp apple in my mouth, takes one look at me, and says he'll come back later. He knows I can be difficult when I'm hungry, and he knows I didn't get to eat breakfast this morning. I promise him I'll come find him as soon as I've eaten. When I walk into his office a few minutes later, he hands me a cookie just in case I'm still hungry. Since I try not to eat refined sugar (with the exception of really good desserts) or preservatives, I don't accept, but thank him for thinking of me. We quickly review a contract I wrote up for a program I'm expanding out; he recommends a few changes but is happy with the document overall. 4:30 p.m. — I didn't get to eat my lunch today since I was running around to offsite meetings all afternoon, so when I get home I'm too tired to exercise. I eat two slices of fresh bread (from a Bay Area bakery called Acme) slathered with butter while I read Money Diaries. Delicious. Afterward, I'm still hungry, so I have a cara cara orange and a bunch of brie and crackers, and then do laundry and make dinner while I watch a dinosaur documentary on CuriosityStream. 8 p.m. — My husband comes home from work and we eat dinner. I made a salad with lettuce, radicchio, endive, fennel, radish, scallions, tomato, avocado, black beans, frozen corn, shredded cheddar cheese, and chicken breast, slathered in Cindy's ranch. Ranch is my weakness. We watch (I just discovered this show and am OBSESSED) while eating a few squares of Trader Joe's 72% cacao dark chocolate. I honestly hate it, but it mutes my chocolate and sugar cravings effectively. We buy big packages of it because my husband insists on buying everything in its most cost-effective quantity, but I think the big bars oxidize by the end and the last part tastes far worse than the first. 10 p.m. — I'm out of deodorant and couldn't find a non-antiperspirant at Target last week. I decide to try a new natural brand from Amazon, Primal Pit Paste. It's a little bit expensive, but I order it anyway. Since it's Prime, it will come in two days. We head to bed around 11. $10.95 Daily Total: $10.95",2,54
"7:30 a.m. — Coffee, meditation, yoga, lunches to go. Crisis! I can't find my favorite (and only) coffee thermos. Contemplate taking my husband's, but decide that's a mean trick to play. I hope I left mine at the office. I rarely lose things, so this is odd. I use another thermos we have in the cabinet but I don't like it. 11 a.m. — Thermos is nowhere to be found. It might turn up somewhere, but I'm not taking any chances, so I hop on Amazon and order a new one in the same color ($21.45). I see that the green is only $16.50, so I add that to the cart as well and buy both. I've been meaning to buy a backup, and this seems like a good opportunity. Both ship via Prime, and will arrive by tomorrow! $41.12 2 p.m. — I'm absolutely starving, but my day has been a blur of meetings, and the next is offsite. I eat a half a baked sweet potato in my car with hands at a red light. It's not ideal, but better than being hungry. 5 p.m. — I get home and race to the gym for my one-mile sprint. I buy a new song on iTunes on my way to the gym. I buy four to six songs a month on iTunes because I can't run without new music and a good running beat. I have extra energy and the new song is good, so I make it a mile and a half. Later, I take a long shower, wash my hair, and do a face mask while I make dinner. One of my best friends calls, so we chat on the phone while I cook. As always, I also lay out my outfit for the following morning. I don't like to wake up my husband, so I leave my clothes in the living room the night before so all I need to do in the morning is slip out of the bedroom and shut the door behind me. $1.29 8:30 p.m. — Tonight we have lentils that I cooked with onions and a chopped potato on top of wilted fresh spinach. I also slice half an avocado into each bowl and put soft-boiled eggs on top. I grate copious amounts of parmesan over the whole thing. As usual, I package some up for our lunches tomorrow simultaneously. As soon as my husband walks in, we eat. I'm starving. After dinner, we split a grapefruit for ""dessert."" It doesn't really count as dessert as far as I'm concerned, but it is delicious. 10 p.m. — My husband watches a car show called while I obsessively plan our next Europe trip. We're headed to the UK, and I've already booked our hotel. We'll be staying at The Waldorf Astoria, and although I have mixed feelings about not staying in a cute boutique hotel, I'm hoping we'll have enough Hilton points to stay in Hawaii for free next year because of it. I've created a list of the museums and landmarks we want to see in London, and I Google Map all of the locations so I can plan the best itinerary. We'll have to walk about five miles a day for the first two days and nine on the third day. I make a note that we should Uber between a few of the legs so we don't tire ourselves out. (We did a 10-mile walk one day in Paris when we were there recently and got way too exhausted.) We head to bed around 11:30. Daily Total: $42.41",3,54
"7:30 a.m. — Coffee, meditation, yoga. I have a call with our East Coast design team to go over deliverables they've been working on and decide to do it from home. I text my direct report to let her know that I'll be in late this morning and give her a few tasks. 11 a.m. — I have my usual apple/peanut butter snack, and then run by my director's office. I requested a pretty substantial raise a few months ago, and my director agreed but needed to get approval from our executive director first. I used to intensely dislike negotiating, but I've worked hard to get better at it and now I don't find it quite so distasteful. I ask my director whether or not our ED will approve the raise, and he tells me it's looking good but that he's waiting for final confirmation. 2 p.m. — I drive to an offsite meeting a little early and eat my leftovers in the car. I browse the Nordstrom website while I'm in the car and find some things I want, but think about our upcoming trip and decide I need to save the money more than I need the clothes. Because we want to start a family next year, my goal is to have $25,000 in my slush savings account by the time a baby is born. Between traveling and bedroom furniture, I'm going to need to save very effectively between now and then if I want to accomplish this. My husband and I never worked out a formal financial agreement, but our spending habits are fairly similar, so we haven't argued over finances yet. This is, in part, because we save separately, so if we disagree over something the other wants to buy, we use our personal slush savings to buy the item. So I want to make sure I always have enough money to buy myself anything I want, even if we disagree. 4 p.m. — I stop by my salon to get my monthly lash fill ($75). It takes about 90 minutes to glue all the individual lashes on, and I find lying there impossibly boring. But my eyes look so fabulous that I literally only have to wear a little bronzer and blush for the rest of the month, so it's worth every cent. My other regular health and beauty expenses include a one-hour massage per month, and I'm finishing up my last round of laser hair removal (which has cost me about $2,000 for bikini and underarms in total). The lashes and massage I put on our joint card, but the laser hair removal I pay for out of my slush savings. 5:30 p.m. — I can't get my lashes wet for four hours, so I do a quick yoga flow at home instead of a run so I don't get too sweaty. I rinse the day off in the shower after my mini workout and start on dinner. Tonight we're having roasted cauliflower tossed in olive oil, garlic, lemon, and parsley, roasted red potatoes with garlic and olive oil, grilled asparagus, and grilled flatiron steak. I put the steak on the counter and drizzle it with olive oil, garlic, and salt, and then my husband and I head down to the communal courtyard to grill the steak and asparagus when he gets home. We'll take the leftovers for lunch tomorrow. We also make bubble water with our Soda Stream and squeeze a lime in it. Our local water tastes so mineral-y that I can't drink it plain, so we bought a Soda Stream and go through at least 14 limes a week between the two of us. I'm not sure if that much carbonated water is good for me, but at least I won't be getting scurvy anytime soon. 9 p.m. — We watch Netflix on the sofa and I meal plan for next week while eating a cara cara orange. I follow NYT Cooking on Instagram and usually save at least one featured recipe to try. We head to bed around 11. Daily Total: $0",4,54
"7 a.m. — I'm up a little early today because I'm launching a new program segment and I'm running the pilot at my office today. I do my usual morning routine and race out the door. When I get to work, I see that my project manager has set everything up perfectly. I'm lucky to have her on my team. 11 a.m. — I give my project manager my credit card number to order pizza for the program launch, but the bank flags the purchase and blocks the card. I call in to straighten everything out, and eventually, the pizza arrives. I'm starving, so I scarf down a piece and toss the crust. (I don't like crust enough to justify eating the extra white carbs. I try to save sugars and non-whole grain carbs for things that I really, really like, and pizza crust doesn't make the cut.) I'll submit this purchase to my monthly expense report. I had to travel two weeks for work this month, so my expense report will be really high. My husband and I have a travel card that gives us extra points for travel-related expenses, so I'm always happy to use my own card instead of a corporate card. ($175.74 expensed) 1:30 p.m. — Program launch goes off without a hitch, although my presentation could have been better (I'm still working on my public speaking skills). Regardless, I sign up an additional group for the program, meaning this year I've brought in enough business to cover myself and my direct report at our fully burdened rate to the organization we work for. 3 p.m. — I head to the grocery store and buy food for next week: one gallon of organic grass-fed whole milk from a local creamery, one bottle of toasted coconut almond milk, organic butter, olive oil, cheddar cheese, goat cheese, free-range eggs, whole milk Greek yogurt, steel cut oats, and bulk whole wheat flour. $61.96 3:30 p.m. — I head to a farm stand with really cheap local produce. I buy lettuce, endive, radicchio, fennel, spinach, zucchini, beets, tomato, cucumber, peppers, cara cara oranges, avocados, limes, lemons, and grapefruit. $31.25 6:30 p.m. — Tonight I defrost a ball of pizza dough from Whole Foods and let it rise while I work out. When I get back I stretch it out, sprinkle cornmeal on a cookie sheet (someday I'd like a real pizza stone, but for now a cookie sheet works just fine), and add plain tomato sauce I warmed with olive oil and garlic. I top it with shredded whole milk mozzarella, thinly sliced mushrooms, peppers, onions, and black olives. I also make a salad with lettuce, endive, radicchio, shredded carrot, tomato, cucumber, avocado, scallion, tomato, and balsamic dressing. When my husband gets home, we bake the pizza and eat while watching a movie. Then it's a grapefruit for dessert again. 9 p.m. — I have a coupon for a box of pears, so I send them to a friend who has been going through a tough time. Fresh fruit in the middle of winter on the East Coast is always nice. We head to bed around 11. $31.54 Daily Total: $124.75",5,54
"7:30 a.m. — I'm up at my usual time and go for a quick run, yoga flow, shower, and meditation. 9:30 a.m. — When my husband wakes up, we stop by the farmer's market to pick up a fresh loaf of bread, two bunches of carrots, and a carton of fresh but out-of-season (so, not terribly delicious) strawberries. $15.25 10 a.m. — We go to the butcher, something we do every three weeks. We buy four full chicken breasts (we eat one or two a week), a pound of chicken thighs, a flatiron steak, a pound of ground turkey, a half pound of bacon, sliced turkey, and smoked gouda. The meat isn't very cheap here, but the quality is excellent. When we get home, my husband carefully cuts all the tendon attachments off the chicken breasts and freezes them in individual bags. $87.57 11:30 a.m. — My husband makes us scrambled eggs, bacon, fresh avocado toast, strawberries, and grapefruit. I wash and prep all the veggies I bought yesterday and make us a bunch of sautéed spinach to go with our brunch. 3 p.m. — We spend the afternoon watching '80s action movies and I research London restaurants. We have five nights in London, and we want to eat a different Michelin star restaurant each night. I carefully look at each menu, scroll through Google photos of the restaurants, read independent reviews, and Google Map the distances from our hotel. I try to get my husband interested in the details, but he just says ""yes"" to everything. Some of the restaurants I can already make reservations at; others won't accept them until 90 days out. I mark my calendar to remind myself to make them as soon as I'm able. I also research coffee spots for the mornings and pick a few good bakeries for lunches. 5 p.m. — My husband peels a few oranges and creates a smorgasbord of cheese and crackers for a snack. I continue my London planning. It seems a bit obsessive, but I find that we're far more able to take advantage of the places we visit due to my planning. I try not to lock us into anything except dinner reservations (usually after 8 p.m.) so that if we find something more interesting than what I've planned for us when we get there we can easily do that instead. But through my research, I learn the geography of the places we visit and have a better framework to understand any new options I discover once we're there. 8 p.m. — I defrost white bean and farro soup for dinner, and make us avocado toast to go with it. We rent a movie on iTunes and head to bed around 11. $5.99 Daily Total: $108.81",6,54
"7:30 a.m. — Coffee, yoga, meditation. I read a new book on the sofa until my husband wakes up and makes us pancakes for breakfast. He usually makes a double recipe and eats a leftover pancake for breakfast every morning. We're creatures of habit. 11 a.m. — We head out for an easy three-mile hike; the weather is beautiful, but as usual in the Bay, its pretty crowded. We're both from the East Coast and miss the seasons, and we hope to move back within the next three to five years. In our area, any house that's big enough for a family, nice enough that we'd want to live there, and with a 20-minute commute in each direction will cost us $1.5 to $2 million. The down payment we'd need to make to bring our mortgage payments into the realm of feasibility would be almost all of our savings, so we'd rather move back east. 3 p.m. — I take a shower, do a face mask, fold laundry, prep lunches for tomorrow, and set out my clothes. 6:30 p.m. — We head to a nearby restaurant with some of our couple friends. The restaurant serves small plates for sharing, so we order as a group and split everything. We each start with a drink and then share a really wide variety of food; it's all amazing. We end with two desserts: a chocolate lava cake (that I could have eaten by myself), and an olive oil strawberry shortcake that I passed on after a bite. Next time we'll order two chocolate cakes. $80.46 9 p.m. — We stream Netflix and relax for the rest of the night. Daily Total: $80.46",7,54
"7 a.m. — My alarm goes off and I go downstairs to eat breakfast in my PJs, a new weekday habit I plan to keep up for a while. I eat oatmeal every day and today it's overnight oats with chia and flaxseeds, kefir, banana, and maca powder. I studied abroad in Peru and began eating maca there. It's growing trendiness — and price — in the U.S. annoy me, but I love the taste and energy-boosting properties. I also drink half a mug of black coffee. 8:30 a.m. — Arrive at work after an easy, 25-minute commute. For some reason, the roads are abandoned on Fridays. It makes me sad to think everyone else is working from home but at least my drive is more enjoyable. Make myself a cup of coffee from our Keurig knock-off machine (which is actually pretty good and settle in to check my email. 10 a.m. — Weekly supervision with my boss. We discuss the latest updates with my caseload and she helps me troubleshoot issues. My work mainly consists of helping people apply for SNAP (food stamps), maximizing their SNAP benefit, and working with the government when they mess up people's cases (which is often). It's an ideal first job in the anti-hunger field. I snack on peanuts and a Cara Cara orange . 1:30 p.m. — Take a lunch break with a colleague (and only work friend) after helping her translate a client call into Spanish. Most of my colleagues are middle-aged women, which is lovely, but it's nice to have someone my own age around. I reheat miso soup that I made last night. It is fantastic and filled with yummy things: sweet potato, zucchini, seaweed, rice noodles, salmon, and a soft-boiled egg. I tell my friend about the college sophomore I made out with last weekend at a concert. 5 p.m. — Arrive home after leaving work at 4:30 p.m. and leave for the gym. Majorly wipe out on the ice with my first step out the door. Once I get to the gym, I try running on the treadmill and give up after half a mile. My ankle is off and my knee hurts from my fall. I look down and already have a big bruise. Get on the bike instead and jam out to reggaeton. 7:15 p.m. — Walk home from the gym and throw together leftover tofu and eggplant with sliced baby cucumber and arugula for dinner before jumping in the shower. 8 p.m. — Make popcorn on the stove and eat it while texting my family on our group chat. My parents are in London and I am jealous. Try calling my sibling; they rarely pick up but I leave a message saying that I miss them and love them. They're in college in Chicago so we don't get to see each other much anymore. I pour myself a glass of leftover white wine, but it seems to have gone bad, so I pour it down the drain (something I wouldn't have done a year ago). I drink homemade kombucha instead and watch , which a friend recommended. 10:30 p.m. — Two episodes later, I'm loving this show! I wash my face and brush my teeth and crash. Crazy Friday night.

"8 a.m. — Wake up without my alarm! I make oatmeal and grind coffee beans in my ancient Magic Bullet and pray my roommates don't wake up. I'm babysitting very energetic kids today and need the caffeine. 12 p.m. — I love babysitting these kids because their mom is home the whole time, so my main job is entertainment while she can step in if things get out of hand. She heads out with the three-year-old to buy pretzels from a local bakery for lunch. Both kids want to share their delicious-smelling pretzels with me but unfortunately, I am intolerant to wheat. (I have IBS and mainly follow a low-FODMAP diet.) I eat Swedish Fish, though, while we play a candy-related game. 1:30 p.m. — Walk home with a check for $64 in my pocket. I wanted to stop by the gym but all of a sudden I feel awful. I was slightly feverish in the middle of the night last night and now am freezing even though it's 53 degrees outside. I dress entirely in fleece and heat up more leftover miso soup. 3 p.m. — My roommate comes downstairs looking awful; she thinks she has the flu — we're a house full of sickies. I walk to Rite Aid before I feel even worse and buy a thermometer, chicken soup for her, and a small body wash. Take my temperature and it's 96.9 degrees — normal. Weird... $11.21 4 p.m. — Make almond flour chocolate chip cookies and settle in for more before feeling exhausted. I can't sleep, but I lie in bed for two hours. 7 p.m. — I'm feeling good enough to meet a friend for dinner, but not good enough to walk the half mile there, so I shamelessly Uber. My Pool ride is $2.65, but I have credit on the app, so I don't pay anything. Have a great time catching up with my friend and congratulating her on a new job. I order pad see ew with chicken and it's pretty good. $12.65 8:30 p.m. — Feeling a lot better, so I walk home and stop at the grocery store on the way. I pick up cinnamon (I used the last of our communal one), gluten-free oats, Greek yogurt, and coconut milk. $15.52 11:30 p.m. — After watching more and drinking more kombucha, I pass out to the sweet sounds of my humidifier and my roommate coughing. Daily Total: $39.38",2,55
"10 a.m. — Wake up feeling fine! I head downstairs and make breakfast for the coming week. More is more in my book, so I cook the oats with cinnamon, cardamom, and frozen blueberries, and then portion it into jars and add chia, flax, hemp, and sunflower seeds, banana, peanut butter, maca, and Greek yogurt. Run downstairs and grab the Sunday . I almost cancelled my subscription when it increased to nearly $11 a week, but ended up negotiating a 50% off rate. Reading the paper is one of my favorite parts of the week and totally worth it to me. 1 p.m. — Get into yoga pants and then settle in for a ""Yoga with Adriene"" video. I love her and find her YouTube videos to be almost as good as real classes. 2:15 p.m. — Make a quick lunch of eggs and homemade corn tortillas that I make out of masa. Also throw together a huge arugula salad with cucumber and carrots. 3:30 p.m. — My roommate comes in toting a package that arrived for me. It's a belated birthday present from my aunt: a mandoline slicer! I call to thank her and we chat about an upcoming ski race we are both participating in. Then I make sweet potato chips to test out the mandoline. They're delicious. 4 p.m. — Do a free online practice LSAT test. I'm not even sure if I'm going to take the LSAT, let alone apply for law school, but I'm considering it and I love word problems! I also put a pot of brown rice, lentils, red pepper, and kale to cook on the stove. 5:50 p.m. — Get dressed for real this time and walk 10 minutes to meet my mentor at a Japanese restaurant I've been excited to visit. We connected on the phone when I started looking for jobs in the nutrition/anti-hunger field and started meeting up after I moved to the Boston area. She's the president of a micronutrient supplementation organization, so we always have interesting conversations about international versus national nutrition issues. We also chat about life. I love having her support. I order a tuna donburi bowl with miso soup and seaweed salad. It's pretty much my favorite dish ever. We split the bill and I pay $24.22, including tip. $24.22 7:30 p.m. — Arrive home, where my roommate is cooking with friends I haven't met yet. I make coconut milk hot chocolate with peppermint schnapps for everyone and we talk about all sorts of things. My dad also stops by to give me my new license plate tabs, which were sent to my parents' home in a different state. He works in Boston during the week and returns home on the weekends, which means I get to see him a lot. 10 p.m. — Watch more and drink ginger tea. I'm so awake after a sleep-heavy weekend. Finally fall asleep around midnight. Daily Total: $24.22",3,55
"7:30 a.m. — Eat my oats and drink coffee, then get dressed for work. I have a meeting with some of our partner organizations this morning, so I get to leave a bit later than usual. 9:30 a.m. — There was supposed to be coffee and breakfast, but it's not here. People are panicking a little and eating the hamentashen someone brought from home. Finally, at 10, Panera coffee and bagels arrive. I pour myself coffee and drink it black. We discuss issues we've been seeing and the upcoming Purim donation. 11:30 a.m. — Drive to my office where there's just enough time to heat up my lentils and rice before our weekly staff meeting. 2 p.m. — Go straight from one meeting to the next. I volunteered to be part of the Purim party planning committee. I'm not Jewish but I thought it would be fun to learn more. I snack on Greek yogurt with kiwi and peanuts during the meeting. 4 p.m. — Take a break from faxing documents and calling clients to make peppermint tea. I've been putting off ending things with a boy I met on Hinge and finally send him a text. We've only been on three dates so I feel like it's nicer to blame things on my breakup of nearly a year ago rather than tell him I'm just not feeling it. 5:15 p.m. — Arrive home after a stressful commute and go for a slow three-mile run, followed by a quick yoga routine. Heat up miso soup for dinner. 7 p.m. — Take a shower and put on my zebra print onesie. My roommate has a friend over and I have a great time hanging out with them and vetting Hinge dudes. I am supposed to have a date on Thursday with one of them, but my roommate's friend (who is a gay man) warns me that he's not going to be cute in person. My roommate said he's always right. I feel mean ghosting but am not sure what to do. 9 p.m. — Roommate's friend keeps pouring me glasses of Two-Buck Chuck cabernet sauvignon. It's actually really good. I decide to give the Hinge guy a chance. After the friend leaves, I head to bed, a bit too buzzed for a Monday night. Daily Total: $0",4,55
"7:30 a.m. — Wake up before my alarm. I got to sleep in a bit today because I'm heading to the State House. A partner organization is releasing a study linking food insecurity to health costs in Massachusetts. For my job, I also help contribute to SNAP policy at the state level, so it's important that I show our support. 8 a.m. — Eat my usual breakfast while I read the news and get upset about the world, so I research a possible trip to Spain to visit a friend instead. Look up flights online. I might be able to swing it! I've saved up almost 100,000 miles on Delta, which helps. Then I do yoga and get dressed in a get-shit-done outfit, including pearl earrings. 9:25 a.m. — Walk five minutes to the train and use my CharlieCard, which is already loaded. I don't get a monthly pass because I drive to work and don't use the train enough to justify it. 11 a.m. — The State House event is wonderful! There are many inspiring speeches by people on every side of this issue: the government, nonprofits, research organizations, and even a woman who receives food assistance. There are also lots of people I know here, which is great. I chat with a guy who's part of my SNAP Coalition and he ends up inviting me to get a drink at one of my favorite breweries, so I give him my number. It feels good to meet someone in real life after so many online disasters. 11:55 a.m. — Reload my CharlieCard and jump back on the train. Stop by my apartment to grab lunch, then drive to work. It's such a fast drive at this time of day! $9 12:20 p.m. — Get to work and eat my miso soup yet again, plus Greek yogurt with peanuts and half a banana. 1:50 p.m. — Make peppermint tea. Stalk the State House guy on Facebook – it looks like he has a girlfriend?! Text the Thursday date guy, message another Hinge guy and receive an email from someone my mom's friend connected me with. Feeling overwhelmed and very single the day before Valentine's Day. 3:45 p.m. — Snack on a Cara Cara orange, more peanuts, and make more peppermint tea. 5:30 p.m. — Get home from work and leave right away to my dad's apartment. Because his job is here, my parents have a place in the city. I have a key so I can use the apartment as well as the gym and pool. Sometimes I have people over on the weekends, which is a fun change of pace. There are Girl Scouts selling cookies at the train station, so of course, I have to stop. I was a Girl Scout and chat with them about camping for a while. I buy a box of Thin Mints for my dad. $5 6:30 p.m. — Give my dad the Thin Mints and head to his fancier-than-mine gym to do 15 minutes on the machines followed by a one-mile run. Then we head out to meet one of his friends for dinner at a place around the corner. 7:30 p.m. — Order a butternut squash and goat cheese salad with grilled chicken. It's great! My dad and his friend split the bill. 8:45 p.m. — We move on to the dive bar next door for trivia. My dad and his friend do it most weeks and are typically the oldest ones there by far, so they recruited me tonight for a millennial's wisdom. It pays off, as the first question is about Justin Timberlake and I know the answer immediately. My dad buys a round of Long Trail Ales on tap for all of us, and then his friend buys me another that I split with my dad. 11:15 p.m. — We get so close to winning! I stop by my dad's to grab my bag and then call an Uber home. I don't really like taking the train this late in this part of town. The Uber Pool is $16, which is crazy. I have $2 in credit and accidentally charge the rest to my parents' card, which is still on my Uber account from when I was younger. I will try and remember to pay them back... Daily Total: $14",5,55
"7 a.m. — My alarm goes off and I jump out of bed to start my normal routine. I quickly get dressed and make somewhat of an effort for Valentine's Day, wearing a rose-print shirt with pink earrings. Head out to work. 9:30 a.m. — We have a brief training on PTSD and trauma-related mental health issues. It's incredibly helpful because many of my clients have been through chronic trauma, and now I have a better understanding of why and how I should react. They have mandarins, so I eat one and sip on coffee. 11 a.m. — Snack on peanuts and drink peppermint tea. I plan a meeting with a colleague who has a client she has wanted to apply for SNAP for months, but it often takes our Holocaust survivor clients a long time to feel ready to deal with such a rigid government program. 1:35 p.m. — Heat up rice and lentils for lunch, and eat yogurt with fruit at my desk today because I am swamped with SNAP applications. 2:30 p.m. — I comment aloud that I was really hoping there would be chocolate around on Valentine's Day. My colleague tosses me a Ghirardelli Sea Salt Soiree square. Woo-hoo! 5:10 p.m. — Get home and chat with my roommate, who has finally emerged from her room after almost a week of the flu. I do a ""Yoga with Adriene"" video and then make eggs scrambled in dulse butter with kale for dinner. 7 p.m. — Head out for Galentine's Day with my roommate, decked out in eyeshadow and carrying a bottle of wine that's been sitting in my fridge. We split an UberPool because she's not feeling well enough to take the train. $2.61 7:45 p.m. — Finally arrive after one of the worst Uber rides of my life. I pass out Valentines that I made with the five-year-old I babysit to my friends. We drink wine, eat flourless chocolate cake, chocolate-covered strawberries, raspberries, crackers, and cheese, and catch up on everyone's life. So much friend love! 10:15 p.m. — Call another UberPool and split it. Spend the ride home chatting with my roommate and nixing the nine Hinge guys who are obviously feeling lonely on Valentine's Day and liked me. Once we get home, I take a quick shower and go straight to bed. $4.73 Daily Total: $7.34",6,55
"6:30 a.m. — Wake up to the news of another school shooting. How awful. Sometimes I can't believe the craziness that we live in right now. I eat breakfast and also see there's an Aerie sale. I add underwear and a kiwi-print bikini to my cart but don't check out yet. 8:22 a.m. — After nearly an hour of crazy Boston traffic and angry drivers, I arrive at our partner agency, where I assist with SNAP work on a biweekly basis. I pour myself coffee from their pot and add coconut milk creamer from their fridge. I'm not sure what their policy is here and whether the creamer is for sharing, so I pour quickly and sneakily. 11 a.m. — Head out to my office and snack on peanuts once I get there. 12:30 p.m. — Some of us do a ""Yoga with Adriene"" video at lunch on a big projector screen. It's such a good midday reset. 1:30 p.m. — Heat up more lentils and rice, and eat chia pudding with tons of cinnamon that I made this morning. The Hinge guy cancels our date and asks to reschedule. I take this as a sign and don't respond. 3:15 p.m. — My coworker brings over gluten-free cookies that were up for grabs in our kitchen. I look at the ingredients and I can actually eat them! Sometimes it's hard following the low FODMAP diet because I have to turn down most things, so I'm very happy. I save them for later. 4:35 p.m. — Leave work and stop by Trader Joe's on my way home. I buy Joe's O's, toilet paper, eggs, organic chicken breast, ground turkey, cocoa powder, Greek yogurt, a spaghetti squash, canned crushed tomatoes, coconut milk, feta, frozen blueberries, blood oranges, zucchini, carrots, kale, spinach, lemons, limes, a potato, bananas, and ginger tea. I also buy Greek yogurt, granola, tortellini, baby carrots, and bananas for my roommate (which she Venmos me for). $56.68 5:30 p.m. — Get home and go for a three-mile run. Then I steam the spaghetti squash in my roommate's Instant Pot while making a sauce on the stove with the ground turkey, canned tomatoes, zucchini, and spinach. I also have fennel going bad in my fridge, so I slice and roast it. 7:45 p.m. — Eat while watching and have some of the cookies for dessert. My iPhone has been bugging me for over a year to buy more iCloud storage because it's been unable to back up. I freak out about the possibility of losing everything and finally get a larger plan. $0.99 10 p.m. — Head to bed early, excited for a weekend where I am no longer sick! Daily Total: $57.67",7,55
"7:30 a.m. — Alarm goes off. Hurrah, it's Saturday! Have a bit of a lie-in and catch up with my boyfriend, who has been away for work for the past week. He makes coffee while we listen to the radio show and get ready for the park run. It's a lovely day and we leave at 8:50 to get to the start line. There are so many people here today – and we try to participate every Saturday morning if we can. While it might not be the first thing I want to do on a Saturday morning, it sets me up for the day and makes me feel pretty smug. Trying to improve my personal record each week is a good incentive – and it's free! 10:30 a.m. — Feeling fab, although my run today was 10 seconds slower than last week's personal record. Maybe next week? I take a long, luxurious shower and then have a breakfast of peanut butter and mashed banana on toast with another cafetière of coffee. Manage to fend BF off my second slice of toast and he makes himself more; he is an eating machine. Usually, we have our Ocado groceries delivered at this time each week (it's sort of like Whole Foods, but online), but because I wanted to make a nice meal for BF when he returned from his week away, I had everything delivered a few days ago. We spend about $120-$140 on food shopping per week, which comes out of our joint account. 12 p.m. — Pop into the center to pick up a bag that was being mended at L.K. Bennett. This is the second time I've bought this bag, and the strap broke. Not a happy bunny. Sadly, as it was three years since I'd bought it last, I couldn't quite wangle a replacement or a refund. Tip: Take things back within six months of purchase if they're broken (a.k.a. don't buy stuff and leave it at the bottom of your wardrobe for two years). However, they did fix it for free. You win some, etc. While we're out and about, we pop into Hatchards bookshop and buy three greetings cards ($10.10). We also pop into M&S to buy eggs because I have grand banana bread-making plans ($5.60). $15.70 2 p.m. — Home! And HUNGRY. (BF perhaps more than me.) Thankfully, we have a pile of leftovers from last night's North Thai feast, which I made with a spice delivery box we were gifted when we booked a holiday. We have coconut chicken noodle soup, spicy pork sausages, prawn crackers, pickled pak choi, pak choi leaves, cucumber, and baba ganoush. Yum! We settle in on the sofa and my boyfriend watches rugby while I attempt to plan a friend's hen do. We're nearly there but organizing so many other people is a challenge! She is one of my best friends, though, and I am really happy to be doing it for her. The wedding is this summer and we are all really excited! Wed-min is briefly interrupted by a phone call from my best friend, who shares some very exciting news with me. Whooping ensues. 4 p.m. — Whooping over, I scour the internet for shorts to buy for our forthcoming trip to Costa Rica. My boyfriend and I are going for two and a half weeks, and I can't ruddy wait! I haven't had a proper long holiday in a long time. I find a pair on sale from Lululemon and buy them ($19.71), only to be dismayed 20 minutes later when I receive a message telling me that my order is cancelled. Apparently, they are out of stock. They need a better stock notification system! Brokenhearted, I continue to scour the web but, alas, none are as good. I decide to leave the shorts for now. 6 p.m. — Food time! We're going to have to be quick, as we're heading to my boyfriend's friend's birthday party later. I heat up leftover fish curry I made during the week. We're still pretty full from our lunch feast so after eating, I hastily slap makeup on and get changed. We leave bearing a bottle of gin from our booze shelf and take the train way down south of the river. We get to the party and my boyfriend's friend is making cocktails (read: pouring glasses of tequila). I have a great time! His friends are great but the tequilas prove a little too much for BF's friend and he throws up in the garden. 3 a.m. — Tequila, limoncello, espresso martinis, and god knows what else consumed, it's time to go home. Party host is passed out in an armchair. We share a taxi up to North London with a friend. The ride makes me pretty nauseous, which I mistakenly vocalize, and then spend the rest of the (ruddy long) taxi journey convincing the poor driver that I will not vomit all over his car. Mission accomplished. We arrive home, no chundering done. BF pays for the Uber, though to be honest, I can't remember ordering it anyway. I wash my face, brush my teeth, and fall into bed with a bucket on the side. I don't throw up, but the world is spinning. Daily Total: $15.70",1,56
"7 a.m. — Oh great. I'm awake. Not feeling anywhere near as bad as I should but still very, very tired. BF brings me Berocca and coffee, and I doze whilst listening to BBC Radio 4. (It makes me feel safe.) 9:30 a.m. — I finally haul myself out of bed and make an avocado toast and green tea, hoping it will sort me out, and continue scouring the internet for shorts. None are as good as the ones I couldn't buy yesterday. Also, why are all the things I like are so blooming expensive?! I resist any ridiculous leisurewear purchases and put on my running clothes. 11 a.m. — Finally out of the door and running around the park. Being outside feels good, although I don't feel like I have much in my legs! That'll be the tequila. I am cheered on by all the lovely dogs out for their walks in the park. Once I'm home, we eat baked sweet potatoes, blue cheese, and salad bits left over in the fridge. I also open a tin of stuffed vine leaves in the cupboard because I am hungry! 2 p.m. — We settle on the sofa again and BF watches rugby. I have a delightful nap, and then get up at about 5 p.m. and start making the aforementioned banana bread. BF assists as sous chef. Still hungover, tired, and therefore hungry, we make a very classy dinner of chicken Kiev (food of the gods), some sort of vegetable-y quinoa packet, and salad-y bits. We then have our Sunday night ritual of watching C (no apology), but this time with delicious chocolatey banana bread. 7 p.m. — We make our lunches for the next day (falafel salad) and get our bags organized for the week. I spend a bit of time researching further exams I want to take, and see if I can find a way of getting work to fund them. We get into bed at approximately 8:30 p.m. (PARTY CENTRAL), and read our books until we pass out. It's been a busy weekend. Daily Total: $0",2,56
"5:15 a.m. — Alarm goes off. I'm supposed to go to a body pump class at the local gym but I'm not feeling it. Decide I'll go for a run instead. Reset alarm for 6:30. 6:30 comes. Still not up for it. Boyfriend gets up and ready for work and brings me coffee. 8 a.m. — Boyfriend leaves for work. I appear to still be in bed. Decide I'm going to work from home today. I finally haul myself out of bed at 8:45 and go for a lovely long run in the beautiful sunshine. 9:30 a.m. — Back home and showered. I eat peanut butter banana toast and drink coffee, and then sit at my desk (a.k.a. dining room table) going through my emails, still feeling Saturday night. Today is going to be fun. The two-and-a-half-week holiday that I have coming up means that there is a slightly scary amount to do before then. Not helped by a judgment that came out last week, which completely threw off the case strategy of a related matter I'm dealing with. 3 p.m. — I think about taking a walk in the sunshine, but it doesn't happen. Grab my lunch out of the fridge and work whilst I munch. 7 p.m. — Still working but think it might be time to make dinner. Boyfriend has meetings in another town today and will be home late, so I start on with dinner without him. I make tofu pad Thai but realize we're out of noodles, so am excruciatingly middle class and use quinoa instead. Settle down with a bowl of quinoa Thai on the sofa watching . So trashy, but so satisfying. Boyfriend is finally home, so I warm up some of my masterpiece for him and we catch up on our days. We make our packed lunches for tomorrow (leftover quinoa Thai, salad, tzatziki, and stuffed vine leaves) and have banana bread and herbal tea. We hit the sack at about 10 p.m. Daily Total: $0",3,56
"5:15 a.m. — Alarm goes off. I get up, chuck my gym clothes on, throw my lunch in my bag, and am out the door and on the bus! Get to the gym at 6:30, and do gentle jogging on the treadmill. Then I take a 30-minute killer HIIT class. Afterward, I shower off and meet some girlfriends for breakfast at 7:30. I order green baked eggs and a cappuccino and we catch up on life. We realize we haven't seen each other for ages, so we get our calendars out and make plans to meet for dinner on the following Monday, as this is the only time that will work before I go on holiday. $20.15 8:45 a.m. — I'm in work mode and there is a lot to do. I prepare evidence (which I love doing) and field emails and calls from clients. 12:45 p.m. — Stop for lunch with some colleagues. We go down to our firm's café and catch up on our weekends and lives. Back at my desk, I see that I'm scheduled to do a presentation on the judgment I mentioned earlier. Add this to my increasingly long to-do list. Still working on the evidence. (I will be for days.) Text my boyfriend to ask when he'll be home. He replies saying he'll be home before me, so I task him with making pancake batter. Decide I'm not going to make it until dinner, so I go down to the café and buy a slice of banana bread. I feel a bit sorry for the poor banana bread sitting at home, but at least the one I made is better. $3.50 7:15 p.m. — Take the train home, where it's pancake time! I had grand plans of making fancy pancakes but by the time I get home, I can't be bothered to make a fun sauce. We settle for cheese, sriracha, and cured beef that Ocado had in its flash sale. BF has been a superhero and baked salmon that was in the freezer for lunches whilst he was waiting for me to come home. I repay the favor by making salmon salad for lunch for tomorrow. Too full for more banana bread. We're in bed by 10:30 and asleep pretty soon after. Daily Total: $23.65",4,56
"5:45 a.m. — I have been awake since 4:45. Excellent. Finally get out of bed when my alarm goes off at 5:15, chuck lunch into my bag, put my gym clothes on, and head to a barre class at 7 a.m. It's tough, but enjoyable, especially since the teacher is playing really aggressive hip-hop. Once I'm showered and dressed, I walk to work. 9 a.m. — Breakfast time. I usually get a free coffee at the gym, but the machine is broken (it tries to serve me a cup of hot milk), so down to the office café I go. To be fair, they have really good coffee, but it's just a bit pricey for an office coffee shop. I get a coffee and a bircher muesli. Back at my desk, I do my usual email-fielding and evidence prep. $5 2:30 p.m. — Meeting with my boss and a junior to discuss evidence in this tricky case. Boss is clearly as flummoxed as I am by the recent judgment. We spend three hours trying to work out what to do. Thankfully, our meeting is in the partners dining room, so I take advantage of the free coffee, sweets, fruit, and biscuits, and leave feeling slightly sick ... but like we might be getting somewhere with the case. 6:45 p.m. — Get back to my desk, write up a few drafts, and then realize it's nearly 7 p.m. 8 p.m. — Finally home, and BF has defrosted and heated beef stew from the freezer, which we eat with brown rice and parmesan on the top. Yum. BF washes up, I make packed lunches, and we're in bed by 10:30 with our books. I am exhausted and pass out pretty quickly. Gosh, we are an exciting couple. Daily Total: $5",5,56
"5:15 a.m. — Ruddy alarm. Time to get up! I am bone tired but aware of the stack of work I have to do. So I throw myself out of bed, get dressed, and am out and on the bus by 5:45. Get to the gym for a 6:45 HIIT class. I'm feeling tired and it's not my best one. I struggle through as best as I can and am grateful when it's over! Into the shower and get dressed. 7:45 a.m. — At my desk, preparing my presentation for lunchtime today. Joy. Make a pit stop at the office café and get a cappuccino and a bircher ($5.05). Take a break and see that Lululemon's ""We Made Too Much"" page has been refreshed — and they have excellent shorts. In my size. AND IT'S PAYDAY! I also pick a pair of cropped workout leggings and two new pairs of socks. ($127...whoops!) $132.05 12:30 p.m. — Presentation time! It goes fine, although I hear myself volunteering to do a case note for distribution to clients. Sure, yes, I'll do that. Have a really interesting discussion about various issues that the judgment has raised, and get back to my desk at 1:30 to eat my lunch. I receive a text from my dentist reminding me about the I checkup booked for this evening. Good job they did, as I had forgotten. 2 p.m. — Someone left a pile of candy out in the office. The dentist trip later is not enough to deter me from polishing off approximately 10 delicious, chewy sweets. My mouth hurts from the sugar. 4:30 p.m. — A colleague swings by and asks if I would fancy a coffee. I could do with a break, so I thankfully agree. We pop out with another colleague and I buy them both coffee since they usually buy mine. Get a lemongrass tea for myself, as I am coffee-d out. I eat roasted nuts and dried apple with it, and get back to the office for an in-depth chat with a partner about a case we're working on. $12 6:45 p.m. — Crap, it's time to go to the dentist! I have been going to a private dentist for a few years now because I just couldn't find an in-network one in London whom I trusted. The one I've found is amazing and not completely extortionate, the only problem is that the office is down in South London. I hop on the Thameslink and get there by 7:30. Have a great chat about how I'm a tooth grinder (and wear a fairly heavy duty mouthguard at night – sexy stuff), but often find myself clenching my jaw during the day. She does an X-ray of my teeth and says that I haven't done myself too much damage, but perhaps I should try yoga or meditation. I had prepaid part of my appointment, so only pay for the X-ray. $25 8 p.m. — Hop on the train, then Tube home, and arrive to find that my boyfriend made one of my favorite guilty pleasures: Linda McCartney deep-filled country pies, with sweet potato chips and baked beans, plus mayo and sriracha on the side. Food of the gods! Then it's our usual routine of making packed lunches for the next day, packing bags, and getting in bed by 10. Extra snaps to BF for putting a hot water bottle in the bed when I wasn't looking. He's pretty brilliant. Asleep pretty quickly, since I am exhausted (as always). Daily Total: $169.05",6,56
"6 a.m. — FRIDAY! I'm up and out the door for my spinning class. The instructor put on some banging tunes, and I really go for it. Shower at the studio and have a brief chat with the instructor in the changing rooms. We bond over our love of the same Brazilian booty cream. I get home and see that BF left me half a cafetière of coffee. I boil the kettle, pour half a cup of black coffee, and top it up with hot water. Then I start working, reading through the legal news and case law updates and tackling my inbox. 11 a.m. — The door buzzer sounds: It's Ocado! Run down the stairs and let the delivery man in. We ordered mixed peppers, chicken thigh fillets, little gem lettuce, zucchini, onions, mozzarella, blueberries, asparagus, yogurt, radishes, green beans, spinach, cherry tomatoes, milk, cheddar, carrots, avocados, sugar snap peas, a cucumber, leeks, hummus, baby sprouts, chicken sausage, pancetta, flaked almonds, quinoa, granola, crumpets, canned chickpeas, eggs, roasted nuts, canned butter beans, sweet potatoes, artichoke hearts, gochujang chili, Braeburn apples, chicken gyoza, and edamame beans. Every week, we also include a $7 contribution (which Ocado matches) to a local food bank. This food ($109 total) will last us for the week, plus some meat I have in the freezer from previous Ocado flash sales. I'll probably use the few hours I have free on Saturday to do some batch cooking for the week. 11:30 a.m. — I'm hungry, so I make avocado toast. The avocado is slightly on the unripe side and mashing it up is a bit of a challenge but I'm game. I sit down and get on with further work. This morning, it's time to go through all of my bills. It's painful as usual but it has to be done! I have a call with a junior about a case we are working on, and work through the drafts the juniors sent through to me over the last few days. I love this part of my job because I really enjoy working with others and the teaching aspect of it. It's so rewarding to see people improve and develop. It also keeps you on your toes – you have to know your stuff! 3 p.m. — I'm hungry. It's time for my packed salmon salad. I found dried wakame in the cupboard last night, so I put that in it too. Salad is followed by a cup of tea and banana bread. We have a dinner reservation at 7 p.m and I don't want to starve until then? 6:15 p.m. — BF is home, and it is OFFICIALLY THE WEEKEND! I get changed out of my comfy clothes and into a nice dress. Put on minimal makeup, and we walk down to the restaurant in Stoke Newington. I have been wanting to try this place for ages – it's a seafood tapas restaurant, serving seafood sourced from Scotland. We gorge on oysters, garlic prawns, patatas bravas, squid, tortilla, tomato bread, fried eggplant, and pig cheeks, and manage to fit in a cheeky chocolate brownie for dessert. We share a bottle of wine, too. At about 11 p.m., we roll home, make herbal tea, and get into bed. We've got a busy weekend ahead, so it's time for some shut-eye! $52 Daily Total: $52",7,56
"8:30 a.m. — I get to sleep in on Thursdays for an extra hour because the Zumba class I like doesn't start until 9 a.m. I get up, brush my teeth, get dressed, and go to my gym. Then I head home, eat breakfast, and shower. I make the same breakfast every morning: mushrooms, cooked spinach, egg whites, turkey bacon, tomatoes, and mozzarella. It's delicious and healthy. 11 a.m. — I haven't gotten my nails done in a month and I'm going away next weekend, so I decide it's time. I get a pedicure, gel manicure, and a lip wax, and read while I sit. (The nail technician gives me looks since the book is called .) I like to tip well at places I go to on a regular basis, so I tip $16. $89.31 12:30 p.m. — Nails are done and it's time to go to work. I love gel because I don't have to worry about messing it up. I take the bus and get off a bit early to get a chai from Starbucks with my preloaded card. 3 p.m. — I get to work and realize none of my bosses are in, so our staff meeting is cancelled, I guess. My coworkers and I decide to hold our own meeting to discuss issues we've wanted to bring up to our bosses. One of my coworkers orders buffalo wings for everyone. 7 p.m. — Workday is slow until a case comes in. Once the family arrives, the children are interviewed and the paperwork is completed by 10:30 p.m. My shift usually ends at 9 p.m., unless something like this comes up. If a child is being abused, the situation has to be figured out right then and there to ensure there is a safe place for the child. I decide to stick around to make sure everyone leaves okay and because my office only pays for cabs after 11 p.m. So at least I get a free cab ride home. ($14.39 expensed) 12 p.m. — Finally get home, say hi to my fiancé, wash my face, put away my stuff from the day, and head to bed, exhausted. Daily Total: $89.31",1,57
"7:30 a.m. — Time to get up and go to the gym. I don't have to go to work until 3 p.m. today to make up for late nights, but I have a ton of things to do around the house. I go to the gym and then get groceries on my way home: milk, beans, Kleenex, avocados, cold cuts, spinach, tomatoes, mushrooms, bananas, cucumbers, mozzarella cheese, cottage cheese, onions, and Ziploc bags. $74.50 1 p.m. — I get home, make my breakfast, cook cauliflower rice taco bowls for next week, clean the apartment, and spend time with my fiancé before he has to leave for his meeting. 3 p.m. — I'm just about to start napping when my fiancé complains that we don't spend a lot of time together. We make tentative plans for dinner tonight, but it depends on whether a case comes. I leave for work and get my chai on the way. 6 p.m. — At work, I get hit with a case immediately and spend a few hours interviewing and taking care of that family. When I finish, I'm starving, so I pull out the cauliflower rice shrimp stir fry I brought for my lunch yesterday and eat that with a Babybel cheese. I try to catch up on paperwork but I can only do so much because our phones aren't working, so I order a present for my friend's baby shower on Sunday. I know she's going to yell at me because she thinks I've spent too much on her already. I really haven't though, and this is something I want to do. I buy a diaper garbage can. (I've already bought a lot of baby clothes because I just can't resist.) $38.08 7:45 p.m. — Luckily, the case we thought was coming in doesn't, so we can leave a bit early today! I meet my fiancé at a restaurant we have a Groupon for. It's a nice evening of wine tasting and good food. We didn't realize our Groupon deal didn't include dessert, so we were a bit surprised by the bill, but still happy. It may be worth coming back to — with a Groupon deal, of course. $40.38 12 a.m. — We get home and start snoozing on the couch, so I change into my PJs. But then my fiancé gets a text and hears yelling outside our window. It's our friends who want us to come out with them for pie. Random, but doesn't sound bad to me, so we change and leave for a nearby diner where I get a waffle and chocolate milk. (When I go to diners, I to get chocolate milk.) My fiancé orders a baked potato, chicken fingers, cake, and beer. (I guess one dinner wasn't enough.) We split the bill with our friends. What a fun, random night. $40 1:30 a.m. — Get home, exhausted. I wash my face, change into my PJs for the second time, and crash. Daily Total: $192.96",2,57
"8:20 a.m. — Wake up for the gym. Though I'm tired, I know today is going to be filled with eating and drinking, so I get myself to a boot camp class. I get my butt kicked and then stop by Starbucks for my chai, which I buy with my prepaid card. 11 a.m. — Get home, make my usual breakfast, shower, and head out the door to meet my friends for brunch. 1 p.m. — There's a wait for the brunch place and look around for another option, but everywhere else has a wait, too. When we finally get seated at the original place, I am soaked. (I forgot it was going to rain today.) I order biscuits and gravy, which are delicious. I don't eat pork, so I get excited when there is a gravy that I can eat. I also get an apple cider mimosa that's heavier on the apple cider. This is probably for the better because we're going to a wine-tasting class after this. $23.59 3 p.m. — My two friends and I were gifted a wine-tasting class for our birthdays. It ends up being a great day of games and cheese. I am babysitting later and have time to kill beforehand, so we go to Shake Shack. I get the 'shroom burger and it is good, but probably not worth the extra $2 compared to the regular burger. $7.94 6:30 p.m. — Get to my babysitting job right on time. I've been with these kids for three years and it's a nice way to make some extra cash. When I interact with kids at my day job, it's usually in sad situations, so this is a nice change. We watch TV and read books and then the kids go to bed early. 10 p.m. — Head to my friend's apartment for game night. I hang out for a bit and play ""Saboteur"" with my friends and their boyfriends, whom I really like. We end up leaving a little after midnight and I get a lift home from my friend's boyfriend who lives a few blocks away from me. I get home, talk to my fiancé for a bit, and go to bed after a long, rain-drenched – but fun — day. Daily Total: $31.53",3,57
"9 a.m. — I wake up, clean the living room and kitchen, and then head to a kickboxing class. I usually do two classes on Sundays, but I'm helping my friend set up her baby shower today and only have time for one. 10:30 a.m. — I get home from the class, make breakfast, clean the bathroom and shower, and  then pick up the food for the shower. I chose an ""afternoon tea"" theme and preordered tea sandwiches, a bakery platter, and pink cupcakes from a great bakery in my neighborhood. I was going to take the subway since she lives one stop away from me, but the food comes in two massive boxes and it's pouring. I can barely carry everything and end up having someone help me hail a cab. $8.30 7 p.m. — The baby shower is a great success. My friend wasn't sure she wanted one since she only moved here a few years ago and doesn't know many people, but she ends up having a great time. She and her husband keep trying to pay me back for the food, but I tell them repeatedly I want to pay because she's always extremely generous. 8 p.m. — My fiancé and I get home and relax for a little bit. I end up in bed at 9:30, partly because I'm going to try to wake up at 5:20 a.m. for the gym tomorrow, and partly because I am just exhausted from the weekend. Daily Total: $8.30",4,57
"5:20 a.m. — I manage to get up and go to the gym. I haven't been able to do this in about a month, but I won't be able to hit the gym tomorrow and I'm going out of town on Thursday, so it's now or never. I hit a body pump class, which is great for people who need help with strength training. I get home, realize our Internet is out, put on a DVD, make breakfast, shower, and chill for a little bit before work. Stop for my chai on my way. 9 a.m. — Make it to work, get myself settled, catch up on paperwork, and meet with my intern. She's great and I'm excited to see all the progress she's making. My fiancé made me quinoa, butternut squash, and chicken. He's an excellent cook, which makes my life better. 4 p.m. — Help a coworker practice her interviewing skills and then head out of the office with my intern. She has class and I'm meeting a friend for dinner in a similar area. 5:30 p.m. — I meet my friend at Kashkaval for fondue. We met at my old job and it's great to have a friend who is also a social worker. We catch up over happy hour wine, truffle fondue, and hummus. We both complain about long hours and being underpaid and overworked. She is one of the nicest people I've met in a long time. We talk each other into getting chocolate bread pudding before calling it a night. $50.08 9:30 p.m. — Another friend of mine is here for work and staying a few blocks away from the restaurant. I meet him at his hotel and we go to a bar around the corner to catch up. I don't see him often because he lives across the country, but we talk all the time and it's really nice to talk in person. We get a few drinks and then he insists on going to Starbucks since we're both big fans and it's still open. I don't get anything, though, and head home after. $27.26 11:30 p.m. — I get home exhausted, talk to my fiancé for a bit, wash my face, take out my schoolwork for tomorrow, and then go to bed. Daily Total: $77.34",5,57
"7:50 a.m. — I oversleep and wake up 20 minutes after my alarm, but my job is pretty relaxed as far as when we get into work. I get ready and arrive only 10 minutes late. 12 p.m. — A case comes up and I quickly heat up my lunch (homemade tomato meat sauce with spaghetti squash and a Babybel cheese). I always eat quickly at work because things can happen at any second. 3 p.m. — My coworker's adorable toddler comes to the office and I spend the rest of my day playing with her. Five o'clock rolls around and I leave to make it to class. 6 p.m. — I grab a Starbucks chai before my trauma class, which is really interesting and very useful in my current job. I'm two classes away from my second master's and am so excited to be done with going to work and school at the same time. 8 p.m. — I finish class and text a friend I'm supposed to get dinner with. He tells me he's still at work and isn't sure when he's going to get off, so I go home and make myself a quick avocado toast with poached eggs and feta. It's my first time making poached eggs successfully! I spend the rest of the evening packing for my upcoming trip, and get to bed around 11 p.m. Daily Total: $0",6,57
"7:20 a.m. — I wake up, make the bed, and leave for a weight class at the gym. Then I stop at the grocery store to get mushrooms, egg whites, eggs, and spinach for breakfasts. $13.47 1 p.m. — Get to work and then head to the Bronx with a coworker and my boss to assist an interview training. At least I'll be out of the office for a bit. 5 p.m. — A coworker begs me to bring Starbucks back to the office so I ask my boss if he wants anything since he's driving us back. I buy him a coffee as well. $11.87 9 p.m. — After an exhausting case, I go home. I was supposed to see my friend again today, but he is working late and I need to ensure I have everything for my trip. (I'm leaving straight from work tomorrow.) My fiancé arrives home and we go to bed early. Daily Total: $25.34",7,57
"7:30 a.m. — I wake up to my alarm and immediately run into my home office to call a plumber. My job is managing vacation rentals, and guests called me last night with a water heater problem. The plumber doesn't answer, so I leave a message and make a note to call again in an hour. I go downstairs and have a handful of strawberries. This definitely isn't a substantial breakfast, but I love fresh strawberries and they tide me over. I take a shower and get ready for the day. 8:15 a.m. — My husband calls me while I'm in the shower, and when I call him back, he tells me the battery in his truck is shot. Apparently, ​this is not uncommon, according to online forums, but Chevy won't warranty trucks past 36,000 miles. So my husband buys a new battery from an auto parts store; they give him a military discount, but it still hurts. He brings it home to install himself. $205 9 a.m. — My husband leaves for work and announces he is treating himself to Chick-fil-A because of the morning he has had. $6.50 9:45 a.m. — I grab a Pop-Tart and leave the house. I show up for my annual doctor's appointment only to remember it was rescheduled but I forgot to change the date in my phone. Oops. I head out and stop at the gas station. I've worked from home for the last year and rarely leave the house, so I usually only have to fill up once a month or so. Gas prices have gone up and the total is $30.63. I go to Target to waste time until my next appointment and manage to make it out without spending anything. Success! $30.63 10:45 a.m. — I run by Chick-fil-A for a Diet Coke ($2.09) before my nail appointment – it's a tradition. Then I run next door to get my nails done. I get a gel manicure every two weeks ($30). $32.09 11:30 a.m. — On my way home, I'm tempted to grab a quick lunch from somewhere but I talk myself out of it. My husband and I were discussing our finances the other day and decided we spend way too much money eating out. I resolve to eat lunch at home today and eat popcorn and other snacks while I watch TV. 2 p.m. — Last year I took a second job doing bookkeeping for an executive coach. He also has an ownership interest in another company that I took over bookkeeping for. I get a text from the woman who runs that company asking me to double check some stuff, so I head over to the office and then run a couple short errands for them as well. I get home around 3:15 and am starving. I don't want to fix a proper meal because my husband and I have a date night tonight, so I eat a bag of chips and a couple Girl Scout cookies. 4 p.m. — My husband comes home with a big surprise: Instead of going out to eat, he wants to go to Disney World. We don't take many spontaneous trips to Disney, but I'm always game! We get ready in about 20 minutes and jet out the door. We have annual passes, so no charge to get in. We stop for snacks, including Diet Coke, Mountain Dew, chips, Corn Nuts, and a Snickers bar on the way there ($11.47) and get stuck in awful traffic that turns our two-and-a-half-hour drive into a four-hour drive. While sitting in traffic, I place an order on Amazon for new vacuum filters and a small ice cube tray ($35.92). I've been on a DIY cleaning supplies kick lately and next on my list are dishwasher pods. This tray should make pods that just fit in our dispenser. Also included in the order are drain cleaners and other small household things. $47.39 8 p.m. — We pay for preferred parking once we're there ($45) so we don't have to walk forever when the park closes at midnight. Our first stop is dinner. We get seated in about 10 minutes and have delicious pizza and salad ($62.17). Then we go on some rides and my husband gets a Mickey Mouse ice cream ($5). We ride a few more rides and then are ready to go home. We stop at a candy store to get sugar to pep us up for the drive home ($10.38) and also stop for gas ($31.92). At 2:30 a.m., we finally get home​ and pass out. $154.47 Daily Total: $476.08",1,58
"9:45 a.m. — Finally awake. I'm too old to be up past midnight. Drag myself out of bed at around 10 and do a little work that came in overnight. My husband goes to the gym and we agree to meet up afterward to go grocery shopping. I'm not very hungry but I eat strawberries for breakfast. 11 a.m. — My husband is what you would call a planner and he likes to grocery shop on payday weekend for everything we need for two weeks of meals. We buy lots of fresh produce, eggs for my husband's breakfasts, dairy, and snacks. I check for honey mangos because I love making refrigerator oatmeal with them. They're not in season yet but hope springs eternal. Looks like bagels for breakfast instead. Our coupons and sales save us $50. We go home and I resist the urge to suggest going out for lunch. I have mac and cheese instead. $175 1 p.m. — I do work for my second job. Fighting with Amazon to try to get our products listed is like beating my head against a brick wall. I take a break to go downstairs and prep freezer meals. I'm all about convenience. I realize I completely forgot lemon juice, so I run back to the grocery store for it ($1.39). While I'm out, my husband decides to fix a drawer in the kitchen that falls on our feet every time we pull it out. He and his sister run to the hardware store to get a new drawer slide ($7.47). Small projects like this (and larger ones) seem never-ending in this house. My husband brings home a flyer from the store for 24 months with no interest if we use our store credit card and tells me he has scheduled a measurement appointment for someone to come measure our back doors. They were rusting when we moved in and need to be replaced eventually. $8.86 5 p.m. — I start prepping dinner and dessert (paella with chicken and sausage and a small cake). I pack up half of the dessert and take the dogs to go visit my grandparents. I try to see them every weekend. My husband comes over for a bit as well and we finally head home around 10 p.m. Daily Total: $183.86",2,58
"7:30 a.m. — We wake up and get ready to take the dogs to the beach. I eat a clementine and drink a Diet Coke to tide me over. We live about five minutes away from the beach and I promised myself that I would try to spend more time outside this year. I've become a real homebody in the last year and I miss fresh air and sunshine. I drag my husband out and we walk the dogs for a bit. They love it. 8:30 a.m. — We get home and I have a bagel for my real breakfast, while my husband prepares his breakfast for the week (eggs and sausage crumbles). We leave around 9:30 to run to the office of my second job. We have been having serious internet problems at the office, and my IT husband has offered to help, so we go and troubleshoot. 10 a.m. — We get home and my husband meal preps his lunches for the week. I could never be as dedicated as he is. I need variety. I work on revamping our QuickBooks while he works on food. We track our finances using QB, and he doesn't feel like he's keeping track of our expenditures well enough. I offer to take it over from here on out because it is my job, after all. 1 p.m. — I finally sit down for lunch (paella leftovers from the night before) and play on my iPad while my husband watches a movie. 1:30 p.m. — I head back to my grandparents with one of the dogs to meet my sister and work on a little project she needs to use my grandfather's power tools for. The whole thing is a little ridiculous, but my grandparents enjoy the time spent with them and my dog enjoys the sunshine and people. I make it home just in time to start dinner. 4:15 p.m. — I get home and start creamy garlic chicken and rice for dinner. It's a new recipe and I ask my husband and sister-in-law for feedback. They all love it. Looks like it will make it into our rotation. I didn't know very much about cooking when I first met my husband, but I taught myself a lot (thanks, Pinterest!), and after we bought our new house and my sister-in-law moved in with us a year into our marriage, it started getting really expensive to eat out. Plus with me working from home, there's really no excuse for me to not make dinner. I'm definitely no Julia Child, but I can whip up some decent meals. 7 p.m. — I return a few work emails and prepare stuff for tomorrow. Daily Total: $0",3,58
"7 a.m. — Wake up to my husband coming home from the gym. He goes six days a week — I just don't have that kind of dedication. I eat a bagel for breakfast and get ready for the day. Return a couple of work emails and laugh to myself. PSA: When you're booking a vacation rental, don't use your spam email address; you will lose important paperwork that way. 8:45 a.m. — I start laundry, grab a clementine, and rush to the office to let in the window replacement company so they can finish replacing the windows in the old building we work in. I get a little work done while I wait. The guy is sketchy as hell but there are a couple of other people across the hall who keep wandering by the door to check on me and I spend most of the time on the phone with my sister. 11:30 a.m. — The window guy finishes in time for me to go downtown and have lunch with my husband. He is going to start working from home full-time soon, and we won't have an excuse to go to this part of town that has amazing restaurants. While we eat, he tells me he solved a dilemma with the new computer he's building, but it necessitated him buying a new fan cable ($7.86). I don't understand any of it, but he built my computer and two of his own, so I figure he must know what he's doing. Lunch at a Japanese restaurant comes out to $27.37. (It was okay, but I wouldn't go back.) $35.23 3:15 p.m. — My sister-in-law and I head to Home Depot. She needs to return a shower caddy and I pick up several flower pots, which I paint and sell. (I only make about $30-$50 per month from them.) Someone recently requested a couple in football team colors and I was really impressed with how they turned out, so I'm going to paint several more and see if I get any traction around town. $45.12 4 p.m. — My husband gets home and we decide on chicken parmesan in the Dutch oven for dinner tonight. I doubt he remembers but this is one of the first meals I made for him after we met; it's also one of my favorite quick meals. (That's a great side benefit to planning two weeks worth of meals. If we don't feel like something one night, we just swap with another night's meal.) It's a beautiful night, so I open the windows to get fresh air and turn off the A/C. We don't get many spring days and I plan on enjoying the ones we have. We watch and then I crawl into bed around 9:30 because I am exhausted. Daily Total: $80.35",4,58
"8 a.m. — I eat a bagel for breakfast and work on dinner (taco chili). I brown the turkey and mix everything together. Half goes in the Crock-Pot and half in a freezer bag to save for later. 10 a.m. — I have a hair appointment at 10 a.m. Every winter I try to do fun fashion colors in my hair. My stylist is amazing and always up for an experiment. I consider my second job a success if it pays for my hair appointment every month. Usually, it does. This time is just a color touch-up and a trim, plus I buy more shampoo from her. Every time I see her, my appointments are at least three hours, so we always order lunch from the Panera across the parking lot and alternate paying for each other. This time was her turn, so lunch is free! $200.80 12:30 p.m. — I run to the grocery store on my way home to buy a box of Arm & Hammer Super Washing Soda I need to make dishwasher tablets. I'm all about making my own stuff to be green and save money, but I refuse to use something subpar, no matter how much money it saves. I sure hope these work! $3.95 1:30 p.m. — I see an online ad for a kitchen appliance that defrosts meat in minutes. I get a coupon code from clicking on the ad and figure, The reviews seem great. It's $27.33, but if it means I don't have to remember to thaw the chicken and turkey the night before, I'm all about it. $27.33 2 p.m. — I get a call from an acquaintance who is opening a boutique and wants to know if I can help with bookkeeping and inventory. Because of the time crunch (she opens in 10 days), I quote her a high fee, which she seems totally fine with. We agree to meet in two days to get things whipped into shape. My husband calls afterward to say he found new workout supplements that are cheaper than his old ones, so he orders them ($54.22). Things have been very stressful since his mom passed away and the gym provides a steady routine that helps his mental well-being immensely​. $54.22 5:30 p.m. — My sister-in-law gets home while I'm fixing dinner. She's angry because a customer at the grocery store where she works took advantage of her by making her cart his groceries across four lanes of traffic to his law office. She didn't know what to do, so she agreed because “the customer is always right.” I encourage her to talk to her manager to see what their policy is so she doesn't have to do things like this in the future. Sometimes she doesn't know how to handle situations, and we try to give her as much guidance as possible so she can eventually transition out of our house and onto her own. My husband gets home and we have taco chili. 7:30 p.m. — My husband is playing a computer game with several of his friends tonight, so I take the quiet time to look up recipes and teach myself to use the Square inventory system. I check the mail and find a bill from my doctor for my allergy test. My husband has great insurance through his company (which handles health informational services), but unfortunately, ​they don't cover this. Bummer. I pay online and finally go to bed around 10:30. $115 Daily Total: $401.30",5,58
"8 a.m. — My alarm goes off and I jump out of bed and grab a bagel. I do vacation rental work before I have a work call at 9 a.m. for job number two, which wraps up pretty quickly. We're having a serious problem with the guy who is supposed to be developing our website and I agree to be the point person on the project because I think the other lady is being way too nice to him. 9:45 a.m. — I grab a clementine and taco chili leftovers and head into the office of my second job. My boss is in today, which is always fun (not being sarcastic). He shows me the new retro mini fridge that got delivered to the office and I set up our new printer. We recently revamped the office and he has been really accommodating in terms of what might make my life easier. He's a keeper! 12 p.m. — My boss finishes his coaching call and offers to grab me lunch at our local health food market. I brought leftovers, but a wrap sounds much more delicious, so I agree. He leaves and I head across the hall. My friend who rents the other part of the building runs a spa, and I get my underarms waxed by her. I have been seeing her for eight years now and I will NEVER go back to shaving. She charges me half price for waxing, and in exchange, ​I proofread and edit all her promotional materials. $15 12:30 p.m. — Boss gets back with my turkey bacon wrap and we eat lunch together. He treats (as always) and we talk about business and where things are going with the other company he runs. He jumps back on a call and I work on cleaning and organizing a filing cabinet. 3 p.m. — Finally wrap up and head home, where I relax with a snack and my iPad until my husband gets home from work. Since my husband's job is changing and he and all his employees are about to start working from home, they won't be part of his team anymore. He is taking them to see a movie for one last team-building exercise on Friday but because of budget cuts, ​his company won't reimburse him and this one is on us. We pay in advance and get a slight discount since he has points from going to the movies so often. $52.77 6 p.m. — My husband and I meet my mom and her husband for a double date. Our dinner is included in the cost of a ticket (which we bought last month), but they charge me $2 for a Diet Coke (!!). We eat and watch and tip our waitress $25 afterward. We have an absolute blast and agree to go back to see a couple more shows with them. $27 Daily Total: $94.77",6,58
"6:45 a.m. — My alarm goes off and I grab a bagel and a Diet Coke. I have to be at my new client's house by 8 a.m​. Luckily, she lives about 10 minutes away, so I do a few bits of vacation rental work and then get ready. 8:45 a.m. — I pack my laptop, a snack, and a Diet Coke, and rush out of the house. I grab the dog to drop her off at daycare on the way. When we moved into our new house, she started chewing holes in the drywall while we were at work, so we started putting her in daycare three days a week and I negotiated with my bosses to work from home two days a week (instead of getting a yearly performance raise). Now that I work from home all the time, she technically doesn't need to go to daycare, but I still like her to get the socialization and exercise. 12 p.m. — I finish up with my new client. She's not even sure what she needs but I helped her through some stuff and we agree that I will start bookkeeping for her so she can focus on other parts of the business. My husband is at the dentist for an annual cleaning ($40) and he picks up a smoothie on the way home ($6.20). Doesn't even offer to get me one, the nerve! $46.20 1 p.m. — My husband tells me he's leaving to go to the spa. A friend ran a flash sale recently and I got him an hour-and-a-half massage, so he's going to use it now because his shoulder is tight. (He tips $25.) Right as he is leaving, my mother calls me to see if I want to go to lunch. I throw chicken in the Crock-Pot for dinner and head out. We meet at a sandwich shop where I order two small Parisian sliders and she has a Reuben​. (Her treat.) We talk about my sister and her future and then discuss my mom's upcoming vacations. As I'm leaving, my boss calls to discuss taking on a new property and whether it's worth it. We decide it's not. $25 2:30 p.m. — I get home and do a bunch more work. I can't figure out why one of our condos is renting like mad and another in the same complex with the same view is getting nothing. I look at comps and decide to lower the nightly rate a little bit. Maybe we'll get more interest. Afterward, I clean up the kitchen a little bit and clean out my car for my oil change tomorrow. 4:30 p.m. — I take the chicken out and shred it. There are so many delicious lemony-pepper juices at the bottom of the Crock-Pot​ that I don't want to go to waste so I add flour in thicken it and then throw the chicken back in. I'll start the rice and broccoli shortly. I also check our bank account and notice HP withdrew our monthly instant ink subscription. I need to talk to my husband because now that I'm not printing much at home for work, I'm not sure this expense is worth it. 5:30 p.m. — I sauté broccoli and make rice, and we eat while watching . I'm sure my husband is so sick of this show, but I love it and it's a mindless 30-minute program. Just as we're finishing, the guys show up to measure the back doors for replacement. They tell us it will be easy and not custom work, so hopefully, it'll be a reasonable price. 7:30 p.m. — My sister comes over and we watch TV while finishing up her craft project. She leaves and my husband and I crawl into bed early because he isn't feeling well. I read the news before going to bed. Daily Total: $71.20",7,58
"5:40 a.m. — Wake up and make breakfast: coffee, oatmeal, and a handful of mixed berries. Get ready for work. I usually walk 25 minutes to the hospital where I work, although today I take advantage of the 50% public transportation discount my employer offers. 2:15 p.m. — I finally sit down for my 3o-minute lunch break. I eat the salad I brought from home  (spinach, kale, salmon, avocado, tomato, and cucumbers — my cheaper version of Sweetgreen's OMG Omega salad). I also remember to contribute $20 toward a coworker's baby shower gift – the whole floor is going in on a stroller for her. $20 7:45 p.m. — Heading home from work! I have no motivation to cook dinner when I get home, so I order a sabich sandwich to pick up on my walk. I get home, shower, and eat dinner. It's Friday night and some of my friends are trying to convince me to go out. I decline and invite my boyfriend over instead. (He only lives a few streets over.) He brings beers, I make popcorn, and we watch TV for a few hours. We call it a night around midnight. $8.91 Daily Total: $28.91",1,59
"9 a.m. — My boyfriend was up and out early to get to a CrossFit workout. That's not my jam, but I do make myself a smoothie (kale, banana, frozen mango, and water) and leave for the gym 10 minutes away for a workout (30 minutes on the bike and a 30-minute full body circuit). On my way back I stop by the weekly produce market in my neighborhood. It's all “old” stuff from various grocery stores, but it's super cheap. I buy three bell peppers, two avocados, a handful of green beans, strawberries, blackberries, raspberries, and blueberries. I would easily pay triple that at the grocery store, especially for the berries. They sometimes go bad quickly, but I typically freeze the excess to use in smoothies. I also pick up a coffee on my way home. $14.62 12:45 p.m. — My friends pick me up and we go for a lunch of fish tacos and tequila. Afterward, we go shopping. I've been looking for a gift for my mom's birthday to go along with a scrapbook I made for her with photos of the traveling we've done together. I can't find anything, so I settle on treating her to lunch when she visits tomorrow. $31.06 6 p.m. — I'm babysitting tonight — my fun version of a Saturday night! Living in Boston is expensive, I don't make a lot of money at my job, and I'm starting full-time grad school soon, so every penny counts! Plus this baby is an absolute cutie and the parents are great. I put the baby to bed and start a book – by John Irving. It was on sale for $7 at my local bookstore. The parents offer to give me $20 to order in food, but that feels a little too generous to me, so I snack on an RXBar I brought from home and peruse their fridge. I settle on veggies dipped in hummus. They get home around midnight and insist on calling me an Uber home. They Venmo me $100 for the night. I usually keep most of my babysitting money in Venmo and use it to pay my roommate for my half of the utility bills each month. Daily Total: $45.68",2,59
"8:30 a.m. — Wake up and consider going to the gym, but then decide to do a quick yoga video and core workout with my roommate in our living room, which takes serious furniture rearranging. Afterward, I take a shower and make a hearty breakfast: coffee, a sandwich with a fried egg, mashed avocado, cheddar cheese, a slice of tomato, and a handful of berries. 12 p.m. — My mom and sister arrive! Yesterday was my mom's birthday, so we plan on taking her out to lunch. Before we leave, I put two trash bags' worth of old clothes in my mom's car for her to drop off at a donation bin. I couldn't find any place within walking distance of my apartment, so my mom is kindly doing it for me. My sister and I treat our mom to brunch at one of our favorite spots. Then we go shopping and take a nice long walk back to my mom's car, stopping for gelato at Eataly on the way! $56.12 6 p.m. — I get home and relax for a bit. I try to stay caught up with the news and this year for Christmas, my dad gifted me a yearlong subscription to . I read the news for a bit until it's time to get ready to go out. It's Sunday but tomorrow is a holiday, so although I still have to work, I don't have to be there until 3. Most of my friends have the holiday off and we've planned a fun night tonight! 8:15 p.m. — I meet up with my boyfriend and he calls an Uber. We are meeting two of our friends at a big bowling alley and bar. I pay for my bowling shoes and two games ($21), and the boys cover apps and beers. After two competitive rounds of bowling, my friend and I split the cost of a pitcher of Moscow Mules that we share with everyone ($18.50). My boyfriend pays for an Uber back to his place, where I spend the night. $39.50 Daily Total: $95.62",3,59
"8:30 — Wake up. My boyfriend and I both want to work out but we belong to different gyms. We drop by my apartment so I can change and then we hit up a casual breakfast place for coffee and egg sandwiches. My BF offers to pay, but I insist on at least splitting the bill, so I pay $8.50. (He makes more money than I do, but I like to pay some of the time.) We then head off to our separate gyms. $8.50 11:30 a.m. — I get my workout in and take a quick shower at the gym before going to the Whole Foods around the corner. I tend to alternate between Whole Foods, Roche Bros. (near my work), and Trader Joe's (more out of the way, but they have a lot of stuff you can't get anywhere else, so I go every couple of weeks). Today I'm picking up stuff mainly for work lunches and easy dinners. I still have most of the produce from the market on Saturday so that helps keep the cost of this trip down. I get a spinach-kale mix, chicken breast, frozen blackened salmon, baba ganoush, cherry tomatoes, soy coffee creamer, frozen mango, bananas, fresh mozzarella, rolled oats, and chocolate covered pretzels ($54.76). I stop at CVS on the walk back to my apartment for toilet paper (I have a $2 off coupon) and also grab a half-off bag of M&Ms ($7.98). $62.74 3 p.m. — Get to work; I'll be working from 3 p.m. until 11 this evening. I work a rotating schedule, which means days, evenings, overnights, weekends, and holidays. I do two 12-hour shifts and two eight-hour shifts per week and regularly pick up overtime. Although it makes for a wacky schedule between the off-shift differentials and occasional overtime, I'm able to make more money than my base. Tonight is fairly busy but uneventful. I eat pesto chicken that I made earlier today with a tomato-mozzarella salad for dinner. Daily Total: $71.24",4,59
"9 a.m. — I'm having a lazy morning in bed but I finally get up, make a smoothie (spinach, kale, banana, frozen mango, and water). I watch the news while I have my breakfast and then take a quick shower and get ready for work. 10:15 a.m. — Grab the lunch I made yesterday plus some snacks (bell pepper, baba ganoush, and chocolate covered pretzels) and begin my walk to work. One of my coworkers texts me and asks if I can grab her a cup of coffee on my way in. I gladly do so and get a latte for myself – triple shot, as I suspect today will be a long day. I tell my friend I'll treat her to the coffee but she ends up Venmo-ing me, plus a little extra. Completely unnecessary, but I appreciate the gesture. $3.82 5:30 p.m. — Finally sit down to eat lunch. It's another busy day at work – lots of sick little babies with respiratory infections and the flu this time of year, in addition to all the other patients. Working with pediatric patients can be hard sometimes, but it's also so rewarding. I work as a nurse's aide, and although this wasn't the job I had in mind when I graduated college with a BS in molecular biology, it has been a great learning experience. I'm excited to take the next step in my career when I begin my master's program to become a physician assistant this summer. Daily Total: $3.82",5,59
"10:15 a.m. — I have another lazy morning in bed before getting up. I make coffee and an egg-avocado sandwich, which I eat with berries while watching TV. I also put a frozen fillet of salmon into the fridge so I can cook it tonight. I have a boot camp class at my gym at noon. (Classes are included in my membership fee.) On my way, I stop at TJ Maxx and pick up candles and a cute pair of PJs for my nephew – it's his birthday in a few weeks. I have a gift card, so I don't pay anything. 1:30 p.m. — Got my butt kicked at boot camp! I take a quick shower in the locker room and then head to a nearby café. Although I've already been accepted into grad school, I have one prerequisite class I must finish before I begin. I paid for the class out of pocket ($1,325), but my employer will reimburse 75% of that once I'm finished with it. It's been hard to find the time and motivation to finish the course, but it has to get done. I buy a coffee and a cup of soup, leave the change, and settle in to do homework. $9 6 p.m. — Get home and cook the blackened salmon that I had put in the fridge to thaw earlier. I make quinoa and chop up tomatoes and cucumber to go along with it. After I eat I put the extra away for tomorrow. 8:30 p.m. — Meet up with my boyfriend at a local restaurant. I get a glass of wine and we share a charcuterie board. He also orders a burger, since he hasn't had dinner yet. BF picks up the bill. We then head back to my place for another glass of wine, TV, and bed. Daily Total: $9",6,59
"8:15 a.m. — Wake up. Today is another day off! I'll be working this weekend to make up for it though. I make myself a smoothie and a cup of coffee before heading off to the gym. 11 a.m. — Workout and shower are done, so now off to babysit my little baby friend. It's unseasonably warm out, so after he wakes up from his nap, we go to my one of my favorite lunch spots. I alternate between eating my eggplant sandwich and feeding the baby his lunch from home. Afterward, we walk around the park before meeting his mom at the house. She Venmos me $80. $9.13 3 p.m. — After babysitting, I stop at a different café to do homework. I buy a cup of herbal tea in exchange for free Wi-Fi and an environment conducive to studying. $2.60 6:45 p.m. — Get home, eat the salmon and quinoa leftovers and am happy to see that I have enough left over for lunch at work tomorrow! I get out of work tomorrow at 3:30 p.m., so I'll have time to do more meal prep then. While I eat, I look online for a birthday gift for my nephew and I order a really beautiful set of wooden blocks. I love my nephew so much and being an aunt is so much fun! The blocks are pretty expensive, but they are a classic. He has lots of toys, so I try to focus on quality over quantity when giving him gifts. I use my dad's Amazon Prime to save on shipping. $43 Daily Total: $54.73",7,59
"7 a.m. — Wake up not feeling so hot. I take the dogs out and then my boyfriend feeds them while I get ready. I make bagels for both of us and grab a drink for myself from the fridge. BF puts his bagel on the coffee table for a minute — big mistake! His dog eats it in under 10 seconds and looks ashamed but delighted. I leave to the sound of my BF scolding the dog, but secretly I'm cracking up. 8:30 a.m. — I get to the office and make a hazelnut coffee. (My firm provides free soda, coffee, tea, etc.) I'm not usually a coffee drinker, but I hope the warm drink will make my aching throat feel better. I fill up my water bottle, water my plants, and settle in to get my day started. 10 a.m. — Check my account and notice I was charged for HelloFresh. We get deliveries on Mondays but our order frequency varies depending on our travel plans or if we have lots of social events in the upcoming week. I pay and then split with the BF. We're not very strict about things but try to be equitable and have never had an issue with who pays. He tends to pay more frequently when we go out for dinner and drinks, though. $59.94 11:30 a.m. — Go to lunch with a partner and another associate and we talk about projects we have coming up and how to handle work-life balance. I really admire this partner because she has a good balance and is kind and funny; she's been a real mentor to me. I order a sandwich with sweet potato fries and the partner pays for the three of us. 1:38 p.m. — Grab candy from our office candy jar. I worry about rotting my teeth out of my head, but it doesn't stop me. 3:10 p.m. — Take a Diet Coke and then stop to chat with a coworker for five minutes. I am hoping the soda and gossip will wake me up since I'm still not feeling well. 6:30 p.m. — Leave work and drive over to the BF's place. He owns his house and we usually stay there a few nights a week, at my place a few nights, and then separately at our own places for the remainder of the week. We make a pork noodle dish with kale from HelloFresh. It's a decent version of pho, but I miss the extra sauces and toppings I would get at a restaurant. I wash my hands because I cut up Thai peppers but evidently not thoroughly enough because I burn the crap out of my eyeballs when I take my contacts out. 9 p.m. — We binge-watch and BF makes us hot chocolate. Then we go to bed around 10:15, since I'm still not feeling great. Daily Total: $59.94",1,60
"6:40 a.m. — Alarm goes off; it's Friday! I lay in bed and pick out my next box from Le Tote. I get three to four boxes a month with four clothing items in each. I've only had a subscription for about three months and I'm torn about whether I want to keep it. I usually only like three of the four items and they aren't always the highest quality. On the other hand, I do save significantly on dry cleaning and don't have to worry about what to wear in the morning. I feed the dogs and let them out while my BF showers. He's going to drop off the dogs at my apartment on his way to work. We're staying there tonight because we're meeting friends out and I live close to the location. 7:40 a.m. — Have a granola bar and soda on the way into work. Call BF to see how traffic is since he left before me. He tells me my dog recognizes my voice over the Bluetooth and my heart melts. 10:40 a.m. — Wrap up the conference call, refill my water, and grab Advil from our office's medicine cabinet for my cramps. Booooo, cramps — but I'm happy that meds are available to help. 11:50 a.m. — A client catered lunch for our office today. I stack up Greek chicken, hummus, salad, pita chips, rice, and chocolate cake. 3:30 p.m. — Very stressful feedback meeting. I'm all sweaty afterward. Thank you for the betrayal, body. At least it's Friday! 5:50 p.m. — Meet BF and his coworkers at a local bar. I order three beers, a Diet Coke, and a falafel sandwich; he pays for everything. One of his coworkers makes a sexist comment to another coworker's girlfriend and she gets ticked off. I don't hear all of it but secretly fist pump when she stands up to him. 10:30 p.m. — We take an Uber home since we've been drinking. BF pays. We get home, walk the dogs, and go to sleep.

"8 a.m. — Wake up and check email. Lay around and read for a few hours. 10:15 a.m. — BF picks up breakfast for us from McDonald's. Guilty weekend pleasure. Sadly, my sausage and cheese McGriddle only has cheese. 1:30 p.m. — A friend takes us to get our cars from the bar. On the way home, I stop to fill up with gas because my tank is empty, empty, empty. $30.64 2 p.m. — BF orders pizza and we watch college basketball while I work. 4:30 p.m. — I drop BF off at a bar to meet his friends. They're doing a birthday bar crawl but sadly, I have to keep working. I buy a Diet Coke on the way back to keep me company and spend the next few hours working with on in the background. Good add, Netflix! I also put on a face mask my mom put in my Christmas stocking. It makes working a little more tolerable. $1.20 9:30 p.m. — I stop working, walk the dogs, shower, and get ready. Then I take an Uber to meet BF, his friends, and two of my friends. Wow, they are all really drunk and it is very entertaining from my totally sober perspective. $6.02 10:30 p.m. — I get two cheap beers with cash and tip a dollar each time. A member of the group buys a round of shots for everyone and we dance for a couple of hours. Around midnight, I tell my BF I need to go home because I have to work again on Sunday. He decides to turn in with me. $8 11:59 p.m. — We snag an Uber but BF gets distracted by a taco truck. His drunken antics are out of character and are cracking me up. Our Uber ride is $6.41, but I tip the driver an extra $10 in cash for waiting on my drunk/ridiculous partner and for putting up with his passionate declarations of love for the taco truck on the drive home. We get home, I steal half a taco, walk the dogs, and go to sleep. $16.41 Daily Total: $62.27",3,60
"8:10 a.m. — Wake up, take dogs out, and make myself a bagel, which I eat with raspberries and cranberry juice. Get back to work, sadly. This weekend I have to work an unusual amount because of a big project. 1 p.m. — Stop working, get packed up, and go volunteer. I buy a wrap and water on the way and eat in the car. I am working with individuals with disabilities to help prepare for an upcoming fundraiser. It's challenging work but I have a great time and start contemplating my ticking biological clock. I still think I want to have kids, but I know the risk of birth defects increases with the mother's age. I don't think there is an answer to this question for me right now, but it definitely gets my brain churning. $4.80 4:45 p.m. — Arrive at BF's house. He cleaned up my apartment for me and then brought the dogs over to his house because it is much closer to where I was volunteering. I grab a few crackers and then take a nap while he finishes watching a scary movie (a genre I'm not into). 6 p.m. — Wake up and keep working. We make a HelloFresh meal of chicken tacos and watch while I work. It's crazy how young all of these actors look! Also, Kevin Bacon was QUITE fit in the day. I laugh after noticing this. BF cleans up dinner, we get in bed and talk for 30 minutes, and then it's time to snooze! Daily Total: $4.80",4,60
"6:50 a.m. — After the usual routine, we drop my dog off at my apartment before going to work. 8:20 a.m. — Grab a Diet Coke from the work fridge, put in my headphones, and blast Chvrches. The deadline for the big project I worked on all weekend is today, so I am ready to power through the day. 10 a.m. — Get an email from Chewy billing me for dog food and supplies I have on auto-order. It's cheaper than picking up dog food locally. 1 p.m. — Eat leftover pho we made for dinner last week. It's still pretty tasty and I am digging soup with the cold weather. Work through lunch. 6:30 p.m. — Our project is done! I get home and take my dog for a leisurely stroll. I unpack this week's HelloFresh box, put everything in my fridge, and start doing laundry. 7:15 p.m. — I need groceries and run to the store to get a variety of snacks, breakfast food, and quick meals. $41.73 8 p.m. — I crash on the couch with mac and cheese, broccoli, and a beer. I catch up on T and watch the first season of  , which I am loving. Still, I get to thinking about how she shows her breasts (and is conventionally attractive and sexualized) and wonder if that was a requirement for people auditioning at her time. In some ways, she's clearly on track to be this powerful and successful woman, but there are also beauty norm issues here. 9:30 p.m. — I rent a dress from Rent the Runway for a fundraiser my BF and I are going to on Friday night. I feel a little guilty because I already own things I can wear, but I think, , and order the dress ($58.20). I also sign up again for RTR Pro ($15.25), because my subscription has expired. I rent dresses about four times per year so the shipping savings with Pro are worth it. $73.45 9:45 p.m. — Drink a second beer while watching TV, then walk the dog and crash by 10:15.

I take a piece of cake for the afternoon because I know it will all be gone by then. 11:30 a.m. — I take several people from a regional bank to lunch. It's a mix of business networking related to my job and trying to secure money for a fundraiser for a local nonprofit I am involved in. They agree to donate and I am thrilled — lunch is also delicious. I pay for everyone's meal but will be reimbursed by my company. ($71.10 expensed) 6:10 p.m. — Hit up the gym, which is a free perk of my job. I go about twice a week, although I always have the best of intentions of going more often. 7:30 p.m. — Make chili from HelloFresh, which is pretty tasty, and watch an episode of and one of . This episode isn't as bleak as others so I feel downright cheerful compared to how I usually feel after watching . Then I get a text from my ex, which, while cordial, makes me really sad. I cry in the shower for a few minutes because sometimes a good cry just makes you feel better. The text is nice — he wanted to check in on me and the dog and give me an update on his life — but it definitely leaves me feeling off. I talk to my BF about it a bit and go to bed.

"7 a.m. — It's a typical work morning. I take care of the dog and grab a bagel for my drive. Not having the weekend to recover from work has me longing for Friday, even though it's only Wednesday. 12:10 p.m. — I planned to eat leftovers for lunch today but my salad from yesterday had too much dressing and is yucky today. My pho is old and grossing me out, too. I go and order Jimmy John's, which arrives in less than 20 minutes. I am embarrassingly excited about my ""Vito"" sub and salt and vinegar chips. I'll have to avoid breathing on anyone for the rest of the day. $12.40 2:30 p.m. — A coworker and I have cabin fever and decide to walk and get a snack. I pick up peanut M&Ms from a sundry shop around the corner. $1 5:45 p.m. — I meet a friend who is also involved in the nonprofit I am fundraising for to discuss marketing for an upcoming event. We meet at a local pizza place and order beers and a pizza to split. It has braised lamb, roasted tomatoes and onions, arugula, queso fresco, and southwestern seasoning, and is good. We split the bill. $21.20 7 p.m. — I swing by the drugstore and pick up a cheap bottle of wine on the way home. $11.80 8 p.m. — I veg out again with my dog, take him for a walk, drink a glass of wine, and watch . I get in bed and call the BF to catch up on our days, and then conk out. Daily Total: $46.40",7,60
"6 a.m. — I am awake too early thanks to the cacophony of steam hissing from my radiator. If I forget to turn it off at night, it automatically comes on at times set by the building. I listen to a podcast to try to fall back asleep. 8:30 a.m. — I'm up. I'm up! Open the blinds. Make the bed. Get ready while listening to another podcast. I check email and Twitter (my favorite), respond to a Hinge message confirming a wine date tonight, and leave in time to walk to work. 9:55 a.m. — I am running because of my hair, so I request an UberPool to get to work by 10:10. I am the last one picked up but the first one dropped up, so I proclaim it must be my lucky day while exiting the vehicle. Everyone probably hates me. (I get a $1 rebate on Uber rides by using an app called Ibotta. Once you have $20 in your account, you can request payment via Venmo.) $4.65 11:30 a.m. — Take a trip to the work kitchen for snacks. We have free coffee, tea, sodas, LaCroix, other fizzy drinks, small snacks, fruit, and candy at our disposal. Hot cocoa with almond milk sounds good for some reason, though I usually have tea. I also grab a handful of fancy mixed nuts. 12 p.m. — Book a Zipcar for a meeting I have in another city tomorrow night. I live a stone's throw from downtown SF and don't have my own car. Thankfully, our company has a Zipcar account that employees can use for offsite work meetings. ($121.52 expensed) 1:30 p.m. — Lunchtime. I buy a cup of tomato bisque and a side salad from one of the lunch places downstairs. I run into a colleague and we go back to the office to eat in the kitchen. She shares a funny story about one of her little kids. I genuinely enjoy hearing about her kiddos; they sound like real hams. $10.63 4:30 p.m. — In the kitchen again for a pomegranate Hint Water and something sweet. We have Halloween-sized boxes of Nerds in the candy drawer and I can't resist. I still need to power through a few more emails before the day is over, but I remember I have a few items in my Target shopping cart and it's payday, so I purchase them through Ibotta. I get polka dot midi dress ($26.39), a copper soup ladle ($5.09), and four melamine dinner plates ($15.65). Make a note in Todoist of the expected delivery date. $47.13 6:15 p.m. — Leave work a bit late and hop on the bus ($2.50) to meet a friend at my place to brainstorm ideas for a web series or podcast. We are both trying our hands at stand-up comedy but aren't sure that's the lane we want to pursue. Stop by the little grocery store right across the street from my apartment to pick up baked potato fixings for dinner. I don't know if my friend is hungry but I get enough for two just in case. A couple of hours later, my friend leaves and I wolf down my potato and get ready for this date. $11.17 9 p.m. — Meet up with Hinge guy at a wine bar he picked in my neighborhood. Two and a half hours and a bottle of wine later (which he paid for), he walks me home as it starts to rain. We have a great time and he texts immediately to see if I can get dinner soon. 12:22 a.m. — I shower at night to wind down and take off the day before bed. Daily Total: $73.58",1,61
"7 a.m. — I am awake and not feeling too hot (thank you, wine). I chug a Hint Water and lie awake for a while. I have a presentation at 7:30 tonight at a meeting about one of our projects, so I give my boss a heads up that I'll be working from home this morning to prepare for the late evening; she understands. 10 a.m. — I check the Chase app as I'm going over my budget and see my state tax refund has already hit. I got my taxes prepared last week and my accountant said to expect the refund in about a month, so I'm impressed (for once) with CA government! My goal every year is just to not owe. I email my accountant to see if he received my check for the tax prep fees. I also send him my pay stub; he said he would look at it to determine if I should adjust my withholding due to the new tax legislation. 11:30 a.m. — I am starving and decide to make home fries with the other potato from last night. I put them in the oven while I shower hoping the water and the food will make me feel better. I need to get it together if I want to be ready for tonight. 1:30 p.m. — Get to the office and follow up on a few things before getting ready to leave for another meeting about an hour away. I'm involved in a fundraising breakfast next week, so I am meeting with the executive director to talk about my speech. I drink a warm Coke from the supply closet, hoping it will help settle my stomach and head. 2:30 p.m. — Grab chicken noodle soup from the place downstairs and eat it in the work kitchen while reading Forbes for a few minutes. I learn the CEO of Patreon is 33. $7.33 4:30 p.m. — Arrive at a wine bar for the meeting. I had enough wine last night, so I go for three glasses of mineral water. Yes, keep them coming. We share chips, nuts, and olives. I am finally feeling better. She pays. 6:30 p.m. — Arrive at the next meeting and drink a glass of wine while waiting to present. I thought there were going to be appetizers, but there aren't any. After chatting for an hour longer than I anticipated after the presentation, we finally head out. My colleague pays for the wine. 9:30 p.m. — It's a 45-minute drive back to the city in the rain, but I always book nicer Zipcars when I have to drive at night for work meetings. I usually get a BMW X3 but there were none available, so I picked the 328i. It's zippy and has great handling and visibility. I blast Jessie Ware's new album on the way and decide I can never go back to non-luxury class if I own another car someday. Uber home from the Zipcar garage near work. ($15.83 expensed) 11:30 p.m. — Shower, exfoliate, and catch up on in bed while drinking Nighty Night tea with my doTerra lavender oil wafting out of the diffuser. I am praying for a good night's rest. Daily Total: $7.33",2,61
"8 a.m. — I think my alarm has been going off for 15 minutes. I snooze it for another 30 but eventually wake up and check email, Twitter, Instagram, and dating apps. Decide I should probably delete Instagram again. It kinda makes me unhappy. 8:30 a.m. — Start getting ready and am out to door to catch the bus to my 10 a.m. dentist appointment. I am picking up my night guard; $500 to prevent teeth grinding. I paid for it on my last visit with my HSA card. $2.50 11 a.m. — At the office for a conference call. One of the higher-ups brings in pastries every Friday. They are usually gone by this hour, but the universe is smiling upon me and I snag half of a cinnamon bun. I make Earl Grey tea with a splash of almond milk and grab a pomegranate Hint Water. 12 p.m. — Head to a monthly lunch with a few coworkers and we have dim sum to celebrate Chinese New Year. On the menu are pork buns, shrimp dumplings, Chinese broccoli, cabbage salad, and green tea. My colleague pays. 2 p.m. — Another conference call about one of our projects. I have a few people to catch up with around the office this afternoon and get the okay from one of my bosses about our new website design. 4 p.m. — Hinge guy texts, asking if I'm still up for something later. He suggests dinner and movie and recommends a restaurant and . I love a man with a plan. Agree to meet at 8 for dinner before the movie at 9:15. 6 p.m. — It's pouring outside, so I catch the bus home to get ready. $2.50 7:40 p.m. — Uber to meet Hinge date at a taco restaurant in the Mission. There's a 30-minute wait so he's at the bar next door. He already drinking a michelada, so I order a margarita. I am ravenous at this stage and trying to hide my hanger (hunger/anger). It's 8:30 and they still don't have a table, so ditch them for counter-service tacos up the street in order to make it to the movie on time. He pays for the drinks and movie tickets so I get the grub. A burrito for him and carne asada taco plate for me. $26 11:30 p.m. — The movie is finally over. It was good but we both agree it was about 30 minutes too long. We go to a bar across the street to escape the theater's long bathroom line. I am ready to go home at this point but nature calls. He buys me a whiskey soda and 90 minutes later we take off. Uber home. $4.52 Daily Total: $35.52",3,61
"9 a.m. — Awake after a rough night of sleep with the new night guard. I woke up in the middle of the night to take the sucker out. Check the socials and Bumble, and catch last night's . I read his book recently and have since become a stan. Throw on last night's jeans and pop over to my local café for a green smoothie — it's one of my weekend rituals. I run into my neighbor on the way and offer to bring him one back, my treat. $12.66 12 p.m. — I sign up for Le Tote with a link for a free month from Facebook. My wardrobe is 99% black and I've been feeling an intense need to mix it up lately. Catch up with a couple of friends over the phone before I realize it's 2 p.m. and I haven't eaten or done anything productive. 3 p.m. — Leave the house to run a couple of errands but stop at Boudin first for a cup of clam chowder and a Caesar salad ($10.14). It's freezing out. Next up is the frame shop to get a frame for a new painting that just arrived in the mail. I buy the basic 18"" x 24"" frame ($45.10) for now. (I had a smaller piece custom framed a couple months ago and it wasn't cheap.) Take the bus home ($2.50). $57.74 7 p.m. — Text a few friends to see what they are up to tonight but nothing sounds compelling enough to leave the house. Decide to catch up on Oscar-nominated movies while chatting with my movie crew on Slack. I rent on Prime Video and watch on Netflix. $4.99 11 p.m. — Lights out. Daily Total: $75.39",4,61
"9 a.m. — It is a Do Nothing day – a.k.a. I have no set agenda and will see where the day takes me. I live for me time. I go the market across the street for milk and eggs to make pancakes and also buy orange juice, sparkling water, a can of minestrone soup, and a box of spinach. $20 12 p.m. — Watch a few episodes of before starting Dan Harris's book, . My mom's been telling me to meditate for years, and it's become a bit of a broken headlight for me. I keep seeing signs pointing to meditation. 3 p.m. — I contemplate going to SFMOMA and the new Everlane store that's opening this weekend, but ultimately decide to avoid the crowds. I rearrange art around my apartment and tidy up instead. 5 p.m. — Book a Zipcar for a work trip tomorrow and chat with a few Bumble matches. I go back and forth about online dating. It feels like such a time suck sometimes. ($85 expensed) 7 p.m. — I'm texting with a friend about the dynamic of our group of close friends and the various issues everyone is struggling with. I prefer not to discuss things this deep over text, but this is her style, so I oblige. I have to get ready for bed soon since I have an abnormally early call time tomorrow. I wash my hair with Obliphica Seaberry shampoo and deep condition it with a Kérastase mask. I do my nails while the mask sits, one of my weekly rituals. Daily Total: $20",5,61
"6 a.m. — It's still dark out but I'm up and ready for a work field trip to the State Capitol. We are taking a tour, meeting with representatives, and then attending a lunch panel on lobbying. I walk two blocks up SF's famous hills to pick up the Zipcar. 7:35 a.m. — I miss the tour bus because it left promptly at 7:30 a.m. like the email said it would. Bay Area traffic is the worst. Drive up on my own instead and end up arriving before the bus does. All's well that ends well, but I also missed coffee and bagels. 10: 30 a.m. — Our tour of the Capitol begins and we learn fun facts from our guide who clearly enjoys his job. We have a Q&A with our local reps, but I am dying of thirst and only thinking about lunch at this point. 12 p.m. — Lunch! Everyone is served the same dry sandwiches accompanied by a small bowl of fruit. I clean my plate while chugging two glasses of ice water and a cup of coffee; I pray for dessert and chocolate cake with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and berries arrives; there is a god! The lobbyist panel is interesting and we learn about their work and the pressing bills this legislative cycle — affordable housing, homelessness, transportation, and sexual harassment are on the agenda. 2:30 p.m. — Field trip is over and I text a friend in the area. We meet for a quick catch-up at Starbucks and I get a hazelnut latte with coconut milk. She pays. 6 p.m. — I make surprisingly good time on the drive back to the city. I start laundry, reply to texts I've been neglecting, and catch up on work emails. 8 p.m. — I do not feel like cooking even though I know I should. I keep a few cans of Cuban-style black beans from Trader Joe's on hand. Pair the beans with brown rice and top with sour cream and Tapatío, plus a side of sautéed spinach. It does the trick. 10 p.m. — Shower, pat on La Mer eye cream, and apply The Ordinary Alpha Arbutin 2% + HA and watch a few more episodes of with my night guard in. It has taken some getting used to. I remember today is the last day for a 10% discount on an eight-week performance class I want to take, so I register online. $350 Daily Total: $350",6,61
"8 a.m. — I'm awake for an hour before I start getting ready and check email. Look at my MealPal app to see if there's anything appealing for lunch today; there isn't. I am meeting podcast friends for coffee at 1 p.m., which is kind of throwing off my lunch hour today. 9:30 a.m. — Walk to the office and things are busy due to my being offsite yesterday. 12:30 p.m. — Meet my internet friends at a café designed for people who love Instagram and have a lot of expendable income. I order a Cobb salad at the counter and stick with water. We have a good conversation and they ask me to be on a future episode of their podcast. $21 3:15 p.m. — I've been back in the office for a while and am craving something sweet. We have mini-packs of Sour Patch Kids in the kitchen candy drawer, so I grab two and a blackberry Hint Water. Try to figure out how to prioritize everything that needs to get done in the next three hours. A friend is texting about a trip to NYC we are planning in June but I do not have the time to deal with that right now. 6:05 p.m. — I leave work and walk to Rent the Runway at Neiman Marcus in search of a dress to wear to the fundraiser in a couple days. I find an ugly but appropriate-for-the-occasion dress, but decline when they tell me it will be $200 to rent. (""It's Marni,"" the saleswoman says.) I go to Macy's where I find a Rachel Roy dress on sale and call it a day. It is something I can wear again. $95.11 8 p.m. — I run into my neighbor on the way home and stop at his taco shop for two veggie tacos with chips and salsa. I look at flights for Coachella and hotels for NYC and text my friends the prices. We plan to book everything in the morning. $11 10 p.m. — I'm exhausted. Shower, do my nightly routine and shut my eyes by 10:30 p.m. Daily Total: $127.11",7,61
"8:27 a.m. — I wake up slightly before my alarm is set to go off, which is the worst because there's not enough time to fall back asleep. I make my way over to the living room, turn on the TV to , and make a yogurt parfait for breakfast with Trader Joe's French vanilla yogurt, frozen mixed berries, chia seeds, and homemade granola bars that I crumble up for added texture. Yum! Today I have an afternoon shift at work, so I take my time getting ready in the morning. 9:30 a.m. — It's a gorgeous sunny day! As I'm walking to work, I look at my phone to choose a podcast for my commute and realize I need to buy a new monthly train pass. I make sure to stop into the nearest T station to reload my Charlie Card and then head out to walk again. I feel so lucky to live in a city where transportation is relatively inexpensive. $84.50 9:40 a.m. — A couple of nights ago, I saw on Instagram that Dunkin' Donuts has three new Girl Scout cookie-flavored coffees! I. NEED. Moving from upstate New York to Massachusetts has suddenly turned me into a DD addict. Since I just want to try one of the new flavors and I don't actually need the caffeine, I order a small coconut caramel iced coffee with milk and no sugar. This may be my new go-to order for a long while! $2.34 11:45 a.m. — I work at a preschool that has an in-house chef who is amazing! I love her cooking, so I never bring my own lunch. The school administrators also encourage teachers to eat the school lunch with the children to model appropriate eating practices and to socialize with the class. Today's lunch is banana pancakes, corn, strawberry yogurt, and navel oranges. It's tasty, but I know that this vegetarian lunch won't fill me up. 2:30 p.m. — I recently learned that you can preorder cronuts from Dominique Ansel Bakery! I'm visiting my older brother who lives in New York next month, and while I visit often, I've never had a Cronut because of how quickly they sell out. I am shaking with excitement as I successfully put in my preorder for two. I text my brother to let him know it's done and he texts back asking why I didn't order the max number of Cronuts you can order, which is six. Sigh. $13 6:40 p.m. — Home at last! It's late and I'm starving. Luckily I have tons of leftover pasta carbonara that I made over the weekend. I quickly prepare a salad of organic mixed greens, cherry tomatoes, and a honey-balsamic dressing for a balanced meal. Dinner is ready in less than 10 minutes. After dinner, I wash the dishes, take a shower, and go to bed early. Daily Total: $99.84",1,62
"6:40 a.m. — I definitely did not get enough sleep last night and have to be at work by 7:30 for the opening shift. When I have an early morning, I only give myself enough time to get dressed, put on makeup, and walk to the bus stop. I hustle out the door with my homemade granola bar in hand and catch the bus with a few minutes to spare. I pay with my Charlie Card. 7:15 a.m. — I'm immediately on the hunt for coffee when I get off at my stop. The preschool I work at is affiliated with a well known university, so it's located right on their campus. I pop into one of the academic buildings that I know has a café inside and get an iced coffee with three pumps of caramel syrup and milk. The breakfast buffet has a bacon, egg, and cheese sandwich that looks bomb, but I resist the temptation. $2.30 11:45 a.m. — Lunch today is a good one: turkey Tex-Mex, stewed tomatoes, and pineapple. I'm very thankful that this preschool has a lunch program. 1:30 p.m. — There's a staff meeting today that I fail to get out of. (Only two out of four teachers in each classroom are required to attend.) The one bright side is that there is always a sweet treat at every meeting, and today there are Girl Scout cookies. I snag a couple of Thin Mints and shortbread cookies for myself and a couple more to bring back to my co-teachers. 3 p.m. — Since I'm out of work early, I go grocery shopping at Trader Joe's. It's a short 10-minute walk, and it's a lovely day. I have no idea what I'm in the mood to eat for the rest of the week, but I start with finding the basic foods I typically get: apples, cara cara oranges , a salad kit, tea, and frozen meals. I decide to make pizza this week. I have marinara sauce at home, so I grab a garlic and herb pizza dough, mozzarella cheese, onions, and chicken sausage. I'm happy with my purchase and even more happy that everything fits in my backpack without breaking my back. I wait about five minutes for the bus and then head home. $39.14 4:30 p.m. — While I unload my grocery haul, I check my phone for texts from my best friend so we can plan a time to chat. She still lives in New York, and I miss her terribly. Over the weekend, she took a road trip to D.C. to visit a mutual friend and I have to find out the juicy details! She just got home from driving for six hours and tells me she will call later tonight. 5:15 p.m. — I make spaghetti and meatballs for dinner with ingredients I already had in my pantry. I have lots of greens to make a simple salad – the same as yesterday. I plan on saving the pizza for the end of the week. 7:45 p.m. — My best friend finally calls me and I am happy to hear from her. I normally hate talking on the phone (I 100% prefer texting), but she is a great storyteller. We talk for just over two hours, and then I shower and plan an outfit for tomorrow. I get sidetracked when my roommate finally comes from work and I debrief her on my phone call. She'll be away on a trip until the weekend and I want to hang with her as much as I can tonight. I get to bed by midnight. Daily Total: $41.44",2,62
"8 a.m. — The sound of car horns jolts me awake. I can never fall back asleep once I'm up. I go to the living room and watch while I do my morning yoga stretches. I have a lot of time to kill before work, so I make Vietnamese coffee. When it's finished brewing, I stir in condensed milk and add ice cubes. I have a yogurt parfait too. 9:30 a.m. — I have an afternoon shift, so I walk to work, taking in the vitamin D while listening to a podcast. Luckily, the weather this week has been cool and sunny. 10 a.m. — There's still a half hour before my shift, but I always get to campus early and chill out in the building with the café. I run into a coworker who is writing her children's documentation. I just finished doing mine last week, and we talk about how stressful work has been. After our chat, we walk over to work together. 11:45 a.m. — Today's lunch: chicken fajitas, Mexican rice, corn, and apples. As expected, it's delicious! The toddlers love it too and we make sure to let the chef know. 2:30 p.m. — I'm never not hungry. While the toddlers are napping, a co-teacher and I look for ""second lunch"" in the fridge (a.k.a. leftover school lunches), but sadly the fridge is nearly empty. I settle for pita chips and cheese, and she gets cottage cheese and Wheat Thins from the pantry. 6 p.m. — My friends and I are going to the Syracuse vs. Boston College game tonight. We bought our tickets for $15, months in advance. The group that we are going with is all SU alums, so it's gonna be a good time. I got an email earlier this week for 50% Uber rides, so I take advantage and Uber and dinner to meet a few of the girls. $4.10 6:20 p.m. — One of the girls arrived early and got us a table before the dinner rush. The menu looks amazing. I order a burger ($18), and my friends order a black bean quinoa burger and a Buddha bowl. We haven't gotten together in weeks, and it's really nice to hang out. It makes me sad to think of how busy everyone's lives are. When dinner is over, we ask for separate checks, and my friend offers to Uber us to the liquor store to buy Bud Lights to bring to a pregame at someone's apartment. I brought my own Harpoon IPA. $18 8:30 p.m. — The pregame gives me a lot of social anxiety. There are 50 people and I probably only know 10 of them. My friends and I find room on a couch that's away from most of the action. I feel awkward, but after an hour, everyone is ready to go, so I call an Uber XL for my friends and me and we make our way to the game. GO ORANGE! $8.54 9:30 p.m. — Throughout the night, I run into old college friends that I had no idea would be at the game. We don't talk for too long, but I promise to text them and make plans for the weekend. 10:50 p.m. — I leave the game a little early since SU is losing. I order a Lyft using the promotional code that was advertised during the game, but the Lyft driver never shows up! Next I try Uber Pool, but they can't match me with a driver. Then I see a co-teacher and her boyfriend who coincidentally also were at the game, so I take the T with them to their apartment, where I finally get an Uber home. $5.18 12:06 a.m. — Time for bed. Daily Total: $35.82",3,62
"8:40 a.m. — I didn't end up falling asleep until 1:30 a.m. and kept waking up throughout the night. I'm exhausted, but I make the effort to get out of bed. I stretch, watch TV, and make myself a yogurt parfait. I'm a creature of habit – my routine is the same everyday. 9:40 a.m. — I need a pick-me-up from DD. Today I try the peanut butter cookie iced coffee with milk. I also get my coworker (from last night) a brownie batter donut as a thank you gift and a box of 10 munchkins to bring to my co-teachers. The cashier is new and feels bad for holding up the line, so he gives me two extra munchkins for the trouble! Our toddlers are a great group of kids, but they are a handful, especially with the stomach virus running rampant throughout the center, so these donuts will be a good boost for morale. $6.06 9:45 a.m. — I have two offers on a Madewell cardholder that I'm selling through Poshmark. I bought the cardholder around Christmas last year, but sadly didn't love it as much as my old one. I go to CVS to buy a small bubble envelope since I anticipate that I will sell this soon. $1.46 11:45 a.m. — Lunch today is tortellini with turkey meat sauce, steamed carrots, and bananas. Delish! 1:45 p.m. — The toddlers are finally napping, and my co-teachers and I demolish the donut holes in just a couple of minutes. 6:30 p.m. — I go out for ramen with two of my work friends. We all work in different classrooms so we don't usually see each other during the work week, unless it's by a chance encounter. We vent to each other about work stuff and catch everyone up on our lives. When the bill comes, I use my card to pay and the girls Venmo me their portions. Miso ramen was the right choice on this cold night. $22 7:45 p.m. — As we leave the restaurant, I'm still hungry and remember there's a crepe place close by. No one objects to going. (I love my friends.) We each order a crepe. I get strawberry, kiwi, and honey in mine, and they order raspberry, lemon and Nutella, and coconut, Nutella, and strawberry, respectively. We each eat a third of our crepe and then pass it around, which is probably my new favorite way of sharing food. The consensus was that the raspberry, lemon and Nutella crepe was the best one. $8 9 p.m. — I'm having so much fun hanging out with my friends that I'm sad the night has to end. It feels like the weekend and I almost forget I have work tomorrow. I take the T home. 9:25 p.m. — Shower and then end my night by scrolling through Reddit while watching until I fall asleep. Daily Total: $37.52",4,62
"6:55 a.m. — I wake up to a massive rain storm. There's a nor'easter in Boston and flooding along the coastal areas is expected. I slowly get dressed, put makeup on, brush my teeth, etc. I still have a few granola bars left, which will be my breakfast for today. I look out my balcony window to witness how bad the storm is, and also to people watch for a few minutes before I catch the bus. 8 a.m. — I make it onto campus and walk the five minutes to work. The rain is unreal. 11:40 a.m. — Today's lunch is cheese quesadilla, red peppers, and plums. Not my fave. 3:30 p.m. — I'm out of work and my weekend can finally begin! The rain and wind are much heavier now than they were this morning. I run to the bus stop. I get a good Snapchat video of the rain for my friends and family in New York, where there is snow (which I prefer over rain) today. 4 p.m. — I made a grand exit off the bus when someone pushed me towards a fire hydrant as they were trying to board. I take off my leggings immediately when I'm home to inspect a nasty gash on my right leg. Greaaat. I'm bleeding a little and unfortunately don't have the right bandages for the job, but I have small ones. I'll have to make the trip to Walgreens tomorrow for more. 6:30 p.m. — I veg out for a couple of hours on my couch watching YouTube before I build up the energy to be productive. I haven't vacuumed my apartment in over a week, so I get cleaning, and then prepare dinner. I make spaghetti with tomato sauce again and using my salad kit from Trader Joe's. I feel too lazy to cook anything more complex than that. I settle in to eat and watch an episode of that I missed this week. 8:30 p.m. — I texted my friend earlier to ask if she could talk on the phone, and she was more than happy to. She is another friend of mine who lives in New York. I curl my hair while she tells me about her week. We get really deep in our conversations, but she always knows when to switch up the topic and change the mood. After a solid hour, we hang up. 9:30 p.m. — I'm finally going to start watching tonight, after many recommendations from friends. I slice up an apple with cookie butter on the side, put on a sheet mask, and watch a couple of episodes. There's no better way I can think of to end a night. Daily Total: $0",5,62
"9:30 a.m. — I wake up at 7:30, which is too early for a Saturday, and I want to sleep for a few more hours, so I set my alarm for 9:30. When I wake up again, I check my phone and see a text from my friend who I'm going to see with. Tickets are almost sold out and I'm worried we won't get the time we want. 10 a.m. — I feel groggy and in need of coffee. I make my usual weekend breakfast: Vietnamese iced coffee and scrambled eggs with mozzarella cheese and everything bagel seasoning. I turn on , my new TV obsession. 10:30 a.m. — My friend texts me that she got us movie tickets! She Venmos me and I pay right away. $13 12:30 p.m. — My roommate is coming home from her vacation and she's bringing her boyfriend and his parents back to the apartment. I want to give them space and privacy, so I get ready for the day and walk to Harvard Square to go to CVS. I pick up Band-Aids, sour gummy worms, Sprite, and cranberry juice. I need candy for the movie and drinks to make a mixed drink when I go to a pregame later. $15.06 1 p.m. — Before I go home, I make a pit stop at one of my favorite bookstores. They have a basement with a lot of used books for a decent price. I'm looking for new books for my class because my co-teachers and I are getting tired of the books in our library. I choose . The kids have been loving lately, and I may selfishly want this one because the book cover is glittery and purple (my fave color). It's half the price of a new book. I'll bring in the receipt on Monday and my work will pay me back. ($5.50 expensed) 2 p.m. — I'm starving. I make a big pot of pasta again, most likely for the last time this week. 3 p.m. — I take an Uber to my friend's house in Medford and then she drives us to the movie theater. $5.58 6:30 p.m. — OMG is amazing! On our drive home, we can't stop talking about it. 7 p.m. — My roommate and her boyfriend are home when I get back from the movies. We talk for a few minutes, since we haven't seen each other all week, but I have to eat and then get ready to go out tonight with work friends. I reheat the pasta, blast the soundtrack on Spotify, and get dolled up. 8 p.m. — My friend lives all the way in the North End, and the easiest and quickest way for me to get there is Uber. I feel guilty for spending so much money on Ubers this week, which is very unusual for me. I make a mixed drink of tequila, Sprite, and cranberry juice to bring with me before I go. $7.30 8:33 p.m. — This is my first time seeing her apartment, and it's so freaking nice. Her rent is way too expensive for me to afford, but she gets what she pays for – location, location, location. I meet her friends and we have a low-key night. 10 p.m. — It's time to go out, and my friend calls the Uber. 11:30 p.m. — After an hour of waiting in the cold, we pay the $10 cover at the bar and rush inside. First order of business is coat check ($1). We pay and then head to the bar. I suggest we get a round a lemon drop shots. A girl I met at the pregame beelines to the bar and orders the shots as well as two Bud Lights for me and my coworker and a vodka ginger ale for herself. I Venmo her for the drinks. $25 1:30 a.m. — We're all feeling tired and ready to go home. The prices for Uber are crazy expensive at this hour, so I opt for Express Pool, which cuts down the cost a lot. I get home just before 2 a.m. and pass out. $6.97 Daily Total: $72.91",6,62
"9 a.m. — I take my time this morning and check Instagram, Snapchat, and Reddit before getting up. I go to the living room, where my roommate and her BF are, and we tell each other stories about our nights. 10 a.m. — I'm super dehydrated, so I get a tall glass of water and then make a cup of tea to have with yogurt for breakfast. I stay on the couch and read two chapters of . I bought this book last summer and it has taken me a long time to finish it, even though it's really good. 11:30 p.m. — Since, I don't have plans today, it's a good time to clean my apartment. During the week, my bedroom floor is covered with my clothes and shoes. I have a bad habit of throwing them on the floor instead of putting them in the hamper or back in the closet. I end my cleaning spree in the kitchen by washing dirty dishes from yesterday and scrubbing the counters until they're pristine. Cleaning the apartment makes me feel better. 12 p.m. — As I was cleaning my room, I thought about how many clothes I have in the closet. I'm running out of space and hangers and with spring approaching, it feels like the right time to clean out the closet. I pride myself on making this a biannual routine. I order a donation bag from thredUP. 1 p.m. — Last month I started watching on Neflix. It's still a mystery how that began, since it's not the usual type of show I would watch, but I'm really into it. I finish the rest of my salad for lunch and watch more episodes from the series. 5 p.m. — I only get through one episode before zonking out. I take a VERY long nap. I'm surprised by how tired I was! Then I take a shower. 6 p.m. — Dinner tonight is a frozen bibimbap bowl from Trader Joe's. I make a fried egg to go with it, which makes a huge difference. I watch another episode of during dinner. 8 p.m. — Before the end of the night, I make overnight oats for breakfast and choose an outfit for tomorrow. Daily Total: $0",7,62
"8 a.m. — My boyfriend, J., and I wake up after a fun night and have the perfect morning wake up ;). Then I drag him to the gym with me to go to a strength-training class at 9 a.m. I sneak him by the front desk so he doesn't have to pay the obnoxious guest fee. The class includes an ABSURD number of squats and presses, leaving us out of breath and looking at each other with ""OMFG"" faces. Future Instagram fitness models? Probably not. 11:30 a.m. — J. spends about half the week at my place since he still lives at home far out in Virginia but works in D.C. We go to the Giant near my place so he can get food to keep at my apartment. I pick up coconut milk, frozen corn, kale, and chickpeas for a recipe I'm making, plus a pack of seltzer to keep in the fridge. $10.95 12 p.m. — We get back and are starving! We both make eggs and then we move on to the real cooking: I whip up a kale, goat cheese, and corn chickpea cake, a batch of chili for the week, and a banana snack cake that turns green/blue because I use sunflower butter in it (though it still tastes great). J. makes a ton of French toast with a splash of Maker's Mark, which makes it so much better. We bump to J. Cole while we make a mess in the kitchen. 2 p.m. — We pack up the French toast and walk to a friend's apartment. After an intense game of Risk with my boyfriend and roommate last week, J. and I decided we need a game with more strategy and less luck. Our trivia group offered to teach us how to play Settlers of Catan, which we enthusiastically agreed to. We eat French toast and play for five hours straight. J. wins the first game and I win the next two, after lots of strategy and negotiations. (Can you tell we are competitive?) We have an absolute blast and plot when we can play next. 7:30 p.m. — We get back from our friend's place and J. is starving, so we walk to &pizza to get him food. A friend recommended we try it, and it doesn't disappoint! After walking in the cold, we are ready to bundle in for the night. I want to watch but can't find it for free, so we settle on after realizing neither of us has seen it. We hit the sheets around 11. Daily Total: $10.95",1,63
"8:30 a.m. — My alarm wakes us up. I try to keep to somewhat of a schedule on weekends for my sleep so that I don't have too rough of a transition going back to work on Monday. I throw in laundry and then scurry to the gym, happy that it's too early for all the bros to be there. I do some sprints while daydreaming about the food I'm going to eat today. 10 a.m. — J. is still at my place when I get back. I shower and get ready, and then we both help my roommate clean our place a bit. I'm very appreciative of the fact that my boyfriend helps out since he stays at my place so frequently. He's great about cleaning up after himself, chipping in, and bringing us wine/food/etc. I flip my laundry, make scrambled eggs, say goodbye, and then call a Lyft Line to take me Georgetown. $3.61 11 a.m. — I meet up with my amazing and lovely friend from work at M Street. We picked an awful day to explore Georgetown, since it's sleeting and about 30 degrees out, but we roll with it. We pop in and out of shops, wistfully dreaming of working for companies like Patagonia or Nike. Then we stop for tacos and talk about what we want to do with our lives and how we will find our purpose. We talk about this almost every day – we're less than a year into our jobs, but we both know we want to pursue careers that set our souls on fire instead of working in management consulting. $11.51 1:30 p.m. — We stop at Baked & Wired and both get cupcakes. We did Whole30 in January and have been looking forward to this for over a month now. She gets the unicorn one and I get a vegan Oreo. I leave half of the cake uneaten because it is so cake-y, but overall the cupcakes are WAY better than Georgetown Cupcakes. I've never understood why the line is always so dang long for those mediocre ultra-sweet cupcakes. $4.15 2 p.m. — Our last stop is TJ Maxx, my favorite store. My mother raised me as a Maxxinista, so I love to scout the store for good sales. I snag cashew butter ($5.99), mascara, and Anastasia concealer. Anastasia Beverly Hills is one of my favorite makeup brands, and it is so much cheaper when you don't buy it at Sephora! $15.30 3 p.m. — I call a Lyft Line home, and once again am the only person in the car – score! Once I get home, I meal prep: cauliflower, brussels sprouts, sweet potatoes, chicken, and spaghetti squash. I pack a few meals in Tupperware for the week, jam to Spotify, and prep for work. I also publish a post on my blog. I started blogging after graduation (before I started my job) and find that it's a great creative outlet for me and a fun side project, even if no one reads it except J. and a few friends that know about it. $3.51 5:30 p.m. — I pack up and head to my boyfriend's house, driving in a monsoon to get there. I call my mom on the way and we catch up, and then have a hardcore jam session to Cobra Starship. When I was in Warby Parker the other day one of their songs was playing, which reminded me how much I used to love them when I was 14. ""Guilty Pleasure"" is on repeat and I'm singing like I'm on , for better or worse. 6:30 p.m. — I snuggle with J.'s dog, a rescue we adopted in college. We eat lots of good food with J.'s family.

"6:45 a.m. — I wake up and roll out of bed, immediately putting on gym clothes. I use my apartment gym to avoid walking outside in the cold weather. At the gym, I do incline walking and a bit of running. I shower, make coffee, and get ready. I pop an IBS peppermint pill to help mitigate my impending stomachache along with my concoction of vitamins. At 8:20, I hop in my car and put on a podcast. Today's pick: , a long-time favorite of mine. There's a big car accident so it takes me a bit longer to get to site today. 8:50 a.m. — I pull up at the same time as my manager, which is great because I'm still waiting for a badge and need to be escorted in each day. I set up in our team room, catch up on news, and figure out what I need to do today. I add some items to my Amazon Subscribe & Save order, which is set to be delivered next week: coffee ($4.96), collagen peptides ($23.76), glutamine ($9.58), Rxbars ($19.95), and BCAAs ($18.01). I use collagen peptides and MCT oil in my coffee each morning. Collagen has made a huge difference for me – I notice it most clearly in my nail and hair growth. $76.26 11:30 a.m. — After a morning of meetings, I shimmy down to the break room to grab my food: tuna, lentil pasta, brussels sprouts, and cauliflower – random but really good. I do intermittent fasting, so this is my first meal of the day. I put my head down and go back to work until about 3:30, when I heat up chili I brought for lunch. 4:30 p.m. — I leave the client site to drive to our office for a training, parking nearby ($15 expensed). I pick up dinner from a fast casual place rather than eating my sad Tupperware dinner. I get chicken, brussels sprouts, broccoli, and sweet potatoes with a salsa verde. The rest of the night, I feel bad for buying dinner when I easily had food available. $11.55 7 p.m. — I sneak out of the training early after thinking about how much I would rather be home. I stop for gas and fill up two-thirds of my tank, following my Dad's advice to never let it get below a quarter tank when it's cold out. Once home, I eat banana cake, clean the kitchen and bathroom, and update my Excel budget. I get everything ready for work and then settle on the couch to watch . I've been mentally preparing all day but still manage to cry three times during the episode. I'm glad no one is around to see me bawling – sometimes a good cry is therapeutic, but I'd rather do it alone. Afterwards, I crawl into bed with my book ( by Anna Raverat), and then fall asleep at 9:15. $20 Daily Total: $107.81",3,63
"5:40 a.m. — I wake up to the lingering smell of lemongrass from my diffuser, which was a Christmas gift from my parents. I'm still undecided on whether it makes a difference. I putter around to get my gym clothes on and walk to the gym for a 6 a.m. class. 7 a.m. — Holy. Crap. I walked into the class thinking it was a typical strength training class, but boy was I wrong. It was essentially a combination of Zumba, running, squats, and jumping. For an hour. Everyone in the class seemed totally fine and I was in the corner huffing and puffing, my face bright red. We kept running and jumping and kicking; I didn't think it would end! It was great in an awful way. I'll probably drag myself there again next week. I walk home and notice the beautiful sunrise – one of the perks of getting up really early. 7:40 a.m. — I'm all ready for the day and have about 40 minutes before I need to get to work. Most mornings I am running around like a chicken with my head cut off to get to work on time, so this is a refreshing change of pace. Once I'm ready, I read more of and drink my coffee out of a mug instead of a travel container. I appreciate drinking coffee leisurely so much more now that I'm working full-time! I toss into my bag to read on the metro tonight – I like to read two books at once, weirdly. At 8:10, my roommate and I walk to the metro together, where we see my boyfriend and another friend of ours from work. We have a great catch up on the ride, debriefing about my roommate's new guy. I'm going to the office today instead of the client site, which rarely happens, but I love when it does. Our office has natural light, usually free food lying around, and free coffee. 8:35 a.m. — Join my team in our room and begin working on client materials for an upcoming offsite we're hosting. I take a break at 9:15 to go to a blind coffee taste test to help pick which coffee our company should use in the machines. The rest of the morning is filled with decks, conference calls, and strategy with the team. At 11:45, I find leftover food outside a conference room and snag eggs. I also eat my first food from home: spaghetti squash, chicken, and sautéed veggies. 1:45 p.m. — The rest of my team is in meetings, leaving my fellow analyst and me in our team room. We chat about life, project work, and consulting in general. Both of us feel like we are either going 100 miles an hour or doing nothing, with little in between. Neither of us knows if this is normal or not, so we text friends and ask their thoughts. We get mixed results back, which provides zero clarity for us. It's nice having someone on my team who is also going through the adjustment from college to working full-time. 3:30 p.m. — Our contracts are changing at work, so these past few weeks have been incredibly ambiguous and volatile. My team bonds over this with lots of jokes being cracked, which is nice. Today is a slow day: I spend most of the afternoon chatting with my team, reading personal finance articles (I dream of retiring absurdly early), and sending emails. I also up my 401(k) contribution to 6% from 3%; if it's too much I will change it back, but I want to give it a shot to save as much as I can. 5:30 p.m. — I metro into the city for dinner with a friend from work who I don't get to see much, reloading my card on the way ($10). We interned together a couple summers back, so it's always great to see her and catch up. My stomach feels super off, most likely from the beans in the chili I've been eating the past few days, so I order a kimchi bowl for good probiotics. Eating out always reminds me how much food I could buy at the grocery store for the same amount. However, for the good of friendship, I suck it up ($9.51)! After dinner, I pop over to Whole Foods to buy milk (3.49). I metro home, reading on my ride. $23 7:45 p.m. — Once home, my mom calls and we catch up while I unpack from the day and put on my PJs from Target. (They are seriously the best. They look like leisurewear but also PJs, with jogger bottoms as soft as a baby's butt.) My roommate and I catch up while we eat out of our respective jars of almond butter, talking about wanting to have partners who are equally as ambitious and goal-oriented as we are. I read more of while drinking some tea, and consider going to a 6 a.m. yoga class tomorrow. But my desire to sleep in wins. I go to bed at 9:30 p.m. Daily Total: $23",4,63
"6:45 a.m. — I refuse to snooze in the morning. I immediately hop out of bed and head to the gym after chugging water. (I drink an absurd amount, gotta keep my skin young and fresh!) Damn, my butt and back are sore from yesterday. I go to my apartment gym and do a simple workout so I don't have to walk through the hail. While there, my friend texts me about the weather delay. I run upstairs and check my work phone to see that there is a two-hour weather delay – heck yeah! I embrace the delay and work in my sweatpants. Before logging on for the day, I publish another blog post and read a few pages of . Finally, I update my one-line-a-day journal, which I'm on my fifth (!) year of. I highly recommend it, it's great for reflecting back on the past and remembering what you've been up to in life. 10 a.m. — My manager tells me that it's quiet onsite today so I can work from home the rest of the day if I want. I'm all for it! I make an apple cider vinegar tonic to drink while I work. 11:30 a.m. — It's very bleh outside, and I'm happy I can work from my apartment. I make veggies and eggs while reading over documents. Making eggs in the middle of a weekday is such a luxury these days, so I savor every bite. I read more personal finance articles and ponder what direction I should take with my own blog. Right now it's just word vomit of my life, from living in D.C. to wellness to personal finance. I have no idea what direction to take with it, so for now I'll just sit on it more and think. While eating lunch, I also shoot a message to the local trivia group to see about hosting – perhaps it'd be a fun thing to do once a week or so? We'll see! 1:15 p.m. — More phone calls and decks. (The consulting life!) I use my Chem-X to make pour over. In a moment of stupidity, I place a plastic container on the hot burner and the plastic melts on my stove. My apartment reeks of plastic, and I quickly clean it up to avoid lingering toxic smells in the apartment. D'oh. I have more calls, and find out that the work I've been doing for the past few weeks is essentially obsolete now. I've accepted that part of this job involves doing work that is often thrown out the window, but I don't always like that. I throw myself a two-minute pity party. 5:15 p.m. — Today is one of those days where I look up at the clock and the workday is almost over and my brain really hurts. I put on while finishing up emails and other random small tasks. Once again, I cry. A lot. is really just a free form of my own personal therapy. Once I finish up, I bake a banana snack cake (a Pamela Salzman recipe), make spaghetti squash, sauce, and chicken for dinner, and chat with my roommate about work and her upcoming birthday. J. shows up and we chat for a bit before walking to trivia, schlepping through the awful weather. 7 p.m. — We meet up with friends and commence our trivia effort! We are consistently inconsistent, and tonight we're pretty bad. It's still a ton of fun though and a great thing to look forward to on Hump Day. 9 p.m. — By round four we are seriously behind, so we all cut our losses and head out. When we get back, J. surprises me with Catan! I'm so pumped – I had looked into getting it but didn't want to spend the money. We make plans to teach my roommate this weekend after her birthday brunch. We have some fun time and then read in bed before going to sleep. Daily Total: $0",5,63
"6:45 a.m. — Up and at it again. I walk on the treadmill since I don't feel like an intense workout, but I love to move my body before work since I sit for so much of the day. I miss walking around a college campus all the time! On my commute I listen to episode with the founder of Siggi's. 9 a.m. — I find an empty cubicle and set up shop – I hate sitting in our team room all day because it's windowless and has bright fluorescent lights. If there is one thing I truly detest in life, it's fluorescent lights. I sit with the lights off near the window (such a luxury!), and work. Our team finds out that our contract is going to be funded, which is a huge sigh of relief – we thought we'd be losing half of our team. This means my fellow analyst will still be on the team with me, which I'm happy about! 11:15 a.m. — I heat up oatmeal for lunch, which I made with oats, egg whites (don't knock it 'til you try it – they make the oats so thick!), coconut milk, ashwagandha, maca, cinnamon, vanilla, and blueberries. I read Money Diaries and more personal finance articles while also thinking of what batch meals I want to make this weekend. 1:40 p.m. — My stomach is growling, but I'm on a conference call. A teammate sends me the link to the Avett Brothers concert at Wolf Trap this summer, and I immediately text my brother to see if he wants to come to town and go with me. At 2:15 I heat up spaghetti squash, chicken, and veggies. It's a quiet day here and I wish I could work from the comfort of my couch. 4:30 p.m. — I dip out because everyone of importance on my team isn't around. I call my mom on my drive home – I really miss seeing her on a regular basis and love talking to her pretty much every day. We're very close and I love having the ritual of calling her on my ride home. Once home, I take my last work call of the day. After eating cashew butter and banana cake, I go down to the gym and walk while finishing my book to get more steps and movement in. 6:15 p.m. — J. arrives and we have a heartfelt discussion. He's really committed to our future, and it's not that I'm not, but I feel so young to commit one way or another and don't want to make decisions now when I don't need to. I've talked before about wanting to leave D.C. and live in other cities while I'm young, which makes J. nervous. It's complicated, but we have a good discussion. After, we eat dinner (eggs, veggies, and tortillas with hot sauce) and then I succumb to a Hulu trial subscription. I've been wanting to rewatch and J. gives in and watches with me – we get through two episodes and he's hooked! While we watch, I do a watercolor painting. We climb into bed around 9:30 and read and unwind before going to sleep. Daily Total: $0",6,63
"6:45 a.m. — I wake up and head to the gym. After that I decide it's worth being a few minutes late to work to make J. a PB&J for him to take on his commute. 9 a.m. — On my way to work I listen to a new podcast I love called , which J. recommended to me. This episode features Gretchen Rubin, who I LOVE! I'm a personal development junkie so I love learning about habits, happiness, and human nature. 11:45 a.m. — Sitting in a windowless, fluorescent-lit room kills my spirit. Sigh. I eat tuna (not in the team room, to prevent smelling), and a medley of veggies for my first meal. 2 p.m. — I run out to get coffee for my manager and myself in an attempt to mitigate my headache. Sadly, it doesn't help, and now I'm stranded outside the building waiting for someone to come get me. My teammates are all in meetings/on calls, so I stand outside for about 20 minutes enjoying the sunshine and going through email. I drink my cold brew too quickly and get the shakes, UGH! This happens every time, and I never learn. Eventually, I am rescued. ($8.47 expensed) 3:30 p.m. — I have a pounding headache still. I give in and take Motrin, and then eat my desk lunch of spaghetti squash, chicken, and veggies. I'm still hungry so I eat a Larabar too. Can I go home yet? 6 p.m. — I get home from work with a bad headache, so I skip yoga and bake cupcakes for my roommate as a post-birthday brunch treat. I don't have muffin liners and the cakes get crumbly, so I turn the cake into cake balls, but realize I need butter for frosting. J. and a friend come over, and I offer to drive his friend home. I pick up butter, sprinkles, and eggs on my way back. $10.53 9:30 p.m. — J. and I split a Lyft to a housewarming party hosted by some of our college friends. It ends up being pretty lame, although I see a few people I haven't chatted with in a bit. We slip out after an hour or so and climb into bed right before midnight. $7.50 Daily Total: $18.03",7,63
"7:30 a.m. — I get out of bed and wash my face and dry shampoo my hair until I look presentable for work. Quickly cut potatoes and carrots to throw in the crockpot with a roast so I'll have dinner and food for this weekend. 10 a.m. — I've been working out of the office for the past few days, so my morning is spent powering through calls and emails and playing a bit of catch up. I eat my packed breakfast of plain Greek yogurt, blueberries, strawberries, and granola. 12 p.m. — I brought lunch from home today, but the cafeteria has Indian food catered and it smells SO good. I can't resist and end up buying an order of chicken tikka masala. $8.63 2 p.m. — I recently transitioned to a new team at work and none of them come in the office on Fridays, so I leave after a productive morning in the office to finish my day at home. On the way, I stop to get gas ($25.11) and a car wash ($11). $36.11 7 p.m. — After hitting the gym for a much-needed sweat, I eat some of the roast I had been cooking in the crockpot all day, telling myself to prep meals like this more often. It's so nice to come home to supper already cooked and it makes the house smell delicious. While eating, I visit with one of my roomies and her BF who is visiting for the weekend. 10 p.m. — I recently found out that my boyfriend of two years had been cheating on me. Seeing my roommate all happy and in love with her new BF has me feeling a little (okay, a lot) down in the dumps about my current situation. I go to my room and call my parents and finally tell them what happened between me and my now ex. It took a while for me to tell them, which may seem weird, but when it first happened, I was in so much shock and denial about it all. It's an emotionally draining conversation and it feels like I've ripped the Band-Aid off all over again, but I'm relieved my parents know now. They are my support system and I needed to lean on them. After pouring my heart out, my parents invite me on a weekend trip to the Caribbean they have planned and won't take no for an answer. My dad tells me to pick flights and he will the cover the cost ($503.67). Seriously, they are the best parents. 11:59 — After what feels like the world's longest day, I wish I could say I did yoga or meditated before bed. Instead, I ate a giant stack of Double Stuf Oreos, cried a bit, and watched Netflix until I fall asleep. Self-care comes in all different forms, right? Daily Total: $44.74",1,64
"7 a.m. — Awake despite desperately wanting to sleep in. I am a dog walker on the Wag! app, so I schedule a walk for 8 a.m. Dog walking gives me my puppy fix and extra cash I don't have to budget for! 9 a.m. — I finish the dog walk and head to the gym for weights and cardio. I'm channeling last night's emotions into today's workout and leave high on endorphins. I come home and down an iced coffee, a banana, and two hard-boiled eggs while deciding what to do with my day. 1:15 p.m. — My alma mater is in the Big Ten Conference and I see there is a Big Ten bar crawl around Fenway today. I text one of my friends in the area and we decide to go together. I grab a Lyft to meet her ($11.57). On the way, I go on my Amazon phone app and order a cozy giant blanket for my college roomie who lives in a different state now. She has been on the receiving end of so many late night emotional calls and texts from me this past month and I want her to know how much I love and appreciate her for that. I use points to cover some of it and only pay $13.57. $25.14 8 p.m. — The bar crawl is ending. My friend and I met some fun girls on the crawl and exchange numbers with them, promising to grab drinks soon. I carried cash to keep my spending on drinks and food to a limit instead of mindlessly putting everything on my card, but I still lost track of what I've had to drink so far. My friend and I Uber back to my neighborhood to meet my roomies and go out. She pays and I promise to buy a round at the next bar. $60 2:30 a.m. — Finally make it back home after spending the rest of the night at a local bar with live music. I spent the night dancing alone and actually loved it. I paid the cover and bought a round of drinks and a basket of fries for my friend and me. $30 Daily Total: $115.14",2,64
"9 a.m. — I'm up and surprisingly feeling great. I deep clean the apartment before I can change my mind and crawl back into bed. 10:30 a.m. — Ex texts me that he wants to meet for coffee. Despite the shit he did, I still love him, and as much as I wish I could control my feelings with a magical switch that turns on and off, I can't. 12 p.m. — Go to a bagel shop with my roomies for the first meal of the day and I'm starving. I get an asiago bagel with veggie cream cheese. All the dairy is going to make me bloat, but I need it. $4.57 2:30 p.m. — After weighing the pros and cons, I decide to meet my ex for coffee. I order jasmine tea and we chat for an hour about life. It's nice, but he hits me with an ""I still love you but I don't know if I'm in love with you."" Hearing that someone you care about so much doesn't feel the same way you do is one of the worst feelings ever. I call my mom and sister. I wish more than anything that I could drive home and curl up on the couch with them, but since I'm several states away, a phone call with have to suffice. $2.75 10 p.m. — I realize that the only thing I've eaten today is that bagel so I heat up leftover roast and throw on Netflix. Daily Total: $7.32",3,64
"5 a.m. — I'm up an hour before my gym alarm because I'm restless. I decide to get up and get there extra early, knowing I'll feel better after a solid sweat. 8:30 a.m. — Arrive at work and settle into my desk for morning meetings with a giant water and peanut butter banana protein shake. 12 p.m. — I have no appetite so I make green tea to sip on while browsing the internet during my lunch break. My roomies and I are planning a Galentine's Day party so I search Pinterest for decoration inspiration. 1 p.m. — Still no appetite but I know I need to put something in my stomach. I mosey to the cafeteria and buy buffalo popcorn chicken to munch on. $3.62 6 p.m. — Warm up the last of the leftover roast for dinner and wait for my roomies to come home. I have been sequestered away at my desk all day and feel like I've barely spoken to another human, so I'm excited for them to get home. 8 p.m. — My roomies and I catch up on our days and I feel so grateful for them, especially this last month. They have been so supportive of me through the breakup with my ex. I am hungry and feeling a little under the weather so I make a PB & J, chug a glass of Emergen-C, and go to bed early. Daily Total: $3.62",4,64
"5:15 a.m. — My alarm is set for 7:30 but my internal clock wakes me up. I consider going to the gym but I know sleep would be best to fight this head cold so force myself back to bed. 7:15 a.m. — Up for real this time. I check my sleep-tracking app and see that I slept nine and a half hours last night. Go me! I shower, drink a cup of coffee, and pack Greek yogurt with blueberries and strawberries to eat at my desk later for breakfast. I also pack clothes to work out in after work. One of the main reasons I chose to live in Massachusetts was to be near my (now ex) BF, and not having him as part of my daily routine anymore is so effing hard. Working out helps to keep my mind off of things, so I don't usually miss a day. 11:20 a.m. — Literally can't wait to eat so I warm up the lunch I brought from home — tilapia and broccoli — and eat at my desk (so that no one can see me eating lunch so early!). 1 p.m. — Meet a coworker for a break at the coffee bar in our office. She gets a grande black coffee and I get a hot tea to soothe my throat. I buy both. $3 4 p.m. — Snack on a Honeycrisp apple while working on my budget spreadsheet. I usually check my budget one or two times a week. When I first started working, I saved almost no money, so in November I created a budget for myself and made a goal to put $10,000 in savings by the end of 2018! It keeps me motivated to not spend as much. 7 p.m. — Home after the gym. I preheat the oven to make more tilapia and broccoli for dinner. While my tilapia bakes, I put chicken in the fridge to defrost for dinner tomorrow and prep overnight oats for tomorrow's breakfast. I've never made them before but I throw in oats, almond milk, a little maple syrup, nutmeg, and strawberries and hope for the best! Daily Total: $3",5,64
"6:50 a.m. — Sleep in again since I am determined to beat this head cold. Since I'm usually up at 5:30 a.m. for the gym most mornings, sleeping in for the past two days has felt luxurious. I roll out of bed and make coffee and then shower and get ready for the day. 8:30 a.m. — At my desk I eat the overnight oats, which are surprisingly good. I've got a knot in my stomach, though, because my ex and I work in the same building. He's been traveling most of the month but I know he gets back today so there's a possibility of running into him. We haven't spoken since our coffee and I am hoping to avoid him. Breaking up with someone you love and care for is one thing but then adding in the possibility of running into them every day is a whole new level of emotional torture. I take a deep breath (realize my head cold is better, yay!) and remind myself that there are problems in the world so much larger than mine and that I will be fine. 11 a.m. — I've spent all morning creating flow charts so I take a quick break to eat a banana, fill up my water bottle, and stretch my legs. 12:30 p.m. — Eat lunch with my coworkers. I have leftover tilapia and broccoli. Inevitably, I see my ex. Try not to make eye contact but feel my face flush bright red. Ughhh. 4 p.m. — I have a phone interview with my alma mater. They are writing a story on me and I don't feel like I did enough in college for this honor but I'm flattered nonetheless. After, I head home and chat with my roomie and her BF. I snack on a rice cake and strawberries before going to the gym. 7 p.m. — After the gym, I call my dad and he gives me a quick pep talk. He can make me feel better no matter what. I swing by Trader Joe's on my way home and pick up a few things to make curry for supper. I grab riced cauliflower, bell peppers, butternut squash soup, and red curry sauce. I can't keep away from the snacks so I also grab Joe-Joe's cookies, peanut butter-filled pretzels, and granola bars. $17.81 9 p.m. — The curry ends up being delicious. I eat two bowls while hanging out with my roomies and watching the Celtics game. Daily Total: $17.81",6,64
"5:20 a.m. — I get dressed for the gym. I check my sleep-tracking app and see I only got about five hours of sleep, so I make coffee before leaving. 7:30 a.m. — I'm at work super early so I treat myself to a second coffee to go with the peanut butter protein shake I brought from home. The coffee bar at my work is subsidized so I don't feel bad buying a venti cold brew for less than $2. $1.93 10 a.m. — I'm powering through a bunch of documentation for a new project I'm on and realize my stomach is grumbling. I have no snacks at my desk and it would be embarrassing to heat up my lunch this early so I go to the cafeteria and get a sausage, egg, and cheese breakfast sandwich on a bagel. $2.50 12 p.m. — I eat lunch with coworkers again and also buy a warm chocolate chip cookie because I have no willpower against warm, chocolatey goodness. $2 7 p.m. — I meet my roomie and one of our friends for beers after work. I get two Gruits plus buffalo popcorn chicken and fried calamari for the table to share. $42 Daily Total: $48.43",7,64
"7:15 a.m. — I wake up way later than usual and struggle to keep my eyes open. I got plenty of sleep, but I'm still exhausted because my boyfriend and I have had family in town (including his daughter) for the last week. This morning, I'm dropping off my parents and sister at the airport before I resume my regularly scheduled life. After scrolling through Facebook and Instagram and playing Word With Friends, I finally get out of bed. I bundle up because it is unusually cold outside (29 degrees! In Austin!), and greet my boyfriend and dog. I down a chocolate protein shake with a little cinnamon added in for flavor and then pick up my family from their hotel and drive 20 minutes to the airport. I'll miss them once they're gone, but for now I'm ready for a few days of normalcy post-holidays. 9:45 a.m. — Traffic wasn't too bad this morning and I make it home at a reasonable hour and start my work day. I work from home, so my schedule is pretty flexible. That said, I have a heavy workload at the moment and I'm motivated to wrap up some of my current projects before new ones are added. Not to mention that reaching project milestones means more monthly bonuses for me and getting closer to my goal of becoming debt-free by the end of the year. (I'm using Dave Ramsey's debt snowball method.) One things I love about my job is that I have uncapped earning potential. With my current workload, at a minimum, I will earn $95,000 in total comp for the year, but I expect that it will be more based on last year's numbers. 12 p.m. — My boyfriend and I need to make a grocery run so that I can make chili for dinner tonight. Ideally, this would have already been prepared in time for today's lunch, but I didn't have time to shop while the family was in town. I buy gas at Circle K on the way there. I can't believe it's gone up almost $0.20/gallon in one week! $20.06 12:30 p.m. — We head to Target where we pick up two bell peppers, two cans of black beans, eggs, almond milk, and sparkling water. This will only hold us over for a day or so, but the longer shopping trip will have to wait. We stop at the Starbucks in the shopping plaza (the one at Target is always understaffed with a huge line), and I pick up the trenta unsweetened black iced tea that I've ordered on my app. It's usually $3.19 but I pay with a gift card my friend gave me for Christmas. $16.51 1:30 p.m. — Back home, I bake some of the chicken tenders that we bought for my boyfriend's daughter in the toaster oven. While they are cooking, I buy a pair of black Vince Camuto booties that I've had my eye on and two pairs of fleece-lined tights from Nordstrom online. I might have to go to NYC on a business trip at the end of the month, and my old black boots finally died after a recent trip to London. $162.27 5 p.m. — I call it a day and head to the kitchen to eat a bowl of the chili that I put on to simmer after lunch. I somehow forgot to buy half of the ingredients that I needed, but it tastes good anyway. My boyfriend and I decide to stay in and watch Netflix tonight. I play games on my iPad, and we go to bed around 9:30. Daily Total: $198.84",1,65
"7:30 a.m. — Slept in late again! I must have been seriously wiped from last week. I get out of bed, throw on comfy pajamas, and down a protein shake. I forgot to add cinnamon, so it's pretty gross. I crack open the new bottle of mineral oil that I ordered last week from Williams Sonoma, and apply it to my wooden cutting board. It makes an immediate and noticeable difference in the appearance and texture of the wood. I leave it on the counter to soak in and plan to add another coat later. I head to my home office to begin the work day. 11 a.m. – I get confirmation that our managing partner does, in fact, want me to come to the NYC office at the end of the month, so I book my flight and hotel. Delta has a convenient direct flight to JFK for less than $300, so I book that and pay a premium for preferred aisle seats. I log in to my boyfriend's Starwood Preferred Guest account (he has platinum status and gets better rates) to book my hotel. I find a great deal on a hotel ($440.51) that's just a short walk from my office, and book it. ($775.11 expensed) 12:30 p.m. — Leftover chili for lunch with mandarin flavored sparkling water. 4 p.m. — Today is a very busy workday full of candidate calls, planning, and writing bios for a client deliverable that is due tomorrow. I resolve to finish half of them today and do the offer half in the morning. 6 p.m. — Leftover chili for dinner and boyfriend and I catch up on before bed. Daily Total: $0",2,65
"7 a.m. — I'm slowly creeping back toward my normal 6:30 a.m. wakeup time. Perhaps my internal clock will reset over the weekend. For now, I forgo my usual phone scroll and hop out of bed to get dressed right away. My boyfriend (who also works from home) and I are planning to check out the H-E-B near our apartment this morning to determine if it will fit our grocery  needs. We just moved to Austin a couple of weeks ago and have yet to find our go-to grocery store. I down my protein shake, drink a glass of water, and make myself a mug of tea before working on a request that my boss sent me late last night. I finish up those emails and we head out to the store. 9 a.m. — Oh man, I'm starving! In the car on the way back from the store, I eat pepperoni slices that we bought at the deli and drink a bottle of unsweetened iced tea. The store was kind of a bust (we only eat organic and they didn't have a great selection) so we left with just a few staple items: black and cannellini beans, canned tomatoes, baby carrots, bell peppers, avocados, chipotle hummus, baby spinach, deli meats, chicken stock, pistachios, a rotisserie chicken, and my iced tea. The search for the perfect store continues. $98.44 11 a.m. — Scrounge around in the kitchen for lunch; end up eating a bowl of rotisserie chicken and baby carrots. 5 p.m. — Another very busy day at work. Everything that was pushed out for the holidays is coming back to haunt me. I spent three hours finishing up a report to send to one of our clients, made some calls, and call it a day promptly at 4. My company does early release every Friday, which is one of my favorite perks. We ate the last of the chili yesterday, so tonight I make beef stir fry with broccoli, bell peppers, and onions. I buy all of our beef from Crowd Cow (super cool online company that lets you buy ""shares"" of a cow from a local farm), and one order usually lasts the better part of a month. In late December, I placed a huge order for steaks, a roast for Christmas, stew meat, stir fry pieces, and 14 pounds of ground beef that we're still working our way through. Daily Total: $98.44",3,65
"7 a.m. — Saturday is here! I've been looking forward to today all week as we're taking our dog to her first ever Vizsla meet up. There will be 20-plus dogs of the same breed for her to run around and play with. I'm curious to see if a lot of her behaviors are breed traits that will be mirrored in the other dogs. I quickly get dressed, down a protein shake and a few slices of bacon that my boyfriend prepared, and get ready to head out. The meet-up is at a dog park on the far side of town so we leave a little early to give ourselves time to get lost. We pull into a Starbucks drive-through on the way for an order of egg white sous vide bites and a trenta unsweetened iced green tea. My remaining gift card balance won't cover the $8.55 needed to pay for this order, so I load $30 onto my card. $30 11 a.m. — The meet-up was so fun! There were a ton of Vizlas, and it was so cool to watch them all run around together. Our dog passes out as soon as we get into the car, and we drive straight home. I eat a bowl of rotisserie chicken and carrots for lunch. 4 p.m. — We met with two dog sitters from Rover today, and found a great sitter for when we're away visiting family next month. I book the stay on our drive home, and Rover immediately bills it to my card. $160.50 6 p.m. — Dinner was fun to prepare tonight as it was my first time using the spiralizer that my boyfriend got me for Christmas. I made zucchini noodles with chicken in a lemon garlic brown butter sauce. It was delicious and there was a little bit leftover for another meal! Daily Total: $190.50",4,65
"9 a.m. — I'm meeting up with a girl from Bumble BFF at the dog park for a puppy playdate. I get up, bundle up for the cold weather, down my protein shake, and head out to the park. 11 a.m. — OMG. I got stood up! This has never happened to me before. It's such a weird feeling! My dog and I meet some other dog owners and dogs at the park and have fun anyway. I pull into the drive-through at Starbucks on my way home and use my free drink reward to purchase my go-to iced tea. I get home and heat up leftovers for lunch. 1 p.m. — As part of our plan to get serious with our finances, my boyfriend and I each bought a three-month gift subscription to MoviePass for Christmas to maximize our ""fun money."" For the $30 that we both spent, we can see a new movie in theaters every day for the next three months for no additional cost. We just received our cards in the mail this week, and today we've decided to test them out for the first time. We go to the Cinemark by our house to see the latest movie. 4 p.m. — The movie is a lot of fun! We decide to pop into Sam's Club afterward to see if it makes sense for us to buy a membership. The main benefit would be the discount on gas that we'd receive as members, since my boyfriend's car requires premium fuel. We explore for 30 minutes and decide to do it. 6 p.m. — I make dinner (lentil pasta with a beef and veggie sauce), and we watch TV for a few hours before bed. Daily Total: $0",5,65
"7 a.m. — Up and out of bed promptly this morning. I drink my protein shake and settle in at my desk. Today is going to be extremely busy, and I'm planning to cut out early to meet another match from Bumble BFF. I have an urgent request from my boss for a project and I dive into that first. 11 a.m. — Leftover pasta for lunch and back to churning out emails for the next few hours. 3:30 p.m. — Wrap up a great call with a fabulous candidate, send a note to my boss letting him know, and then shut down my laptop for the day. I quickly primp before leaving to meet my new Bumble BFF in downtown Austin. 6:30 p.m. — The meeting is a success! We share a lot of the same views on relationships and the world. Definitely a keeper. I order one skinny margarita and a trio of tacos for dinner. We each pay our own tabs, and agree to get together again soon before leaving. $20 9 p.m. — I turn in early and browse the web on my iPad before going to sleep. Daily Total: $20",6,65
"7 a.m. — I guess this is my new wakeup time. I play Words With Friends in bed and check Instagram before getting up and hopping in the shower. Afterward, I drink a glass of water, put water in the tea kettle to boil for my morning tea, and drink a protein shake. I'm feeling extra hungry today so I also microwave three slices of bacon. Work continues to be pretty busy. This morning, I focus on finally clearing out my inbox post-holiday, and take a couple of calls. 11 a.m. — Lunch time rolls around, and I remember that I was planning another experiment for lunch and dinner today. I am attempting to make pasta e fagioli soup with lentil pasta but what comes out definitely isn't soup. It smells and tastes pretty good, though. I suppose I'm going to strike out sometimes when trying new recipes. Gotta keep at it to diversify our menu. 1 p.m. — My boyfriend and I are visiting his grandparents in Northern California next month and were originally planning to stop in Napa for a couple of days, too, but we ended up canceling our hotel reservation to save money. We're kind of regretting that decision, so my boyfriend checks his Starwood Preferred Guest points balance and we have just enough to stay in Napa for two nights for free, so we book it. We each buy a $75 ticket for the release party for Silver Oak 2013 Napa Cabernet and call it our Valentine's gifts to each other. We also have a membership to one of the wineries up there that includes a free tasting whenever we visit, so it should be a pretty budget-friendly trip. $75 4 p.m. — I have a craving for Starbucks and I convince my boyfriend to go with me. I order my iced tea through the mobile app. The cost is deducted from my remaining gift card balance. My boyfriend doesn't want anything, but drives me there anyway. That's real love! 6 p.m. — We both heat up leftovers for dinner, and watch a few episodes of on Netflix before going to bed. Daily Total: $75",7,65
"10 a.m. — Enjoy sleeping in a bit because it's Sunday. I'm eventually forced out of bed to feed my kitty; he won't stop crying and licking me for attention until I fill his bowl. Wander into the kitchen and make a breakfast of kiwi, raspberries, a piece of toast with peanut butter, and coffee with almond milk. Scroll through social media and read a few articles before getting ready. 12:30 p.m. — Meet a friend for a barre class in Williamsburg. I've never tried barre before but have been on an exercise kick lately and I'm willing to give it a shot. This studio isn't covered by my ClassPass membership, but as long as I use my full membership credits monthly, I don't feel guilty about paying out of pocket for a few additional classes. $34 2 p.m. — We continue our lady time with brunch at the most adorable little spot around the corner from the barre studio. I order eggs, toast, and hash browns with a gin and cucumber cocktail that I drink a little too quickly. I have a wonderful afternoon catching up with my friend, and we make a promise to make this a regular Sunday tradition. It's a far cry from my usual ""drunk brunch"" Sunday activities! $35.04 4 p.m. — I part ways with my friend and take the subway back to my neighborhood. Swing by the grocery store to pick up a few items for the week – onion, spinach, zucchinis, avocado, tomatoes, rice, a can of crushed tomatoes, rolls, ground turkey, and ground beef. $33.39 5:15 p.m. — Get back to my apartment and unpack the groceries. Cooking and unwinding on a Sunday evening is one of my favorite parts of the week. I prep meals for the next few days, including my perfected tomato sauce recipe, meatballs with the ground beef, tacos with the ground turkey, and Spanish rice. 7 p.m. — Shower, apply a face mask, and spend a few hours on the couch watching Hulu with my two roommates. We've been re-watching the last season of before binge-watching the newest season. I snack on two meatballs and a roll plus a few Swedish Fish from my secret stash. These fish are my weakness. 10 p.m. — I crawl in bed and my kitty sprawls out on my chest in a way that makes any movement on my end nearly impossible. If only he weren't so cute! Read a few chapters of by Malcolm Gladwell before going to sleep. Daily Total: $102.43",1,66
"6:30 a.m. — Alarm goes off and I groan at the thought of facing a Monday. I end up hitting snooze for nearly an hour before getting out of bed to feed my kitty. Pack my lunch of zucchini noodles and meatballs in sauce and my breakfast smoothie, which I made from oats, coffee, almond milk, peanut butter powder, and a frozen banana. 9:45 a.m. — Get to work and I'm only a few minutes late – a miracle given the subway delays and sweaty train cars that I dealt with this morning. I'm immediately thrown into a work tornado; calls are coming in so fast I can't even finish a conversation before a new call beeps in. I chug my smoothie as I conduct a few phone interviews and prep a nervous candidate for his interview with my client later. 1 p.m. — I am mentally drained when my work BFF pops into my office and convinces me to come with him to Chipotle. I had every intention of eating my packed lunch but an escape from the office and guacamole are too tempting. We have a good catch-up about our weekends during the walk. The person at the counter forgets to charge me for the guac and I take this as a sign that this excursion was meant to be. $13.12 4 p.m. — After a few more hours of general craziness at my desk, I come out of my office to joke around with my team. 6 p.m. — Leave the office and head out as a team to a local Irish pub that has become our go-to. We don't typically go out on Mondays but two of my employees are leaving us this week, and tonight is the only night that works for the group to get together one last time. I also invite a few former employees from the last few years, and the night becomes a really fun going away and reunion celebration. The bar gives everyone a free shot with their first drink, and after five beers, I'm feeling quite good. $25.60 12:30 a.m. — The group dwindles down to just a few committed drinkers, but eventually someone remembers that it's a Monday and we should all head home. I really try to be good about not wasting money on Ubers, but after so many drinks and given how late it is, I order a car. It's pricier than usual but worth it to be home and passed out before 2 a.m. $43.55 Daily Total: $82.27",2,66
"6:30 a.m. — Is there any sound worse than your alarm screeching before 7 when you're hungover? I eventually force myself out of bed, feed the kitty, take a few Motrin, and get ready for work. I make a quick smoothie before heading out. 9 a.m. — I have my weekly therapy appointment on Tuesday mornings. I started going to therapy awhile back after a bad breakup, and my sessions have transitioned from crisis management to part of my self-care routine. We have a really good session and I leave ready to take on the day and 2018 in general. What hangover? 10:30 a.m. — Get to the office and my smoothie isn't enough to get the day started, so I run down to the café in our building and get a whole wheat everything bagel with avocado spread and a coffee. Once upstairs, I get a call from a client letting me know they're ready to make an offer to my candidate. I'm so happy! Aside from the commission, I've been working with this candidate for months and am thrilled to have finally gotten her an offer. $5.66 1 p.m. — After a few hours of work, I head downstairs for my daily cigarette. I've been a smoker for a few years and am really trying to quit. I bought a vape that I use to replace the habit throughout the day but I'm still treating myself to one actual cigarette per day for the time being. Baby steps! I grab a Diet Coke from the café downstairs on my way back in. $1 1:30 p.m. — Eat my packed lunch from yesterday while I meet with my employee whose last day is today. We tie up a few loose ends and then spend time reminiscing and making promises to stay in touch. I'm really going to miss him! 6 p.m. — Spend a few hours meeting candidates in back-to-back interviews. I really need to find a replacement to help with my loss of recruiters this week, but I have yet to meet anyone that could be a good fit, which is really frustrating. I give my employee a huge hug when he leaves and try not to tear up. 8:10 p.m. — Phew! Finally done in the office. I tend to stay late most nights to get work done in the quiet when my team leaves, but I'm anxious to get home. Hop on the subway and heat up tacos and rice for dinner when I get back to my apartment. 11 p.m. — Finally crash in bed after cleaning up the kitchen and doing dishes. I don't have the mental capacity for a book tonight, so I read a bit of on my Texture app before passing out. Daily Total: $6.66",3,66
"5:45 a.m. — After a few hits of the snooze button, I force myself out of bed. Even my kitty is too tired to be up – I can't rouse him until he hears the musical sounds of his canned food. I prep my usual smoothie, pack leftover tacos and rice for lunch, and leave the apartment. 7:30 a.m. — Early morning spin class! This one uses my ClassPass credits. I shake off my sleepiness within a few minutes and hit a new personal high score on my bike. I credit these new floral leggings I bought last week at Old Navy for giving me life this morning. I shower, change, and blow my hair out in the locker room before heading to work. 9:15 a.m. — I have every intention of drinking my breakfast smoothie this morning, but I run into my work BFF on the way into the building and find myself going to the café with him for more sustenance. I order the usual bagel/avocado and coffee and leave my smoothie for later. $5.66 1:45 p.m. — I snag a dollar from work BFF to grab a Diet Coke downstairs, as I'm out of cash. We tend to go back and forth with spotting each other for various snacks and drinks and always just consider it even. I also enjoy my daily cigarette before heading back upstairs to eat my tacos and rice for lunch. 5 p.m. — Have a long meeting with my boss about 2018 goals and the recent changes in my team. We blew past our 2017 revenue goal, so we're increasing our goal for 2018 significantly. I'm confident that this will be attainable, but with the loss of two recruiters this week, it'll be a bumpy ride for the first few months. 7:30 p.m. — I finally head out of the office. Another late night, but I had a heart-to-heart about the future of the company with one of my most senior recruiters after everyone left, so I'm considering it a night well spent. 8:45 p.m. — Swing by the grocery store on the way home to grab a roll, avocado, and toilet paper. My roommates and I all grab household items as needed and because no one ever feels like they're doing more than they should, we just call it even and don't keep track. $6.70 9:15 p.m. — I make a meatball sub and side salad for dinner along with a few more Swedish Fish as a treat. I force my roommates to watch with me against their will – this is one guilty pleasure that I have zero guilt about. 11:15 p.m. — Switch up the reading tonight with by Roxane Gay and cuddle up with my kitty to sleep. Daily Total: $12.36",4,66
"5:45 a.m. — Another painful wakeup time. Kitty is giving me a dirty look this morning; he doesn't approve of me interrupting his beauty sleep this week. I feed him, pack my lunch, and head out. 7:30 a.m. — This morning's workout is an amazing class a coworker introduced me to recently: It's a mixture of cardio, weights, and hip-hop. Is there any better way to start your day than with a little twerking? I pay for this class out of pocket because it isn't on ClassPass. I shower and get ready at the studio before leaving for work. $32 9:20 a.m. — Once again, I give in to the temptation of grabbing breakfast downstairs at work and get a bagel and coffee. I'm already getting bombarded with calls before I even make it upstairs. $5.66 11 a.m. — This morning is hectic but in a good way. I am close to closing a placement that would be huge for me — if it goes through, my commission would be about $10,000. My candidate's and the client's feedback are really good, and I cross my fingers that we'll make it through the salary negotiation stage without any major problems. 2 p.m. — I'm out of cigarettes so I reluctantly head to the pharmacy for a new pack. Going through a pack every few weeks instead of every few days is definitely helping my wallet, and I pat myself on the back for the progress I've made. I also grab a lighter, a bag of almonds to snack on at my desk, and two Diet Cokes; the extra one is for my work BFF. Back at the office, I eat lunch from home. $19.99 6 p.m. — Time to say goodbye to the second person leaving my team! I try to keep an open dialogue with my team about their career goals, even when it doesn't include staying with me forever. Because of that, I was able to place this employee at one of my clients! I try not to tear up when I give her a hug and remind myself that we will continue to speak daily. 7:40 p.m. — Finally leave the office and go to my nail salon for my semi-regular gel mani ($34) and neck massage ($14). In addition to doing a great job with nails, this salon is my fave because they are always playing a rom-com on TV for their customers – tonight's is . I leave a $10 tip. $58 8:50 p.m. — My absolute favorite pizzeria in the city is across the street from my nail salon, and I grab a slice and Diet Coke after I do my nails. I enjoy having the entire night feel like a treat. $5.15 10:30 p.m. — Finally home! I tidy up the apartment, make a smoothie and lunch for tomorrow, and crawl into bed. I pick up but only make it a chapter before falling asleep. Daily Total: $120.80",5,66
"7 a.m. — Sleeping in feels amazing this morning! I hit snooze a few times but get up quickly when I hear something crash in the kitchen. Kitty was getting impatient for breakfast and knocked a bowl off the counter; luckily, it's not broken! Get ready for the day and head out. 9:45 a.m. — I resist the bagel temptations this morning and I drink my smoothie at my desk and hunker down for a busy Friday. 11 a.m. — Take a break from work and browse the Internet a bit. I order a new vape (I dropped mine the other day and it has been leaking slightly since.) I don't want any excuse to not stick with this new lifestyle, so I'd rather pay for a new one ASAP before the leak worsens. $28 1:30 p.m. — Eat the last of my tacos and rice for lunch. I also bring a second helping for my work BFF. He was drooling at the smell of it all week, and I generally bring him leftovers at the end of the week instead of throwing away the extra food I make. Cooking for one person is a difficult science when it comes to portioning. 3 p.m. — I spend another few hours interviewing candidates for my team, and I meet someone I love! She has everything I'm looking for and her answers to my questions don't sound overly-rehearsed. I thank the recruiter who found the candidate and start the process of getting internal approvals to hire. 5:30 p.m. — We've all had a long week here at work. Some of my recruiters come over to hang and chat for the last few minutes of the day, and I let them leave a few minutes early. 6:30 p.m. — I meet up with a friend for a long overdue dinner and catch-up. We have reservations at a restaurant near Union Square that has a very weird, almost creepy, Victorian vibe. I love it. I order a BLT with avocado and a side salad. I also enjoy two glasses of sauvignon blanc. We have a great time but are both tired from the week and decide to call it a night after dinner. I put the bill on my card, but she Venmos me for her meal on the spot. $49.97 10:45 p.m. — I get home and am exhausted, so no reading tonight. Instead, I watch on Netflix before bed. I've watched the series twice already but can never get enough Ron Swanson in my life. Daily Total: $77.97",6,66
"10:15 a.m. — I could have slept in longer, but my kitty had other demands. I get up to feed him but then crawl back into my warm bed and grab my book. I have no plans any time soon and enjoy the lazy morning. 12 p.m. — Finally extricate myself from bed and head to the kitchen. I make coffee with almond milk and brainstorm breakfast ideas. I end up combining leftover ground turkey, scrambled eggs, tomatoes, and spinach and throw it in a tortilla for a breakfast taco. I chat with my roommate and then we watch . 3 p.m. — I finally motivate myself to start my laundry. The amount of dirty laundry that has piled up in my closet is actually ridiculous. I do two loads ($10 total) but I'm stuck paying a $1.75 ATM fee at a corner store because I didn't plan ahead to get cash at my bank. The laundromat is a block away so I come back between loads to clean the apartment. $11.75 6:15 p.m. — I finally finish my afternoon chores, shower, and get ready for the evening. I head to Manhattan to catch my college basketball team play at Madison Square Garden. I haven't been to a game yet this year but try to come out for a few and show my alumni spirit! I Venmo my friend on the way for my ticket. $40 7:10 p.m. — Meet up with two friends for pizza and beer that all the students and alumni have deemed the go-to pregame spot. I grab two slices ($5.90) and a beer for myself and the others ($16.50). $22.40 8:20 p.m. — Game time! We are most assuredly going to lose — the opposing team is fantastic —but it's nostalgic and fun to be back at a game. We grab two more beers each (we're taking turns paying) and make friends in our section. The game is much closer than it should have been, and we're happy to see our team do better than expected. Madison Square Garden is still wild with fans, and everyone spills out onto the street for the next adventure. 10:30 p.m. — We go to a local bar that is again packed with my school's fans, both students and alumni. While standing in line for the bathroom, my friend and I hit it off with cute guys wearing lacrosse shirts from our school. Unfortunately, we realize that they are athletes and not alumni ... talk about feeling old! We quickly dodge the situation before they realize how old we are and head back to our table. We all split a pretzel and a few more drinks and divide the bill evenly at the end of the night. $20.53 1:45 a.m. — Feeling quite proud of myself because I resisted an Uber even after all the drinks tonight! After a long subway ride home, I dive into bed and don't even make it through one episode of before falling asleep. Daily Total: $94.68",7,66
"10 a.m. — Wake up with sun shining brightly in my face (a rarity during Seattle winters), and snuggle with my boyfriend, *B. He hops out of bed to make coffee and brings me a cup in bed, a sweet little gesture he makes every morning that means a lot to me. I drink my coffee and read in bed for a while. I am obsessed with memoirs and mysteries and am currently making my way through all of Lisa Gardner's mysteries. Her plot twists are unparalleled. 11 a.m. — B. makes cinnamon toast with bread that his mom made for us! It is delicious and reminds me of what I ate for breakfast as a child. After finishing up our toast, B. pulls me back into bed for some quality time before we both head to work ;). 2 p.m. — Leave my apartment and go to work, which is only about a 15-minute trip. 3 p.m. — I eat snack with my clients and then peruse the internet. I've been waiting for a sale on glasses through EyeBuyDirect for a few weeks and today all frames are BOGO so I decide to go for it! I buy six pairs of frames knowing that I will probably return at least four. There is a tool for ""trying on"" the glasses online by uploading a photo of yourself but I never know how the glasses will look until I actually try them on at home. $163.23 6 p.m. — Spend the afternoon hanging out with my clients, playing card games, and watching a Disney movie. Dinner is chicken fingers, seasoned fries, and carrot sticks with my clients! I dunk the carrots in a solid amount of ranch dressing because I loathe carrots. The group of clients we have right now is on the quieter side so my coworker and I spend time telling jokes. 10 p.m. — Say goodbye to the few clients who are still awake and then go to a grocery store near my apartment. I pick up a random assortment of items including a tin of raspberries, cotton pads, ice cream, chips, milk, and turkey bacon. $17.52 12 a.m. — After I get home I light candles (a nightly ritual for me – I am a candle maniac) and do my skincare routine. I read in bed for a while and wait for B. to come home from work. When he gets home we talk about our respective days, snuggle in bed, and eventually pass out. Daily Total: $180.75",1,67
"10 a.m. — Wake up and snuggle in bed with B. for a while, the most peaceful part of my day. I usually don't set an alarm unless I have to be at work early for a meeting, which makes my slow-moving mornings that much nicer. B. makes coffee and brings me a cup in bed while I read and mess around on my phone. B. eventually joins me back in bed and we enjoy sexy time before cleaning our apartment. This is a Sunday morning ritual for us: I clean the kitchen, living room, and bedroom and B. takes on the bathroom and the vacuuming. 1 p.m. — Give B. a big kiss goodbye and go to work. Once I get there, I pick out an apple with almond butter and chat with newly admitted clients. 3 p.m. — It is an incredibly quiet day at work so I decide to do a little bit of online shopping. I see that there are super cheap tickets for a musical I love ( ) so I buy two ($25) and text a friend to see if he wants to come. Thankfully, he is down and free on the night I booked the tickets! I want to do something fun and special for Valentine's Day with B. because I am mushy like that but also because it is going to be our last Valentine's Day in Seattle. (We are moving in the next few months.) I find a cool event at a distillery where you get a tasting of their liquors and then get to make your own hot chocolate with the alcohol you like the best. I buy two tickets and plan on surprising B. with them tonight! ($43.66) $68.66 5:30 p.m. — Tonight, my coworker is covering dinner with the clients so I eat with another coworker in our break room. Dinner is mac and cheese with lots of hot sauce! I snag fresh veggies from the fridge to munch on as well. Once perk of working at the facility I do is that we always get meals/snacks during the workday, which definitely saves me money on food costs. (Although I love to eat out so it's probably not saving me THAT much money.) I notice that two of my Poshmark bids went through. I am the proud owner of a new sundress, earrings, and a cuff with my favorite stone, ocean jasper. $30.98 8:30 p.m. — Eat the last snack of the day with the clients; this time I choose a Choco Taco and munch on it while playing trivia at my table. These clients know so many random animal facts, it is amazing! I learn that octopi have three hearts and that a group of parrots is called a pandemonium. After snack I head home and B. is already there since he had the day off. We snuggle on the couch, I pour myself a glass of rosé, and we watch the new . We are obsessed with the series and spend the next hour geeking out over how cute puffins are. 11 p.m. — Early to bed for B. and me. I do a quick face mask with Farmacy's Honey Potion (my saving grace for moisturizing – it always makes my skin glow). Then I finish up with the rest of my skincare routine: Acure's glowing serum, retinol from The Ordinary, and Origins Night-A-Mins moisturizer. Daily Total: $99.64",2,67
"9 a.m. — Up and at 'em for an early day. I complete my skincare routine (The Ordinary's Glycolic Acid 7% Toning Solution, REN Radiance Perfection Serum, One Love Organics Morning Glory Caffeinated Firming Serum, and then I mix up Kiehl's Hydro-Plumping Re-Texturizing Serum Concentrate with Caudalie Vinoperfect Radiance Serum as well as Origins Matte Moisturizer) and brush my teeth. Then, I throw on mascara and a bright red lipstick and I am good to go. Give B. a big kiss goodbye and drive to work. 10 a.m. — Answer urgent emails when I get to work and then have morning snack with the clients. Today is a banana, a spoonful of Nutella, and coffee to get the day started. 12 p.m. — Work, work, work, work, work, work. I feel like this day will never end. I was promoted to a management role a few months ago and it has been extremely busy managing my team and the clients at the same time. I snag leftover tomato soup and salad from the break room and eat at my desk (sad, I know). The tomato soup is amazing and I thank the chef who makes all the food for the clients and staff; she is a fantastic cook! 3 p.m. — I grab a brownie for snack with the clients and eat that with a glass of milk and water. It has been a tough day for the clients so I try to keep conversation light and playful. After snack, I interview a potential new hire and decide that she would be a great fit for our team. I have a couple of meetings with various coworkers that fill up my afternoon and make it pass quickly. 6 p.m. — I jet out of work and head over to U-Village, a beautiful outdoor mall in between my work and apartment. I have my eye on a turmeric mask from Kiehl's and since they have a deal where you get extra goodies if you spend over $85, I end up buying a microdermabrasion re-texturizing scrub as well. I got a sample of this scrub a few weeks ago and haven't stopped thinking about it. I will definitely be using both the mask and scrub for a little at-home facial tonight. I poke through Anthropologie and the Gap as well but don't find anything that's calling my name. I leave the mall and drop off books at the library, picking up two new books that I had on hold – (another Lisa Gardner mystery) and Marcus Samuelsson's memoir,  $88.06 8:25 p.m. — I order pad Thai with extra chicken and spring rolls, and get it delivered to my apartment. With my $10-off coupon it's a pretty good deal for the amount of food that I get. I give myself a facial with my new products from Kiehl's and watch while eating my dinner. I fill the bathtub and pour myself a glass of rosé while soaking in the tub with a Lush bath bomb. The water gets cold after only 20 minutes so I hop out and moisturize head to toe. $15.34 11 p.m. — I take a Lyft Line down to the restaurant where B. works to meet him for a drink once he gets off work. $3.63 12:30 a.m. — B. and I catch up on our busy days while sitting at the bar; he orders a beer and I get a glass of rosé. We enjoy relaxing and chatting with some of his coworkers until I realize that I can't stop yawning, which means it's time to leave. The staff at B.'s restaurant loves him and they have gotten to know me pretty well, so our drinks are free! I tip the bartender $5 as a thank you. B and I enjoy the walk home from the restaurant to our apartment, which is made especially pleasant by the fact that it is not raining. $5 Daily Total: $112.03",3,67
"10:30 a.m. — Wake up and snuggle with B. before getting ready. I quickly throw on comfortable clothes, do a quick skincare routine, and brush my teeth. Give B. a kiss goodbye and leave for a doctor's appointment. I have been having abnormally high inflammation on my blood tests and my doctor has been running consistent tests to try and get to the root of the issue. I get my blood drawn and only wince a little. (I am pretty terrified of needles.) No copay because my parents' insurance is amazing. 11:20 p.m. — I notice that my gas tank is low so I fill up on my way home. I get 10 cents off per gallon due to Safeway reward points. After filling up, I drive home and watch the newest episode of while lying in bed. B. has the day off too and is watching a soccer game in the living room. I eat leftover pad Thai while I try to keep my mind off the inflammation thing; t scares me a little to know something may be wrong but not know exactly what it is. B. interrupts my pity party by providing some very welcome sexy time. $26.81 2 p.m. — B. and I shower and get ready to go see a movie! We walk from our apartment toward downtown, stopping at a 7-Eleven to buy candy before the show – strawberry sour straws for me ($1.39) and B. buys his own gummy candy. We enjoy the walk to the theater and purchase tickets for ($5). $6.39 6 p.m. — The movie was alright; the way women were portrayed in the movie made me really mad and the general violence was not for me. I guessed the twist very early on in the movie but B. was blissfully unaware and surprised at the end. We decide to go grab food before trivia tonight and check out a couple places before settling on Rachel's Ginger Beer. B. pays for our chicken sandwiches and we dig in. I get an Asian-inspired sandwich while B. gets one with spicy sauce and jalapeños. 7:10 p.m. — We swing by one of my favorite coffee spots, where I get a caramel latte and split a pear and almond tarte with B. The coffee is delicious and we both finish the tarte in a matter of minutes. After people-watching through the window, we head over to the bar where they are hosting trivia. $12.36 8 p.m. — B. and I manage to get seats by the bar and we are pumped for trivia. We decide on a team name and B. buys us both beers. I give him $3 to cover mine; he gets a Tecate and picks a Bohemia for me. $3 10 p.m. — Whomp, whomp — history repeats itself and we score in the middle of the pack. We felt confident about a lot of our answers, but only got about 70% right. We cut our losses and start walking home. About halfway there, I get a hankering for chips (Cheddar and Sour Cream Lays are my weakness). Before I ask my boyfriend if we can stop at the store, he says he is also really craving chips. I give him a big kiss and tell him I was thinking the exact same thing! We each buy a bag of chips and walk the rest of the way home. $3.29 11 p.m. — We arrive at our apartment and break into the chips while watching more . This episode is all about the deep ocean and while I find it fascinating, it also creeps me out a little. We jump in bed after finishing the episode and fall asleep spooning. Daily Total: $51.85",4,67
"10 a.m. — Spend a lazy, sexy morning in bed with B., and after an hour or so we finally roll out of bed for coffee and breakfast. B. makes coffee, eggs, bacon, and more toast from the bread his mom made for us. We chat over breakfast and then B. heads to work – I have the day all to myself! I hop back into bed with delicious lavender Earl Grey tea and read for a while. 12 p.m. — Make another cup of tea and spend time writing in my journal while watching and doing a few face masks. I choose a brightening pumpkin face mask by Andalou Naturals, followed by a clay mud mask by Kiehl's, and then finish with the turmeric mask I bought a few days ago. My skin is glowing after this pampering. 2:30 p.m. — I get a call from a market researcher and video chat with her for about half an hour. I sign up for market research and focus groups as a side hustle and I bring in a couple hundred dollars a month just by doing this for an hour or so per week. I use the gift cards and money I get from these studies to pay for skincare, clothes, and travel. This research interview pays $85 in the form of an Amazon gift card, so I peruse Amazon after finishing the call, but I don't see anything I really need at the moment. 3 p.m. — B. loves movies and we have been wanting to come up with a way to watch movies since we take forever to agree on one that will fit both of our tastes. I pick out a scratch-off movie poster online that has 100 of the top critically-acclaimed movies, which will be an amazing gift for B. for Valentine's Day. I order it and pay for express shipping so it will be here in time. I have plans to meet a friend for happy hour, so I quickly get ready and run out the door. $22.95 4 p.m. — I drive over to a small Mexican restaurant for happy hour and order a winter sangria while I wait for my friend to arrive. I take one sip of the sangria and feel it almost immediately, so I decide to order chips, salsa, and a few tacos to soak up the alcohol before I keep drinking. My friend arrives and we have such a wonderful time catching up. He has a few margaritas and orders tacos for himself as well. In college, we used to go swing dancing almost every week. Neither of us has danced in a while, so we decide to go dancing together soon. $36.56 6:30 p.m. — I arrive home feeling incredibly tired even though I did almost nothing today! I am supposed to meet another friend for a late night walk but text him and let him know that I probably am not going to make it tonight, and we take a rain check for later in the week. I crawl into bed and read my book for a few hours, then end up falling asleep for a surprise nap. 11 p.m. — Wake up with a start to my birth control alarm going off on my phone! I had no idea that I slept for so long but I feel a lot better. I take my pill and then clean up my apartment a little, doing dishes and tidying up the bathroom. I read more and B. comes home around midnight. We chat about our days, get ready for bed, and then fall asleep almost immediately. Daily Total: $59.51",5,67
"9 a.m. — Wake up to my alarm and quickly get ready for work. On Thursdays, I have a ton of meetings starting at 10 a.m. 10 a.m. — Arrive at work and drink more lavender Earl Grey tea and sit in on my first two-hour meeting. We talk about each client's progress, and how they are doing so far in treatment and with each medical provider. After the meeting, I interview a candidate for my team and it goes very well. I email back and forth with HR about the position during the early afternoon. 1:30 p.m. — Snag leftover lasagna and a roll from the staff kitchen and then eat at my desk while checking my emails. I get an email that I have been waiting for a long time: acceptance into a graduate program for my master's in counseling! I tear up a little and text my family members and boyfriend. I whip out my card and pay the $500 deposit to secure my spot for the fall, which will eventually go toward tuition for the fall semester. I have been working toward this for several years and finally feel ready to go back to school, knowing that my heart and passion is in the mental health field. $500 4 p.m. — Drink coffee and eat animal crackers at my desk while working on training and onboarding materials as well as scheduling my team for the upcoming month. 6:30 p.m. — Leave work to meet a friend at a free DIY Valentine card-making event at a local coffee shop. I am apparently on an Earl Grey tea kick and I don't feel like drinking alcohol so I sip on that while catching up with my friend. We each make several cute cards with the provided materials. $3.50 8:30 p.m. — I drive home and end up ordering delivery from my favorite Indian restaurant. The chicken tikka masala arrives at my door in less than 30 minutes and I am one happy gal. I celebrate by myself and plan to go out with B. this weekend to officially celebrate my acceptance to school! I watch and the latest episode of (I love Fabio!) while munching on my dinner. $18.26 10 p.m. — I paint my nails and then read my book while waiting for B. to come home.

We spend time talking and laughing, then go to bed around 1 a.m. Daily Total: $521.76",6,67
"10 a.m. — Wake up and have a nice romp in bed with B. I don't have to work until noon today so we get time to lay around and cuddle. B. makes coffee and brings some to me in bed. I drink while reading and then get ready before I leave. 12 p.m. — My boss isn't at work today and I have a meeting-free schedule, so I have time to work on various projects and get materials together for the onboarding of a new employee. I grab leftover spaghetti and meatballs from the client lunch. Eat at my desk and chat with my coworkers while eating cake that one of them brought from an amazing bakery. Work through the afternoon, have dinner and snack with the clients, and handle some minor disasters along the way. One thing I love about my job is that I never know what is going to happen when I walk through the door in the morning. 8 p.m. — Head home to quickly put on makeup and change my clothes before going to karaoke with friends! A friend picks me up and drives me to the karaoke bar, something I really appreciate since I don't have to spend money on a Lyft. We get a room and the four of us belt out everything from ""Party In The U.S.A."" to ""Humble"" to ""The Circle Of Life"" over the next two hours. I drink two glasses of house rosé and get nice and warmed up – ready to belt out all the high notes. After the two hours are up, we each pick up our own tabs for drinks and two hours of singing. $27.46 11:30 p.m. — After leaving the karaoke bar, we head over to the restaurant/bar where B. works and each order a glass of rosé. B. brings us complimentary food and we play ""What Do You Meme,"" a hilarious game that I bought him for Christmas. When B. gets off work, he joins us at the table and hilarious chaos ensues as we scream over the already loud music and voices in the bar. B. kindly picks up the tab for our drinks since he gets a discount – what a gentleman! 12:45 a.m. — After we are all tired from several glasses of wine, we go our separate ways. B and I walk home and fall asleep almost immediately. Wine drunk is truly the best drunk. Daily Total: $27.46",7,67
"9:30 a.m. — I wake up in Albany, NY, after arriving the night prior. My friend and I are visiting a close friend of ours and we sleep in much later than we expected. The friend who is hosting is already awake and so is her partner. She makes us delicious cold brew coffee, eggs, and toast. The four of us decide to head to the gym since we know we have a day of gluttony ahead of us. We hit the road (which is a bit icy from snow the night before) and work out for about an hour. 1:30 p.m. — The four of us head into downtown Albany to meet another friend for lunch. We order two orders of pretzel bites, three orders of wings, beers all around, and a salad (for balance). We are all stuffed but happy and split the bill. $28 3:30 p.m. — My friend's partner bought a Groupon for us to do a beer tasting at a local brewery. We get to the brewery and are each given five tokens. We drink as many samples as possible before the brewery closes and play Uno. (My friend who is driving disperses her beers throughout the day.) I leave rather tipsy and play DJ in the car. 5 p.m. — Somehow we end up at another brewery with more beer. We spend a while longer here and play Trivial Pursuit. I love the atmosphere and the beer is good. I would spend every weekend in a brewery if it were both physically and financially healthy. $20 7 p.m. — Today just keeps going! We end up at a new casino in Schenectady. At this point I am drunk so I need to be cautious on how much I gamble. (I hear my mom's voice in my head!) I take out $20 from the ATM, play a few penny slots and electronic roulette ($20). I also somehow lose (and find!) my wallet within 10 minutes of entering the casino. I buy a beer and cocktail for my friend and then proceed to not win anything. $30 8:30 p.m. — I need pizza so I get two slices. $8 9:30 p.m. — Head back to my friend's place and play two rounds of Phase Ten. Then I have another beer and watch the Patriots beat the Titans. We all decide to hit the hay around 11 as we are exhausted and already hungover from the day. Daily Total: $86",1,68

My friend makes us breakfast and coffee and we finish watch a few episodes of . 11 a.m. — I hit the road back to Worcester, only after spending 15 minutes scraping ice from my car. When I left Worcester on Friday it was 60 degrees and raining. As soon as I got to Albany, it started snowing and sleeting. I love the winter, but not when it's two degrees outside. 12 p.m. — My travel companion and I decide we are hungry so we stop for ramen to warm our bellies (and it's freezing outside). I get miso ramen with pork and a Diet Pepsi. We split the bill and continue on our way. $20 2 p.m. — I drop off my travel companion because she is meeting other friends for the afternoon. After I am almost back on the highway, I remember that I will need gas to make it back to Worcester. $20 4 p.m. — Back in good ole Worcester and happy to be reunited with my kitties. I recently adopted a kitten and he and my older cat are still working on getting along. (I call them kitties collectively but my older cat is definitely middle-aged.) I play with both of them individually for a while, clean up their mess from the weekend, and settle in for a night at home. 6 p.m. — Call my parents for our nightly chat. This is something that started in college and we have continued to talk to each other every night since. It is a nice way to connect even if we don't have much to say. I cherish the conversation. 7 p.m. — After spending a significant amount of money over the weekend I opt to cook at home instead of ordering in. I make eggs and French toast. I could honestly eat breakfast for every meal. 10 p.m. — I watch an embarrassing amount of and decide that in my alternate reality, I'll either own my own restaurant or become Alex Guarnaschelli. I go to bed dreaming of the dessert I didn't have. Daily Total: $40",2,68
"9:30 a.m. — I get to sleep in today since my agency is closed for Martin Luther King Jr. Day. I decide that I want to have a productive but relaxing day and vow to only put a few things on my to-do list. 11 a.m. — After a quick breakfast of yogurt, apples, and honey, I head to the gym for a quick cardio session. Last summer, I ran a 10-mile race and did a sprint triathlon. I think that was maybe the last time I exercised? I vow to get back into shape and remind myself that I actually feel good when I move my body. 1 p.m. — After a shower and a quick tour-de-Pinterest, I decide to make turkey chili and creamy lemon-chicken pasta for lunch and dinner this week. I write out my list and head to the store. 1:30 p.m. — They recently built a Chick-fil-A in Worcester and despite my dislike of the company's politics, I cannot resist their chicken. I order grilled nuggets and a side salad with a Diet Coke. I get back to my car and realize they gave me regular nuggets. Oh well, guess I have to eat these. $11 3 p.m. — Back home and feeling proud of myself for not straying from my shopping list. I unload groceries and prep for my night of cooking. $40 5 p.m. — The chili is in the crock pot and my water is almost boiling for pasta. I munch on some Pirate's Booty and play with the kittens. Then it's pasta for dinner. 8 p.m. — I notice that my dishwasher is leaking water onto the kitchen floor whenever I use the sink. This is something that has plagued me since I moved into my apartment three years ago and periodically returns for unknown reasons. I make a mental note to call my landlord in the morning. 10 p.m. — After a couple hours of watching (I was one of those people that never watched growing up but now I am kind of obsessed), I crawl into bed, exhausted.

"7 a.m. — My alarm goes off and I snooze for eight more minutes. After, I hesitantly get out of bed and instantly throw on my slippers and robe. I get some water boiling for my morning coffee, grounding my beans and getting my Chemex ready to go. (It's my newest toy.) I make myself eggs and an English muffin with a side of cucumber for breakfast, shower, get dressed, feed the kittens, and eat my breakfast while watching . I love Gayle! 8:30 a.m. — Get to my desk and am pleasantly surprised by my lack of emails. I sip my coffee and respond to what is there. I have a big day ahead of me as my colleagues and I are meeting with one of our funders for a new project. I have heard that this funder is intimidating and intense so I try to prep myself as much as possible. 12 p.m. — My coworkers and I typically eat lunch together and today is no different. I reheat my pasta leftovers and have an apple with peanut butter and a seltzer. Over the weekend, I discovered the Google Arts & Culture app that compares your selfie to a famous piece of artwork. Mine is ridiculous but kinda looks like me and I am not ashamed. My coworkers all take turns with my phone taking their own selfies and we spend our lunch hour cracking up. It's great to work with people who take their work seriously but also find time for pleasure in the workplace. 4:30 p.m. — My afternoon funder meeting went extremely well and I am excited to continue work on this project. It is a financial justice project helping area residents who have no access to banking. Also exciting is the fact that our agency will be closed tomorrow since it is supposed to snow! I am really happy to work at a place that values employee safety and will cancel work (yet still pay us!) if the weather looks bad. 5:30 p.m. — Home from the gym and eating my chili. It's good but unexciting. I'd prefer tacos. 9 p.m. — A friend comes over to spend the night at my place since it's closer to her office, and she can walk to work in the morning instead of driving in the snow. I catch up with her and my housemate over a bottle of prosecco and other libations. We watch a few episodes of and go to bed around midnight. Daily Total: $0",4,68
"7:30 a.m. — I am awake early since my friend is heading to work and my landlord is supposed to come by with a plumber to look at my dishwasher. I have a little bit of a headache from the prosecco so I immediately drink two full glasses of water as soon as I wake up. I make coffee and egg sandwiches for my friend and me and then curl up on the couch with the kittens while I wait for the plumber. (Spoiler alert: He never comes.) I take two Advil and hope that my headache goes away soon. I decide to be productive with my early morning so I reorganize my closet and do laundry. My headache goes away after the Advil, eggs, and cheese do their job. 12 p.m. — I find some mozzarella sticks in my freezer and decide to have those, a salad, and seltzer for lunch. I also watch more . I try to take a quick nap on the couch but for some reason cannot fall asleep. Instead I decide to do a Cup O' Coffee face mask from Lush. I love skincare products, especially ones from Lush. 2 p.m. — I must get outside! I don't do well cooped up in the house and I decide to shovel out my car and put some salt on the sidewalk. It's technically our landlord's responsibility, but I'm particular about certain things and sidewalk clearing is one of them. I also like to have some ownership over where I live despite being a renter, so this is a way for me to do that and have a safe home at the same time! 3 p.m. — I chat with my best friend who recently moved to San Francisco. I can't wait to visit her once she's settled – I miss her so much! 5 p.m. — The guy I am dating (P.) picks me up and we go to dinner and a movie. The roads are relatively clear but people are still driving horrendously. We go to a pizza place and then see (yas, Meryl Streep). He pays for the food and beer and also the movie. Swoon. 9:30 p.m. — P. has an early morning and I am beat from the day so we part ways and I get into bed. I recently got a bamboo foam mattress pad and it is literally heaven. I chat with my friends for a bit on iMessage and read Reddit. My kitten curls up next to me. Daily Total: $0",5,68
"6:45 a.m. — My alarm goes off and there is a kitten on my face. It's really hard to get out of bed when there is a purring animal anywhere near me. I take a deep breath, move him off me, and get out of bed. I do my typical morning routine (coffee and eggs) and am out the door at 8:15. My commute only takes three minutes and I am at my desk by 8:25. 10 a.m. — My morning meeting was canceled so I have little extra time to write some speaking points for the city manager for an event later this month. I bang that out and drink my coffee and water at my desk. I snack on some dark chocolate too. 12 p.m. — Have my lunch (pasta still) and review notes for a meeting later this afternoon. I chat with P. on iMessage and look at Instagram, Facebook and Money Diaries while I eat. I also look at flights to San Francisco and download the Hopper app to help me buy tickets at the right time! 4 p.m. — I notice that my direct deposit hits, so I pay my remaining bills for the month: a credit card payment, my internet bill, and the excise tax on my car. (Thanks, Massachusetts!) 5:30 p.m. — I'm home from the gym and starving. I eat some chili with a lot of cheese and sour cream on top, then put away my clean laundry from yesterday, shower, and have my nightly chat with my parents. 8 p.m. — I decide I want a cocktail and make myself a vodka seltzer. I also settle in and do some work for a part-time gig that I have, which is coding wire-taps for a friend's company in Philadelphia. It's an interesting way to make a few extra bucks, but it's only temporary. I have muted on the TV. I plug in my headphones and hunker down. 10 p.m. — Finished with the taps for the night and I crawl into bed. I love food and cooking and am trying to read more instead of looking at screens before bed, so I read a few chapters of and fall asleep. Daily Total: $0",6,68
"7 a.m. — It's Friday and for some reason it's always easier to get out of bed on Fridays. I shower, feed the kitties and myself (eggs and coffee – I am a creature of habit), and hit the road to work. 12 p.m. — I had a series of phone conversations this morning about a different food-related project that I manage at work. I am re-energized and excited that people are interested in the work we're doing. I finish the last of my pasta and take a walk to get an Americano. It's sunny and in the mid-30s today, which is practically summer here, so I take advantage. $3 4:30 p.m. — I submit my timesheet and am outta here! After work, I meet up with my friend and we cook a homemade dinner of steak quesadillas with strong whiskey drinks on the side. After dinner, we go to a local hockey game (sponsored by my work, so tickets are free!). 9 p.m. — The game is a blast. It's always fun to hang with coworkers outside of the office. My friend and I head back to my place and have a couple more drinks as we get ready to go to our friends' birthday party at a local spot. After buying drinks for me and the birthday girls ($30), I Uber home around 2 a.m. covered in glitter. $40 Daily Total: $43",7,68
"8:30 a.m. — My boyfriend always gets up before me, which always wakes me up. I love it though: I get to roll around and scroll through the news and Instagram for a bit. It's Saturday so he's not working today. He makes us bacon, egg, and cheeses on everything bagels (which he made from scratch!) with arugula on the side. We watch while we eat on the couch; Ricky Martin is the guest and I didn't expect him to be super interesting but he has amazing energy that is actually lovely. 11 a.m. — I'm getting my period in a week, so this is always a hard time of the month for me emotionally, plus I'm stressed about a project I have. I almost want to go cry in bed but I know I'll feel way better if I work out, so I go to the climbing gym with my BF. He's paying for my membership fee as a sort of birthday present. (It's his way of trying to convince me to get back into climbing.) I climb a 5.10b-rated route that was really hard for me the other day, and today it comes more easily to me. I'm so stoked about the progress I'm making! It's my birthday tomorrow and crushing this route was a goal for me. 2 p.m. — Back home, we drink smoothies and eat leftover meatballs in a marsala cream sauce I made late last night. I also sneak in the last piece of leftover pizza while BF is outside spreading salt on our icy sidewalk. I've been joking forever that all I want for my birthday is Papa John's pizza because BF thinks it's so gross (and it is), but he finally let it happen the other day in a fit of hunger. He's the best. We hang out and nap before going out tonight. 6 p.m. — We Uber downtown to go to a cool distillery for cocktails before dinner. BF has a whiskey sour and I have gin with grapefruit, basil, honey, and probably some other stuff. We have a hilarious and awkward encounter when a larger group at a two-top table sizes up the spots around us at the communal table and we end up switching places with them. They offer to pay for our drinks but we politely decline. BF is paying anyway since it's my birthday celebration. I pay for the Uber though. $9.66 7 p.m. — Fine dining opportunities are limited here in Montana but we pick a place that at least has white tablecloths and looks decent. We enjoy the bread, soup, and salad courses, but we're underwhelmed by our entrées. My short rib is practically swimming in the red wine reduction and I can't even see my mashed potatoes! We get chocolate cake for dessert and it's pretty good. BF gets the Uber home. 9:30 p.m. — Our landlord's cat is waiting outside our house, so we let her in and pet her for a while. We can't have pets in our place, but we love to be with animals every chance we get. I wash my face, use my favorite Glossier serum, and watch bad TV in bed for an hour. ( is so stupid. They all sound and look like rejects from .) Daily Total: $9.66",1,69
"9:30 a.m. — Happy birthday to me! I wake up to a few texts from friends and family. I didn't sleep great, so BF brings me tea and a buttered bagel in bed and I watch clips from last night. 11 a.m. — It's nice outside, so we go for a walk and talk about our plans for this year. We are moving in May, and I might be going to Europe then also, so the logistics are nagging at me. 12 p.m. — I browse Craigslist for apartments and then end up on Brandless, where I buy organic cotton rounds, two packs of organic beef jerky, shave gel, and maple cinnamon twisty things. Shipping is $1 since it's my first order with them (and I'm a sucker for a promo code). I look at ladles on Amazon but can't make up my mind. I'm very particular about my kitchen things being good quality. $16 2 p.m. — We're watching football playoffs today. BF makes pizza dough and then we make a pie with garlic cream sauce, sausage, cherry tomatoes, red onion, and arugula — my favorite! Except we forgot to make mozzarella. (My BF makes mozzarella at home. He's such a crazy weirdo, I love it.) So we make a plain one with olive oil, salt, and red pepper flakes. 3:30 p.m. — The Patriots are winning so we're cranky. I spot the landlord's cat when I'm taking out the trash, so we get some awesome cat therapy snuggles for a bit. 4 p.m. — I want to make cookies but we don't have enough butter so I walk to the corner store and get unsalted butter, eggs, and two bags of Juanita's Sweet Chili chips. Important side note: Juanita's are the best tortilla chips. (I've only seen them out West.) The flavored ones are what Dorito's should be. $14.19 5:30 p.m. — We watch the second playoff game and have cookies for dinner! We put a votive on top of one and BF sings a little ""Happy Birthday"" because I tell him to. I make a wish. 9 p.m. — Birds win! Not my wish but super awesome! BF is from the Philadelphia area so he's stoked his team is going to the Super Bowl. We met in Philly, so it's a second or third home for me, too. We head to bed early. Daily Total: $30.19",2,69
"9 a.m. — BF works east coast hours so I hear him on a conference call when I wake up. We both work from home, which probably isn't ideal. (I work in bed and he gets the table.) We're still figuring out what we want to do long-term since we recently took a break to travel in a van we converted for about a year and a half. It's tricky at times to have an unconventional life, but we love the freedom. 10:30 a.m. — I make us smoothies with pineapple, frozen mangoes, strawberries, spinach, yogurt, milk, and juice, and cut up a kiwi to go on the side. It's a tropical morning inside while it snows outside! 1 p.m. — I've been struggling to come up with concepts for my current client. They've given me free reign, which is a good problem to have, but it makes it so hard for me to narrow down ideas. BF brings me little ham sandwiches on ciabatta he made (have I mentioned he's crazy and amazing?) and a LaCroix because he knows I'm cranky. 3 p.m. — Best part of my flexible work schedule: I can go to the grocery store during off hours! I get bananas, cilantro, cherry tomatoes, paper towels, vanilla extract, cheddar cheese, local organic butter, local flour, and local sliced bread. $42.31 4 p.m. — Score! Birthday cards from my best friend from back home and my mom, who gives me $250 without fail every birthday and Hanukkah. And packages arrived while I was out: a mid-thigh-length down coat from L.L.Bean that went on sale after I first ordered it. (I ordered it again and will return the first one, saving me $60!) I also got a throw pillow and a pack of cloth napkins from Target. We used to use paper towels with our meals and I'm so excited to switch to reusable napkins. 5:30 p.m. — BF is taking a nap so I start marinating chicken for dinner and make a yogurt sauce. I also set up the recurring payments on my health insurance for the year – one major downside of the freelance life. I'm very lucky that my family has been investing money for me all my life, but it does move me into a higher tax bracket. (Ergo, no subsidies on my health insurance and I have a crazy-high deductible.) Thankfully, I don't really use my insurance much. I got an IUD a couple years ago so I have no prescriptions. 6 p.m. — After BF gets up, I work out to a Yoga With Adriene video. Lots of repetitive vinyasas. Her videos always hit the spot. Then I cook the chicken, make rice, and chop up toppings for one of our favorite dinners: street cart chicken! As former East Coasters,  it's a dish we're nostalgic for here in Montana where the ethnic food is limited. We use a recipe from the latest cookbook and for once we manage to save a little for tomorrow. 7:30 p.m. — We hang out on the couch and look at houses and floor plans on Pinterest. We bought a piece of land last fall and hope to be able to build a house on it someday. For now it's just a field, but we'll hopefully plant a big garden there this spring. BF made early investments in Bitcoin and Ether, so he spends a lot of time tracking the charts since they're so volatile. We hope to make good use of his gains for our future. 9 p.m. — I'm super excited for season 3 of When I try to set a recording, I realize I never watched the season 2 reunion. There goes my night. Daily Total: $42.31",3,69
"9 a.m. — I drink mint tea in bed while BF makes us breakfast: bacon, fried eggs, arugula, and sesame-encrusted bread he baked early this morning. We're so lucky to live like this. Granted I'm not saving right now, but I'll get there. I dive into last night's So gross but I can't help myself. 11 a.m. — I smell another lazy day; I end up focusing more on my background TV than the work at hand, I can't seem to dig into this project. Maybe I should go to a coffee shop one of these days. 1 p.m. — I heat up my leftovers and make BF a sandwich since he's stuck on a call. 4 p.m. — Finally picked a ladle I like on Amazon, and get a new dishwashing brush, too. The brush is $10, which seems kind of ridiculous, but it's made of natural materials. I'm trying to minimize our use of plastic, so it's worth the extra money to me. I just wish I didn't have to order it online because I know they'll throw plastic filler in the box they ship it in, but the store doesn't have all-wood brushes. $19.98 5 p.m. — We have smoothies before we go to the climbing gym with apple, pineapple, banana, almond butter, frozen mangoes and strawberries, milk, yogurt, juice, and a sprinkle of bee pollen. I have no idea what the pollen does but we've had it sitting around, so what the heck. 5:30 p.m. — We met friends at the climbing gym, which was nice but meant we stayed a little longer than normal. I did climb a 5.10c route, though, so that was cool! I need to get stronger so I'm not exhausted after just a few routes. 8 p.m. — I whip up a Thai noodle dish (pad see ew, which I get at literally every Thai restaurant I go to) in a sweet soy sauce with bok choi, broccoli, and carrot. We wolf it down on the couch watching , have cookies and milk for dessert, and pet the landlord's cat for a bit before bed. Daily Total: $19.98",4,69
"9 a.m. — One of those mornings where I feel dead asleep like a rock but also very aware of what I'm dreaming about. BF pops in to wake me up for real. We're hopefully going snowboarding today after he does a few hours of work. This will be our second attempt this winter: Since we officially live in Montana now, we're trying to take advantage of all the outdoors things, and all our friends snowboard. The first lesson was brutal and I pray this time won't be as rough. 9:30 a.m. — I force down Cold-Eeze gummies because I woke up feeling a little sick. BF brings me tea to huff over while he makes breakfast. He probably does more than his fair share since I'm a bit of a princess, but I think it all shakes out sort of evenly because I do a lot to keep the house running, like making sure all our bills are paid and doing laundry. I want to stay in bed and watch figure skating videos (they always make me feel better and I'm looking forward to the Olympics) but I drag myself out to the couch so we can eat together. The plate of migas he gives me makes my stomach turn a little, but I still eat most of it hoping it will make me feel better while we watch . 11 a.m. — I can't make up my mind about whether we should go snowboard, but we're supposed to go to Big Sky in a couple of weeks with friends and I hope to be able to do some of the easiest runs when we're there. We suit up and I put on a thick layer of face moisturizer to prep for the outdoors. 11:30 a.m. — We get gas and start the half hour drive up to the hill. It's awesome to have all this great, inexpensive recreation nearby! It's been pretty warm so the road is wet and dirty and our car gets covered in a layer of grime. I kind of love it. Shows we've been out there! $47.76 12 p.m. — Our snowboard practice costs $21 each (I pay for us both), including the rope tow on the bunny hill. I'm still not as good as I'd like to be, and I know I should cut myself some slack, but I can't help but compare myself to my BF curving down the hill effortlessly. I'm sending up huge sprays of snow as I bail out of heel-edge turns. This shit is terrifying and I don't know how I'll manage on a real run with other people zooming around. A posse of little kids learning to ski on the bunny hill rolls around adorably in the snow. $42 2 p.m. — Despite my struggles (and one breakdown because I cry when I'm frustrated), it was a great afternoon. We stop at a deli I've been wanting to try and get an Italian sandwich, a turkey pesto one, a pickle from the barrel, and a blood orange San Pellegrino. Turns out the slaw on the Italian is mayo-based and BF won't touch it, but that's okay with me. $25.20 3 p.m. — I vent to BF about my current project a little. He tries to help but he's an engineer, so talking about design with him can be frustrating. I reply to an email from my client and try to slip in some of my issues. Hopefully she doesn't think I'm being a total pain in the ass! 4 p.m. — Lazy afternoon; BF takes a nap and I get into those skating videos. I tell myself I'm getting better at judging the performances but there are tons of people in the YouTube comments with insane knowledge so I just read what they say and pretend I thought it too. It's really fun seeing the ladies I watched in the Olympics from 1998-2006 when I was into ice skating. I remember all the outfits and Michelle Kwan's Chinese dragon necklace that I totally copied in middle school. #Fangirl. 7 p.m. — I watch with my BF. They work on a tiny cabin, which is right up our alley. Then I catch the second episode of It feels like all other Ryan Murphy stuff in that I kind of hate it but I keep watching until I lose interest or something better comes along. 10 p.m. — I put on a charcoal mask because I feel a zit brewing on my cheek and get in bed, focusing in on a crossword puzzle. Daily Total: $114.96",5,69
"9:30 a.m. — Wake up with a sore neck – I must've fallen harder than I realized yesterday. We have one bagel left so BF makes a bacon, egg, and cheese and we each eat half. 12 p.m. — I want to get out to see if working somewhere else can help me focus better, but I know the café at the grocery store will be super busy right now. I decide to wait it out and make a smoothie with milk, juice, yogurt, apple, pineapple, banana, almond butter, bee pollen, and frozen blueberries. It's kind of a weird mixture but comes out in a pretty color! I watch while I wait for the lunch rush to ease up but then end up just walking to a coffee shop nearby. We don't really need much from the store anyway. 1:30 p.m. — Wow, this coffee shop is actually kind of cool. Go, Montana! It's also kind of tiny so I'm at the cramped bar with my cappuccino, but I manage to make good progress on this project. $3 3 p.m. — I hit a wall and buy a cardamom snickerdoodle cookie to help me along. It's pretty good but I only last 20 more minutes. $5.25 4 p.m. — BF baked ciabatta while I was gone. I truly live Oprah's bread dream. We snack and catch up — and my latest Glossier purchase arrives! I can't wait to cover my face in acid and also read and reread all the instructions and ingredients, probably while peeing. 5 p.m. — BF's dad and stepmom got us two Hello Fresh gift certificates for Christmas and our first box came yesterday; we're trying the first meal tonight. BF is most excited about the orange cashew chicken so I get the rice and sauce going. Before I finish, it's time for This is live TV, not a drill! 7 p.m. — The Hello Fresh was a really sweet gift idea and it's tasty, but the chicken has a funny texture. On TV, BenDeLaCreme comes with the shocking elimination selection! Even though I adore Aja, I've gotta give it up: DeLa definitely deserved to win this one. 9 p.m. — We're already getting ready for bed. We're such boring old people. I tried putting on my new face acid with toilet paper (still awaiting my new cotton rounds) and I get tons of little flakes of paper stuck to me. My face feels smooth though! BF helps me struggle with last night's crossword some more. He comes up with ""peekable"" for the clue, ""see-through."" So groan-inducing. Daily Total: $8.25",6,69
"6:45 a.m. — I can't get back to sleep after hearing BF get up. I dive into the sub-Reddit. The fan theories and dirt on there is exceptional. 8:30 a.m. — Email from another client; I forgot this project would be starting so soon and I hope I can juggle both projects at once. This one is at least a recurring project I've been doing for a few years now, so I can kind of do it on autopilot if I want to. The style could really use a big refresh at this point but I don't know if I have the bandwidth to go there now. Maybe I'll devote time to inspiration and templating when things calm down with the larger project. 12 p.m. — I work on more concepts for the first client, and do that thing where you write an email, edit it a couple of times, look at something else for 10 minutes, and then hit send without looking at it. ( that a thing?) She replies back quickly, very pleased. Holy farts, what a relief! We were thinking about going snowboarding again today because it's been snowing off and on the past couple days, but I feel like today might be better for working and running errands. (Even though the hill will be more crowded on the weekend.) 1 p.m. — I make mac and cheese with broccoli and ham and side salads. Turns out I was wrong about having a productive afternoon. Aunt Flo is here! 2 p.m. — Since I work at home, I make a point to go outside for just a little bit every day. I walk over to a UPS drop box to send my L.L.Bean coat back. I stop at CVS, too, to get a few boxes of tissues ($5), black nail polish (my favorite toe color — $3), and a mint Oreo candy bar ($1.22). It tastes like a crunchy Andes mint and I love it. As I walk up my street I see a deer cross the road, which is totally normal here. Sometimes I feel bad about being a transplant and inadvertently contributing to the growth and sprawl that is going on, but that's just the way it is I guess. $9.22 4 p.m. — Lie down with BF while he naps but I'm too wound up from my walk so I watch TV on my phone. I'm seriously craving carbs but BF talks me off the Domino's ledge and into spaghetti and meatballs. 5 p.m. — We watch while we eat. We don't often watch shows together but we stumbled on this one and both really love it so it's nice to save it to watch together. 7 p.m. — I look at flights to Europe, and also home for a wedding this summer. It's so freaking expensive to fly anywhere from here, which kinda drives me nuts. I also really hate flying after two years of being able to drive everywhere in our van; there's nothing like being on the road and then being able to stop, make a nice lunch in the kitchen, and stretch your legs before continuing on your journey. I'm not making any decisions tonight, so my bank account is safe for now. 9 p.m. — I pop over to Backcountry.com to see if anything good is on sale. I've been monitoring prices on Ibex stuff since they're going out of business. Do I need a third wool shirt? Probably not, but I wear them almost every day in the fall and winter, so yes ($68). I also need snowboarding lenses for sunny days and find some that fit my frames on sale for $33. I ogle a Patagonia duffel in bright violet as well, which I'd love to have for Europe this spring, but I've been on a spending bender lately so I'm just going to add that to my wish list. $101 10:30 p.m. — Definitely time to get off the computer. I hope I'm feeling up to doing physical activity tomorrow, especially since I think BF is going to make another batch of bagels… Daily Total: $110.22",7,69
"10 a.m. — Today is Sunday so I wake up later than usual and lounge around in bed with my boyfriend and our two dogs before we decide to go on a hike. 12:30 p.m. — After I get ready (eating Eggo waffles, changing into gym clothes, and feeding the dogs), my boyfriend asks if I want to bring the dogs with us. I do, but I know they'll get dirty and we'll have to shower them, which takes two hours. Plus, they just got haircuts last week and still smell good. We to flip a coin — heads for bringing them, tails for leaving them — and my boyfriend calls heads. Time for an adventure! 1:30 p.m. — The weather is beautiful and there are a lot of other people outside. The dogs are tired but the five-mile trip is worth it because there's a waterfall at the end of the hike that's great for picture-taking. We brought our fancy camera with us and take great scenic and doggie pictures. 3:30 p.m. — Finally back to the car. I take more pictures with my car for new Instagram content. (I have an Instagram dedicated to my car; it's weird, I know.) Then we head back home. 5:30 p.m. — Done with the showering! The bigger dog is exhausted and keeps falling asleep while we're showering her. Much cute; so tired. 5:45 p.m. — I review the pictures we took earlier today while my boyfriend calls his mom and brother; we decide to all go out to eat. I was born and raised a vegetarian, so sometimes it's difficult finding a restaurant that caters to everyone. Usually we can go anywhere but my boyfriend's family is on the Keto diet right now and today is a bit different. 6:45 p.m. — We wait out the very long line at the restaurant we picked because it'll take at least another 20 minutes to find another place. After we get seated and order, we catch up on everything that's been going on in our lives. My veggie omelet arrives and turns out amazing, complete with hash browns and pancakes. My boyfriend's mom pays. 8:15 p.m. — On the way home, we decide to stop by the Chinese supermarket to get a few groceries. My boyfriend's mom and brother join us because they're looking for Chinese BBQ sauce. We get frozen veggies, fish, two bags of edamame, Chinese eggplant, long string beans, Sriracha, veggie canned duck, and veggie rou song. I pay with cash. $35.76 9 p.m. — My boyfriend's mom and brother stop by our place afterwards for a bit and to say hi to our dogs. While they're all talking, I pack up Etsy orders from my shop that are ready to ship. My shop is mostly dedicated to selling handmade hair accessories and it's well worth maintaining for the amount of money I make from it. Plus, sewing is therapeutic. I made about $100 this week, which is not bad! 10:30 p.m. — They leave to go back home and I head straight to bed. I scroll through the Internet until I fall asleep at 11:30. Daily Total: $35.76",1,70
"7:20 a.m. — Monday Funday. I snooze until 7:45 and drag myself out of bed. 8:10 a.m. — I make my usual breakfast – an English muffin egg sandwich – and wrap it up to take to work. I take my daily vitamins as well. I kiss my dogs and boyfriend goodbye (he started up his own business recently and works from home), and drive our electric car a whopping two miles to work. 8:20 a.m. — I'm parking at work when I look back and realize that the groceries we bought last night are still in the car! Fail. I don't want to turn around so I just hope they'll be okay until I go home for lunch. 9 a.m. — I put aside my egg sandwich and see that another department has brownies. I take one and eat it at my desk. 10 a.m. — I get a phone call from a recruiter saying that one of the companies I applied to wants to do a phone interview with me later this week. I'm excited because I've been working at the same company since college and I think it's time for a change! 11:50 a.m. — I rush home to put the groceries in the fridge and freezer ASAP. Then I finish my sandwich and eat fried rice. 1 p.m. — I drop off the packaged Etsy orders at the post office and go back to work. 5 p.m. — Time to go home and get ready for the gym! I call my mom every day after I get home from work so she knows that I'm safe. (Otherwise she freaks out.) She's been sick the last few days so I encourage her to make a doctor's appointment and get antibiotics. 5:45 p.m. — I'm in the car with my boyfriend on the way to the gym when my sister calls me. She had a miscarriage recently and is still recovering, physically and mentally. I sent her a little gift from Etsy and she just received it, so she calls to thank me and to tell me how she's doing. 6:15 p.m. — Bench press day! The flat benches are taken so my boyfriend and I head to the incline bench. Why is the gym so packed?! We do chest, triceps, and shoulders and then go to the sauna. The sauna is literally my cardio since I don't do cardio. Ain't nobody got time for that! 8:30 p.m. — After showering back at home, we order Mexican food for dinner. My go-to is carne asada fries (with meat on the side, which I give to my boyfriend). I usually put Morningstar veggie crumbles on there too. $17.82 9:30 p.m. — I eat half of my fries and cookies and cream ice cream before making Mickey ears and packaging them up! I've sold a total of four pairs on Etsy today. 11 a.m. — In bed and ready for sleep. Daily Total: $17.82",2,70
"7:45 a.m. — I hit snooze one too many times and finally get up. Same breakfast sandwich to-go and I'm out of the door by 8:15. 8:30 a.m. — Today is busier at work, which is nice. I gobble my sandwich and make at least two trips throughout the morning to the water station. I only drink hot water at work because it's typically cold in the office and also because I'm Asian like that. 11 a.m. — I'm in my first meeting of the day and we are reviewing a new project. I'm excited to be part of the team for this! 12 p.m. — At home for lunch. Leftover fried rice is the dealio! 12:45 p.m. — I've sold three pieces today so I make them really quick at my craft table at home before going back to work. 5:20 p.m. — Done with work! I go home for the obligatory parent phone call and get ready to go to the gym with my boyfriend. 6 p.m. — Another packed day at the gym. Miraculously, both squat racks are open so we snag one and do overhead presses and Good Mornings. My shoulders are sore from yesterday but I ain't a quitter so I ignore it and power through my workout. We end with rows and the sauna. 8:30 p.m. — After the shower, I decide to make myself instant noodles and add in tofu, broccoli, edamame, two eggs, soy paste, and sesame oil. The end result turns out nothing like it's supposed to taste but it's still good and at least I'm getting protein in so I don't have to feel that bad about eating packaged noodles. 10:30 p.m. — I spend the rest of the night preparing for my phone interview and am asleep by 11:30. Daily Total: $0",3,70
"7:40 a.m. — I am up! Same routine – make my breakfast egg sandwich, kiss dogs and boyfriend goodbye, and am out the door by 8:15. 12:15 p.m. — Home! Leftover chili in the fridge along with pancakes makes for a good lunch! Afterwards, I snuggle with my dogs and read online (currently hooked on a vampire book I found for free) before kissing them goodbye and going back to work. 5:05 p.m. — I rush home and call my parents. Today is rest day from the gym (thank goodness because I'm sore everywhere) but I have that phone interview tomorrow, so I spend the rest of the night preparing. I'm not the best at expressing myself so I'm trying really hard to prepare. Haven't had a phone interview since I started working at my current company more than five years ago! 10 p.m. — I eat a quick dinner of Cheerios and ice cream (thug life) and take a quick shower. I also make and package two items I sold today. I'm in bed by 10 and am so sleepy that I almost immediately knock out. Daily Total: $0",4,70
"7:05 a.m. — I set a grand total of five alarms to ensure I wake up in time for the phone interview at 8 a.m. Unsurprisingly, I dreamed about missing the interview last night. 8:30 a.m. — The interview went okay, I think. The HR manager said she will let me know if the hiring manager wants to interview me, which would most likely be tomorrow. I get ready for work, make an egg sandwich, and head out. 9:30 a.m. — I draft a thank-you email and send it to the HR manager. I know I'm going to be nervous the rest of the day about this. 11:15 a.m. — Free Mexican food at lunch today! I get four mini cheese quesadillas, beans, and rice. I know I'm having a light dinner later. 4 p.m. — I haven't heard back yet from the HR manager regarding a second interview, so I email her to say that tomorrow still works but that I will need at least a few hours' notice to ensure that I'll be available. Cross my fingers! 6 p.m. — Finally off work! I make my usual call while I get ready for the gym. My boyfriend and I assess where we are sore and decide to do front squats today. We get to the gym and by another miracle, we score a squat rack again without having to wait. 8:30 p.m. — Ten sets of five reps of front squats with 95 pounds. My clavicle hurts. We sauna for 15 minutes and head home to shower. 9:30 p.m. — Cereal for dinner it is. I love Cheerios. 11 p.m. — Good night world. Daily Total: $0",5,70
"7:40 a.m. — I wake up at 7:20 but I snuggle with my boyfriend and dogs for about 20 minutes before actually getting up. Regular egg sandwich to-go for breakfast and I'm at work by 8:30. 9:45 a.m. — I get an email from the HR manager! I have a phone interview with the hiring manager scheduled this afternoon. I freak out for the rest of the morning while trying to be productive. 12 p.m. — Home for lunch and the interview. I eat, prepare my documents in front of me (resume, cover letter, job description, etc.), and give the dogs peanut butter so they'll be quiet while I'm on the phone. 1:35 p.m. — Done! I feel like this phone interview went way better than yesterday's. The hiring manager was very easy to talk to – personable and down-to-earth. I'm feeling excited about what's next. He mentioned that if they want to take next steps, the HR manager will contact me. Perfect. 5:30 p.m. — I head home and call my parents. I feel like eating out today so I convince my boyfriend to go to Café Spot, one of my favorite Hong Kong-style cafés. I get a tofu steak (a fried block of white tofu with sauce over it) and we get egg waffles for dessert. I have tried many egg waffles in this area and this is by far my favorite place for them. Boyfriend sneakily pays but I give him cash anyways. $10 8 p.m. — My boyfriend asks me if I want to watch a movie on Netflix, but I'm feeling super lazy so I spend the rest of my night looking up fabric and resin parts online for my Etsy shop. Daily Total: $10",6,70
"10:30 a.m. — My boyfriend leaves early to go to Irvine for his part-time job. I decide to use the alone time to go shopping! 11:15 a.m. — First stop: the post office to drop off some sales. Second stop: my favorite boba place. It a has a buy one, get one free deal, so I buy two passionfruit green teas (my absolute favorite!). Third stop is the UPS store, where I pick up a few packages. $4.22 12 p.m. — I head to Walmart next for fabric ($8.42) and Cheerios ($3.64). I find a cruise fabric and a Hello Kitty fabric and then after 15 minutes of waiting, I finally get an associate who can help me. I asked, like, three people and no one knew how to cut fabric. (It's not rocket science!) $12.06 12:45 p.m. — Next I drive over to Joann Fabrics and Crafts, one of my favorite places. I browse around and literally spend half an hour standing in front of their cotton fabrics, finally deciding on some plain ones for my Etsy store. I make sure to use some coupons. $12.76 1:30 p.m. — Last stop: Michaels! I pick up fake flowers for my Etsy wares and take advantage of their coupons, too. $13.49 3 p.m. — I go home and start cutting fabric. is on Netflix and am still amazed at how good this movie is. I also purchase fabric on eBay because Pixar Pier is opening up soon at Disneyland and I want to use it as an opportunity for more sales in my shop. I use my PayPal account, which is replenished whenever I sell something on eBay. (I have everything from Disney items, to stickers, to themed-items listed on there.) 3:30 p.m. — I am starving so I use my air fryer to make air-fried potatoes. I add in sour cream, salsa, avocado, and Morningstar veggie crumbles. It's amazing, and potatoes make me poop, so I never feel guilty eating them. 6 p.m. — Boyfriend comes home and we consider watching a Netflix movie, but decide not to again. I spend the rest of the night crafting with my new fabric. #GrandmaStatus. Daily Total: $42.53",7,70
"6:45 a.m — I struggle to get out of bed before beginning my morning routine of oatmeal, coffee, and getting ready. I talk to my friends and family who are still awake in the U.S., and then head off to work. 8:40 a.m. — Immediately start online shopping as I sit down at my desk. I think twice before dropping money on new jeans and go into my first and only lesson of the day. 10 a.m. — Back at my desk, I swiftly put the jeans and earrings into my shopping cart and purchase. A pair of my beloved jeans ripped on vacation recently, which is how I am justifying this purchase to myself. $91.45 12 p.m. — My school offers lunches for teachers for roughly $40 per month, but I prefer to bring my lunch and avoid the questionable meats. I scurry out of the cafeteria after I eat and go back to my desk. Today is a slow day sitting at my desk working on a multicultural class lesson plan I am doing in the upcoming months. As a break, I start online shopping again. I remember I am running low on a few products that I order from the U.S. every month or so. I restock on all my essentials. $49.66 4:40 p.m. — As soon as the clock hits 4:40, I fly out of work and to the gym. 6:30 p.m. — Finally get home. I start making pasta, check my phone, and straighten up my place. I devour the pasta in just a few minutes, and then hop in the shower. 9 p.m. — I talk on the phone with a guy I've been chatting with. We talk for 45 minutes and I get sleepy, but then end up staying up until 11 talking with family and friends who are just waking up in the U.S. Daily Total: $141.11",1,71
"7 a.m. — I hit snooze two times before actually getting out of bed. My apartment is FREEZING because the heating system in Korea is a lot different than in the U.S. They use floor heating here, so the heat doesn't really stay in my apartment like it should. Despite feeling chilly, I start moving and getting ready for the day. Answer a ""good morning"" text from the guy I was talking to last night, but I'm unsure of how I feel about meeting up tonight. 9:10 a.m. — I get a message from one of my co-teachers about how much I owe for a dinner we all went to on Monday. I transfer her the money, and then start thinking about how great the pizza and pasta were. I might have to eat it again for dinner tonight. $10.64 12:20 p.m. — I thought I'd finished my last class of the day, but I find out that I have an afternoon class with sixth grade again. There was some drama between a homeroom teacher and my co-teacher, so the class got pushed to this afternoon. I always find out last minute about things like this. Unfazed, I start brainstorming activities we can do since we finished the book in our lesson earlier today. My co-teacher and I head to lunch, and I listen to her valid complaints about the homeroom teacher. 2:10 p.m. — Back at my desk until 4:40 p.m. There are absolutely no lessons next week, so there is no planning to do. I focus on my multicultural class materials and watch YouTube videos before I leave for the weekend. This week was unusually exhausting considering I only had 40% of my classes. I'm ready to rest. 4:50 p.m. — I get home and feel like having a night in. Flake on the guy who I talked to last night. He wanted to get dinner, but I really don't feel like socializing. I sit on my phone for a little bit and then finally get up from my bed to make dinner. I throw lettuce, lentils, and sweet potatoes in a bowl and think about how I really should have gone to the store. 7:30 p.m. — I fall into a Spotify hole and start expanding my latest playlist. There is a lot of good music that has just come out and I am really digging it. After listening for a while, I start kind of watching on Netflix, but I'm really only paying attention to my phone. 9:30 p.m. — I talk to my mom on the phone for an hour and a half. I dish on all of my boy drama and work updates from the last week. It is extremely difficult to match up our schedules during the week, so I cherish all the time I get to spend talking to mom. Shortly after our call, I pass out. Daily Total: $10.64",2,71
"9 a.m. — Had quite the snooze this morning. I'm happy I got to rest today because I needed it. I check my phone, get up, and make breakfast. It's also great to feel well-rested after a Friday night because I usually feel like garbage on Saturday mornings. I text my best friend in the States because I am pretty sure she doesn't have work today. We FaceTime for a while and catch up. I love when our schedules line up because I miss her so much and she gives great advice. 11:30 a.m. — I go out to get groceries, and since I didn't go out for dinner and drinks last night, I feel like treating myself at the store. I pick up hot sauce and other splurge items and then grab an Americano at a coffee shop near my house. I end up FaceTiming with another of my best friends when I get home. She catches me up on what is going on back at our university, since she is still a student there. After reminiscing for a while, we hang up and I try to get my day rolling. $29.33 1:50 p.m. — Make lunch and get ready to head to the gym. Lunch is tofu, rice, and salad – super simple. Korea has forced me to eat simply at home, as I prefer to eat plant-based, and the options here for veggies are slim; my main protein staples are lentils and tofu. I listen to my new Spotify playlist to get motivated for leg day at the gym and dance a little bit before heading out. 4:15 p.m. — Finish up my workout and walk home. I eat a quick snack and slowly get ready for dinner with a friend. I turn on the TV in my apartment, which has collected dust since I arrived in Korea. I watch some of the Olympics and get a little bummed out that I blew the opportunity to watch in person when the events are being held only a few hours away from me. 6:30 p.m. — I catch a bus to downtown Ulsan to meet my friend for dinner. I am feeling so much more sociable today. My city only has buses as its public transport, which is a bit of a bummer, because I miss the metro and am not a fan of the jarring bus adventures here. My life flashes before my eyes every time I set foot on one! The drivers here barely stop when picking up new passengers. $11.89 9 p.m. — We get dinner at a sushi place, where I order French fries (which is weird). The fries are subpar but the translations of the sushi roll names into English make up for it. Against my better judgment, we head over to where all the bars are. We drink and play darts. $9.22 11:30 p.m. — We head to another, more lively bar. We drink a few fruity drinks and play more darts. Korea is a bit behind when it comes to music and no one here actually knows how to do ""The Cupid Shuffle,"" so my friend and I do it and the rest of the people at the bar fist pump. $11.06 3:30 a.m. — I finally leave the bar and hop in a taxi. I am impressed with the Korean taxi driver because he actually understands my Korean when I tell him my address. I get super tired in the taxi and look forward to crawling into my bed. Get home, take out my contacts, wash my face, and go straight to sleep. $14.32 Daily Total: $75.82",3,71
"10 a.m. — I do not feel good. Chug a ton of water and eat something to make myself feel better, which works. I cancel my afternoon plans so that I can take it easy. One of my best friends asks if we can talk on the phone. We talk for two hours and catch up on what has happened in the last three months since we last chatted. She tells me about her nightmare road trip with a friend from college and I tell her about my vacation and guy troubles. 12:20 p.m. — I remember I don't have coffee in my house and need to drink some before a headache sets in. Can't get motivated. I finally get myself ready to go out into public, pick up the coffee, and retreat back into my apartment. I feel 100 times better after drinking the coffee. I also make a quick lunch because I am strangely very hungry today. $5.99 3 p.m. — I think hard about going out and exercising, but do not move from my bed. I watch YouTube videos and text my friend about how lazy I'm feeling. It's okay to take it easy on a Sunday! 5:30 p.m. — Finally put all of my laundry away and start making dinner. I make a traditional Korean street food called Tteok-bokki — Korean rice cakes in a super spicy sauce. This batch I make is so spicy it makes me sweat and my tongue feels like it's going to fall off. I save the leftovers for lunch, but I fear that I'll start sweating at work when I eat them tomorrow. 9 p.m. — After a few hours of being lazy and watching , I decide to be a grandma and go to bed at 9:15. I felt like going to bed for the night at 3 p.m. today, so I think it's a good call to give my body what it wants. Daily Total: $5.99",4,71
"6:45 a.m. — Going to bed early last night was a smart move but I still feel like I could snooze for another two hours. I slowly get up and get into my pre-work routine. I was too lazy to make my lunch the night before, so I whip something up now. I get a call from the guy I declined dinner with the other night — a butt dial, he claims — and then he proceeds to ask how my weekend was. I leave later than usual. 8:45 a.m. — I roll into the office and get settled in for a long day of sitting at a desk. There are no English classes this week and everyone is gearing up for the last day of school. I have things to work on and online shopping to browse, so I keep pretty busy as I sip on my second cup of coffee. 11:30 a.m. — My co-teacher tells me it's time for lunch – an hour earlier than our usual lunchtime. We meander down to the cafeteria and, to my surprise, it's full of first and second graders. My heart melts because they're so cute! Luckily, my spicy leftovers don't make me sweat and I eat my lunch pretty quickly. 2 p.m. — I start thinking about how I'd like to get involved in volunteer work in Ulsan, so I do some research. I find an organization and shoot them a message. I browse online more and am quite surprised by how quickly time is passing today. In addition to the volunteering, I would also like to enroll in a Korean language class because living here and not knowing much Korean is a major missed opportunity. 4:40 p.m. — I try to get out of work as soon as possible and head straight to the gym. I feel super hungry and a little worried that my workout won't be great because I haven't eaten enough. I block out these thoughts and push my mile on the treadmill in record time; it feels easy. It really is all in your mind when it comes to pushing yourself at the gym. Unfortunately, I learned these no-B.S. mentality tricks long after I swam and ran in college and high school. 6 p.m. — I leave the gym and go to the store to pick up my grocery staples, and make a sweet potato, salad, and tofu back at home. I feel motivated, so I clean my apartment and put all of my clean clothes away. I don't know how I always end up with so many clothes to put away after only a few days! $18.32 9:30 p.m. — I wind down and listen to music. I watch an episode of e again and chat with a friend. 10 p.m. rolls around and I pass out with the plan of heading to the gym first thing in the morning. Daily Total: $18.32",5,71
"6:30 a.m. — Guess who didn't go to the gym this morning! I sleep another 15 minutes and then give my mom a quick call. Finally, I get up at 7:10 and start getting ready. I speedily get ready and have time to do chores around my house, and yet still head out the door a little late. 8:45 a.m. — No class again today, so I have to invent things to keep busy. I will try to sift through all of the tax information I have received to give to my mom, who is an angel and is helping me with my taxes while I'm overseas. One of my co-teachers is having a rough morning and I see her crying. The teachers here rotate the grades they teach every year, and she went from teaching fifth-grade English to first-grade homeroom. First grade is the very first year of Korean elementary school, so she will have to teach them all of the basics. I know she'll be great at it, but I wish I could make her feel less sad about the switch. 12:30 p.m. — We head to lunch. I feel like a bottomless pit today and leave unsatisfied after I finish my lunch. This leaves me a bit worried because I definitely did not pack sufficient snacks today. I try to pull myself together and forget about my stomach's rumbling by busying myself with work. 3 p.m. — I am wildly hungry and overall do not feel that well this afternoon. I need to reconsider the amount of food I bring to work. I take the last package of nuts in our office (and the only snack left) and munch on a banana. The last hour of work is dreadful – time seems to pass so slowly. My co-teacher tells me that we have a work dinner to celebrate the last day of the school year, but I decline because she tells me only 20 minutes before the day ends. I tell her I already have plans for the evening. 5:30 p.m — I skip the gym today because I really felt ill after work today. I start making dinner at home and listening to tunes. Tuesday nights are the best because I get to watch . I'm not too fond of Arie but I continue to watch this season because I live for reality TV. 9:30 p.m. — I am reverting back to my grandma ways this week and spend the night watching YouTube videos. Tell myself that I'm going to the gym in the morning and pack my gym bag to avoid any excuses! Daily Total: $0",6,71
"6:30 a.m. — I get up with a hint of reluctance and get ready for the gym. I pack my breakfast and lunch and then walk over. I am so happy to see how bright it is getting at 7 a.m. now; it is making me stoked for spring and summer and I need to get OUT of my winter slump. Hit back and biceps at the gym. I shower, curl my hair, and do my makeup at the gym before going to work. 8:35 a.m. — Immediately upon getting to work, I crack open my overnight oats. I am so hungry this morning. Make coffee in the office and realize I have the whole place to myself today. Luckily, tomorrow is the first day of a four-day weekend. I text a Korean friend about our plans to meet for dinner later. 1 p.m. — Honestly, I have no idea what I have done today, but time is passing quickly. Start chatting with a guy I met this summer – boredom at its finest. I have purposely left my wallet at home for the past two days because I sadly cannot trust myself with online shopping. Also, going to the gym this morning was a great idea because I haven't fallen into my post-lunch slumber. 5 p.m. — I run to the store to get food and go for a walk. I pick up pickles (a strange craving), apples, carbonated water, and Tteok-bokki. Surprisingly, I don't see any of my students on my walk to and from the store. I get home and redo my makeup and fix my hair before going out to dinner. I end up having a weird reaction to a product I use. Of course this happens right before I meet someone for the first time! $10.02 7:30 p.m. — So, so hungry. I meet a new Korean friend for dinner. We get pasta and pizza and chat about life in Korea, life in the U.S., languages, and gun control. We plan to play beer pong and darts at the local bar the next time we meet. He tells me that in Korea, it is customary to treat a new friend to dinner, so he pays the bill. I tell him I will buy him drinks when we meet next. 10:30 p.m. — I relax at home and chat with friends from the U.S. No work tomorrow, so I think about how much I can sleep in in the morning. And just like that, I fall asleep. Daily Total: $10.02",7,71
"11:05 a.m. — On the weekends, I like to take my time and ease into the day. I'm finally getting out of bed after scrolling through social media and browsing the web. It's such a bad habit to have in the morning, so I've been brainstorming better ways to start the day. I have plans to shop for groceries, do my hair, try to make D.I.Y. soap, and meal prep for the week. 11:36 a.m. — I receive a call from the Apple Store letting me know that the repair they did on my computer didn't fix the issue it had, so they need to factory reset my laptop to continue! Being naïve and thinking my computer just needed some simple fix, I didn't back it up. Over the last couple of years, I have been uploading all the pictures taken on my phone to my laptop and keeping somewhat of a photo diary. The photos hold such dear memories, especially of my little sister growing up and my amazing college times. I ask the Apple Store to stop what they are doing so that I can go get my laptop and try to salvage my data first. I become pretty emotional at the thought of losing those memories, and I get down on myself about not having backed up my computer first. 11:55 a.m. — I make steel-cut oatmeal and vent to my roommate about my computer situation. She's the best for hearing me out when I'm having these small breakdowns, and gives me a bit of hope that I can recover my data. 12:15 p.m. — My best friend calls to chat for a little while. After, I quickly do my skincare routine and throw on whatever is clean, plus a hat to cover my week-old braid out. 1:30 p.m. — I'm finally out the door but there is ice and snow covering my car, so I have to wait for it to defrost. A few minutes later, I stop by my leasing office to see the property manager about a late fee of $100 on our account, but she's not there. I have no idea what this is about – I always pay my rent on time every month. I leave a note with the staff asking the property manager to reach out so that I don't have to keep popping by the office. 2:14 p.m. — I go to Best Buy to purchase an external hard drive. Should have done this years ago! $60.81 2:50 p.m. — Arrive at the Apple Store where they tell me the bad news in person: Their fix was unsuccessful and my computer is having trouble rebooting. Before bringing it in for support, it took a while to reboot but it would at least turn on. I thought these people were tech geniuses! They suggest other places I can bring it to that might be able to recover my data before sending me on my way. I'm trying not to have a total fit and stay optimistic that someone, somewhere can help a sista out, but I'm infuriated. 3:57 p.m. — I stop by Trader Joe's while I'm downtown because there isn't one close to where I live in North Kansas City. It's super crowded and I'm truly not in the mood to deal with it. It's Sunday afternoon, so I should have known better. I grab onions, kiwis, potatoes, frozen pineapples, and basmati rice. $10.14 5:51 p.m. — I decide to go to the Sprouts because I do need groceries and I hope it'll be way less crowded. I should have come here in the first place – it's way calmer and I know exactly where everything I need is. I grab carrots, broccoli, cauliflower, pears, green and red bell peppers, cabbage, avocados, jalapeño peppers, spinach, bananas, blueberries, plantains (I've never cooked them before, but I'm excited to try), mangos, mushrooms, sweet potatoes, squash, alkaline water, coconut water, Thai curry paste, popcorn, black beans, tomato paste, Daiya vegan cheese, vegan yogurt, almonds, and garlic naan. $62.81 6:15 p.m. — I get home and unload my groceries while snacking on almonds and blueberries. As I unload, I listen to the podcast. I love how soothing their voices are and they always discuss amazing topics! 7:10 p.m. — Hop in the shower and wash and condition my hair. When I get out, I put my hair in a few big braids to let it air dry before I straighten it. My hair is naturally very curly and I've put heat on it about once a month, which has resulted in damaged, straight ends. I'm not ready to give up my flat iron — and I may never be because I love the versatility of my hair. I can wear it big and curly or it can be silky-straight! 7:30 p.m. — I try making sweet potato and black bean quesadillas and top them off with avocado and cilantro. I'm not vegan, but I consider myself to be a conscious eater. I've eliminated meat (except seafood) and dairy from my diet, but I don't beat myself up if I slip up. I'm only human — and my body has a harsh way of letting me know I messed up! 10:10 p.m. — Finally get around to blow-drying and straightening my hair. It's going to be a long night. I call one of my friends back who called me earlier, and then listen to the podcast. They have crazy ass stories on that show. 12:14 a.m. — Done with my hair and ready for bed! Throughout the process, I burn my hand with the wand curler and break my sink. Today has been a complete fail. Daily Total: $133.76",1,72
"6:30 a.m. — My alarm goes off, but I hit snooze three times and don't get out of bed until 7:15. I think I'm groggy  because my upstairs neighbors decided to have a screaming match around 3 a.m. I make a green smoothie for breakfast (spinach, celery, pineapples, lemons, coconut water, and blueberries) and grab a yogurt before leaving the house. 8:45 a.m. — On my way to work, a man came out of nowhere and sprinted across the highway! Thankfully, the road wasn't busy but he could have been seriously hurt. I settle into work and reply to a few emails, drink my smoothie, and have some Kite Hill Almond Milk Yogurt; it's only okay. I bought two different flavors, though, so maybe this peach one just isn't my jam. 11:04 a.m. — I snack on roasted and salted almonds and pumpkin seeds from home, but I'm really craving fries. 12:37 p.m. — I fulfill my desire and get a side of fries from the cafeteria at work to go with the sweet potato and black bean quesadillas from last night. They're soggy now but get the job done. I eat in front of my computer, like I do on most days. A few coworkers and. I occasionally walk to the café together and chat but there are often meetings right after lunch that we need to prep for. $2.06 1:38 p.m. — My leasing office calls to say they removed the $100 fee from my account. Apparently, they thought we underpaid rent by $5, but it was a mistake on their part. Damn right. 2:11 p.m. — I take a mental break from work to check social media and read a Money Diary. I also take my daily supplement cocktail: iron (I recently got blood work done, and my iron levels are below normal), B12, primrose oil, and Vitex berry. I started taking the berries to help balance my hormones. I've been suffering from some pretty bad hormonal acne and PMS, so I'm hoping this helps over time. I have acne-prone skin in general, but around my period it seems to get out of control. I have a dermatologist appointment coming up and am crossing my fingers. 5:35 p.m. — I get home and spend the next hour on social media, watching YouTube videos, and snacking on popcorn and blueberries. I'm in one of those lazy moods where I don't feel like cooking dinner but I need to eat. I still have some of the sweet potato and black bean mixture for quesadillas left, but I really don't want it. Until I decide, I turn on and try to troubleshoot my computer with Apple Support over the phone. 8:38 p.m. — After an hour and a half on the phone with Apple, there's still no fix. I schedule another call for Wednesday to do more troubleshooting and remain hopeful. 10:35 p.m. — Whenever I sit in my papasan chair, I have a hard time finding the energy to get out of it. It's so comfy! I get up to take a shower, do my skincare routine, do the dishes, and find something to eat. I settle on ramen noodles and throw together more quesadillas for tomorrow's lunch. I get in bed shortly after and fall asleep to . (Yes, I've watched all 14 seasons.) Daily Total: $2.06",2,72

I brush my teeth with a charcoal and turmeric mixture I got from Marshalls a few weeks ago and get ready for the day. Because of my acne and scarring, I have to throw on a layer of makeup every day. I hate feeling like I need to wear it, but until I get my situation together, I need the confidence boost. 8:45 a.m. — At work! While going through my emails, I eat my entire pint of blueberries. To think I use to hate these things growing up! I listen to the newest episode of the podcast as I start working on spreadsheets for my client. 10:57 a.m. — Walk down to the vending machine to buy a mid-morning snack with my coworker and we chat for a while. She's freaking out about Valentine's Day and how the guy she's currently dating is super flaky. I'm single as a dollar bill, so tomorrow is just another day. I grab a KIND bar! $2.76 12:53 p.m. — Get around to eating lunch while finishing up spreadsheets. 4:27 p.m. — We have a team happy hour tonight downtown and I rush to finish up the day's work to meet everyone at a pub. We get a round of beers on the manager's dime and I get a Boulevard on tap. I make small talk with my team (my biggest pet peeve is small talk, but I realize it's just one of those things you have to do) and contemplate leaving early. 5:36 p.m. — I end up staying awhile at the happy hour and walk over to another bar with arcade games. My manager buys a load of tokens, so I play skee-ball. One of my coworkersz usually pretty collected and it's funny to see how he really gets down. Another coworker wants to buy me a drink to reach the tab limit of $10, so I get another Boulevard and hang around for more team bonding. 8:20 p.m. — I'm home and starving! I've been craving vegetable curry with basmati rice lately. I throw together curry with broccoli, golden potatoes, peas, coconut milk, vegetable broth, turmeric, cumin, and a bunch of other seasonings for dinner. It comes out delicious even though I'm slightly tipsy and throwing things together. I'm proud! Daily Total: $2.76",3,72

I fall back asleep but wake up around 7:30, thankfully! 8:45 a.m. — I'm settling into work, catching up on emails, and eating a banana and almonds for breakfast. A guy I used to date in college texts me: ""Have a good day."" It dawns on me that it's Valentine's Day, and I'm not sure if this is some sort of encrypted message! I don't overthink it and just send a quick reply. 9:30 a.m. — I have a meeting with my manager and I'm anxious: I intend to ask if I can work remotely and I'm nervous about getting pushback. This idea has been brewing for a while and my lease is up in a few months, so now is the perfect time to bring it up. Honestly, I've been unhappy living in Kansas City for months now. Moving to the Midwest was a huge adjustment, and I have no family and very few friends here. There is a growing community of young Black professionals here, but there aren't a lot spaces for us to get together without discrimination or even sometimes violence. Plus, the winters here? No thanks! 10:15 a.m. — Meeting went well! My manager will let me know in the upcoming weeks if I can officially go remote. We have a potluck at my job today to celebrate the holiday, so I go to a local bakery between meetings to buy an assortment of cookies. $19.06 12 p.m. — I brought my lunch today just in case there was nothing at the potluck to fit my diet. I decide to leave my lunch in the fridge for tomorrow and eat the Greek salad, veggies, spinach dip, and pasta salad that I brought and I grab one of the cookies, too. I sit and eat with my teammates until my 1 p.m. call. 5:35 p.m. — I grab a brownie before leaving work and make it home in 20 minutes. I have another call with Apple, but after five minutes of troubleshooting on the phone, they just tell me they need to schedule another Genius Bar appointment. 6:15 p.m. — I FaceTime my mom to vent about my computer drama and to see how her day is going. She tells me she used the facial and massage package I bought her for Christmas and that she's literally glowing. Jealous; I'm glad someone is doing self-care today! We end up talking for about two hours, which is the usual for us. 8:47 p.m. — Hop in the shower, do my skincare routine, and heat up some curry and garlic naan. While eating, I buy a one-way ticket for a weekend trip I'm taking soon for one of my best friend's birthdays. Being miles away from friends and family gives me major FOMO sometimes, but I try to make the big events. I'll buy the return trip using airline points. $111.27 10:35 p.m. — In bed, I binge watch season 4 of and Google ways to fix my poor laptop. I'm trying not to give up hope but I'm beyond frustrated.

I spend time watching Sophia Roe's Instagram Live Stories because this girl is goals. She gives great skincare and diet advice. 2:56 p.m. — I'm getting sleepy and snack on almonds, pumpkin seeds, and another half of a cookie. Eating will help me stay awake, right? 6:40 p.m. — I go to my appointment with Geek Squad and they do a data recovery on my laptop! I transfer cash from my savings to my checking account to cover the charge. $100 7:30 p.m. — Home and exhausted. I eat the last bit of curry left and sink into my papasan chair for a few hours.

"6:15 a.m. — I set my alarm for 15 minutes earlier than usual because we have a huge meeting today and I don't want to be late. I try to look semi-professional and slick my hair back into a neat ponytail. I grab a banana and I'm out the door by 7:45. 8:35 a.m. — I'm low on gas, so I stop at a station near my office. I fill up and grab a water from inside. $34.56 11:30 a.m. — The meeting lasts for two hours, so I take an early lunch and grab something from the cafeteria. They don't have too many yummy options, so I get the chef special salad. It comes with green apples, strawberries, chickpeas, red onions, cucumbers, tomatoes, spinach, and a fruity vinaigrette. I'm not thrilled with the salad, but I get my greens in. I grab a bag of popcorn to snack on afterwards. $7.69 12:15 p.m. — I'm having lunch with my coworker who is going to St. Louis this weekend. I tell her that I heard there's construction on the highway on the way there that could cause a delay, and she is so thankful for the information that she buys me sweet potato tots, lol! 1:37 p.m. — I decide to head home to finish up work, and listen to my all-time favorite podcast, during the car ride. Podcasts definitely help me get through the day. 5:06 p.m. — I'm still working when my roommate gets home. She's been out of town this whole week so we catch up on work and our personal lives for the next few hours. I'm too lazy to make dinner or order take out, so I whip up guacamole and call it a night. 10:07 p.m. — I'm all bundled up like a baby in bed, watching the last few episodes of .

"6:12 a.m. — Of course, my body actually wakes up on time when I don't have to go to work. I lay in bed for a while and read my book. Malala Yousafzai's story is one I will never forget. She has faced so much adversity and still stands up for her rights despite constant threats. I'm almost brought to tears by the stories she shares in this book. 8:30 a.m. — I'm out of bed and decide to go to a fitness class at a local gym, grabbing almonds on my way out. I'm the only one that shows up to the class, so I get my ass kicked. I should have eaten more before coming because I have zero energy and I'm so out of shape. My body is not happy with me and I realize I need to get back on track. My trainer has a yoga class tomorrow and invites me to come for free at her other gym! $7 11:05 a.m. — I'm back home and starving. I eat a mango while making another green smoothie. Knowing that I'll still be hungry after, I make a mushroom-and-roasted potato hash with zucchini, onions, and bell peppers. 12:30 p.m. — I spend the afternoon cleaning and listening to radio! I mentally start throwing together an outfit to wear to see tonight. I'm so excited to see it – everybody has been talking about it! 5:37 p.m. — My roommate and I decide to go a crab boil restaurant that just opened a few months ago. As I walk in, everyone's plates look so good, and I decide to get the large plate with two crab clusters, shrimp, potatoes, and corn with Cajun seasoning. This was probably the best decision I've made all week – it's so delicious. The owner is super friendly and even gives use both a free serving of shrimp for trying out the restaurant. They have won me over! $29.87 6:43 p.m. — The movie theater is only 10 minutes away from the restaurant but parking is so bad in the city today – apparently because a cheer competition is in town. We find a decent parking spot about three blocks away. My friend buys popcorn and I sneak a few handfuls throughout the movie. I give her the money for my movie ticket, since she bought them online a few weeks ago. $13 9:18 p.m. — WAKANDA!!! OMG. is a must-see. So many awesome themes, and the action scenes are fantastic. An all-Black superhero movie that has already broken multiple records brings me so much joy. I don't want to include any spoilers, but there is nice eye candy in the movie as well. Geek Squad calls and leaves a voicemail while I am in the movie to tell me that the data on my hard drive is unreadable. I officially give up on this mission to recover my data. 9:45 p.m. — My roommate and I walk over to Insomnia Cookies and the line is absurd.

"5 a.m. — It's Monday and my alarm goes off. I wake up this early to get in some GMAT studying before work – I'm on the waitlist at my top choice school and am retaking the exam so that I can hopefully make it off the waitlist. Out of the four schools I applied to, I was accepted to one and waitlisted at three. I enjoy getting up early and starting my day productively, but I am looking forward to getting this test over soon – finally, a light at the end of this 14-month tunnel! I chug a glass of warm water with lemon (like I do every morning), but it doesn't go down well for some reason. I eat two eggs with Sriracha for an energy boost. 8 a.m. — Wrap up studying and put on The New York Times's podcast and then NPR's . No time to linger since I need to be in the office before 9 today to prep for the weekly sales meeting. I brush my teeth and wash my face before getting dressed. I bring my boyfriend his breakfast of peanut butter, Nutella, and sliced bananas on potato bread. I make a point to make him a sandwich in the morning because his Mondays are packed with meetings and he doesn't have time to sneak in a bite at the office. I pack up the grilled chicken ranch wraps I meal prepped yesterday, kiss him goodbye, and head downtown to my office. During my commute, I put on and catch up on political news. 8:58 a.m. — Arrive at the office with two minutes to spare! I make myself a cup of green tea and join the meeting. Every Monday it's the same drill: not enough sales and we need more business. This company is the definition of a boy's club. One of the things I wrote about in my business school applications was the need for women to be more visible in male-dominated industries and to have more of a support system. 12 p.m. — Out of the meeting just in time to jump on a client discovery call. This client found us through a Google search and I need to run through a list of questions to ensure our product is the right solution for his firm. The call goes well and we schedule a follow up demo for him to review our products. I eat yogurt with a banana for breakfast that I brought from home while sending out emails. 1 p.m. — I'm starving, so I go to the kitchen and heat up my chicken wrap. I also have two dark chocolate Hershey's Kisses and a handful of almonds from my snack drawer stash. 2 p.m. — I'm feeling sleepy so I get up to take a walk to keep from falling asleep.

Lots of questions and follow up items. Sigh. The deal definitely won't close this month. 5 p.m. — Leave the office and walk over to the SoulCycle studio a couple blocks away. I make it in time for a 5:30 class with one of my favorite instructors. Her music mashups are on point and I always walk away sore but smiling. Each time I go, I rent shoes and get a water for $5. I figure it evens out, though, since I bring my lunch to work every day. $37 7 p.m. — Stop by the market underneath my apartment building and pick up a baguette, a loaf of potato bread, bananas, kale, basil, tomatoes, pepperoni, spicy turkey, lemons, frozen tater tots, and Swiss cheese.

I bake tater tots, too, and then my boyfriend and I eat dinner while watching . I never got into the show when it first came out so I'm going through the series for the first time.

Rush to the subway because I'm trying to make a 5:30 hot vinyasa class in midtown. I've been going to Yoga to the People for the past four years. When I moved away from the city for six months, it was one of the things I missed most. I get their monthly unlimited class pass and try to come twice a week. I rent a mat and towel and buy water before settling in for two hours of class. $5 8 p.m. — Leave the studio feeling refreshed!

Make my boyfriend his usually peanut butter banana sandwich and one for myself and then head to work. 9 a.m. — I send out 50 cold emails for work. 12 p.m. — Today's lunch is again chicken wrap with ranch. I usually meal prep on Sunday so lunch for the week is the same every day. I find that as long as I switch it up week to week, I don't get sick of the food. One of the guys on the project management team just got back from Canada and brought maple cookies. I eat two and chat with him about his trip. I learned that he was in Canada visiting his wife's family. This guy is two years younger than me and has been married for a year. It's crazy how different people's lives are. 5 p.m. — Dash out the door and head home. I change into workout clothes and walk to the gym near my apartment. I walk one mile and then run four on the treadmill while watching .

Venmo request my boyfriend for half. $32.50 8 p.m. — Shower and then listen to the podcast while making gnocchi with pesto and kale salad with lemon-shallot dressing. I put the baked clams in the oven and pour myself a glass of wine. For dessert, I layer the graham crackers with sliced bananas and top it all off with Siggi's drinkable yogurt and cinnamon for a healthier version of banana pudding. My boyfriend jumps on a conference call and I make silly faces at him while he's talking. 9 p.m. — My boyfriend is finally off his conference call and we sit down for our meal. I baked way too many stuffed clams and now we'll have leftover for days. Everything was delicious and we're both way too full, but of course there's always room for dessert! We each have a bowl of banana pudding and I head to bed. My boyfriend stays up late working, but I eat melatonin gummies and fall asleep. Daily Total: $32.50",3,73

My boyfriend was not as quiet as he thought he was when he came to bed at 4 a.m. I got woken up because I'm a light sleeper, hence why I need the melatonin. I chug warm lemon water and attempt to study. 7 a.m. — Today's just not my day. I'm trying to study but I'm just not comprehending the words. I decide to take a break and watch Peggie Neo's Mukbang. It's a Korean-style eating show, which  at first I thought was ridiculous but after watching a few episodes on Youtube, I can't stop. Watching makes me hungry so I make a packet of Asha healthy ramen with two eggs and then order another five packs of it on Amazon. $10 9 a.m. — Get to the office and it's a ghost town.

I try to get up every hour to socialize with coworkers. 5 p.m. — Leave the office and head to a Rumble class. It's a 45-minute HIIT/boxing class that has water bags instead of sandbags, which are supposedly better for your knuckles.

Plus all the instructors are hot, the music is great, and the locker rooms are stocked with beauty products. $39 7 p.m. — Shower and then get a text from my friend who's hanging out at a bar in Hell's Kitchen. I'm a sucker for a $5 frozen margarita so I Uber over. It's packed but we grab a table. My friend fills me in on the latest gossip at his office (where I used to work). We're two drinks in when I realize I'm starving. We order loaded nachos, pulled pork sandwiches, and sliders. The food tastes amazing because I'm buzzed and we inhale everything in 10 minutes.

Seriously thinking about calling in sick but decide against it since I'm taking two days off next week. 8:30 a.m. — I begrudgingly get dressed and head out. Grab a bacon, egg, and cheese on an everything bagel from a coffee shop next to the office.

I show my monthly membership card and then rent a mat and towel. $4 2 p.m. — Get home, shower, and eat a Cadbury fruit and nut chocolate bar, which my boyfriend brought back from his recent London trip. I sit down and start a four-hour GMAT practice test that I purchased from the MBA website. $60 8:30 p.m. — After reviewing my errors, I'm finally done with studying for the day! I decide to make sushi for dinner so I head to the market to grab tuna steak, wasabi, avocado, and pickled ginger. I recently learned how to make sushi and it's surprisingly easy and a lot cheaper than ordering from Seamless. I make six rolls: three spicy tuna and three California. $19.50 9:30 p.m. — Dinner is served and I have a glass of wine with my delicious homemade sushi. One of my goals for this year was to cook more and eat out less. So far, we've only ordered delivery once in three weeks. The wines I've been drinking are from the WSJwine Club. I got a case of 12 wines as a Christmas present and have been making my way through the reds. 11 p.m. — Read in bed with my boyfriend and start Sunday's crossword. Daily Total: $83.50",6,73
"10 a.m. — Decide to go to the gym before breakfast. I run on the treadmill for 60 minutes while watching . Then I stretch and head home, picking up two venti iced chais from Starbucks on the way. I shower and heat up leftover French toast for breakfast with yogurt. $15.34 12 p.m. — Sit down and study for the GMAT. It's frustrating getting the same questions wrong over and over again and not being able to find a satisfactory explanation for the correct answer. I eat more Cadbury chocolate and continue. 5 p.m. — Feeling burnt out, I decide to call it quits for the day since I will be resuming in 12 hours. I make kale salad with lemon-shallot dressing and heat up leftover pizzas for dinner. 6 p.m. — My boyfriend has conference calls until 8 so I decide to meal prep and make chocolate pecan blondies while waiting for him to finish. Run down to the market and grab King Arthur white whole wheat flour, chocolate chips, butter, pecans, vanilla extract, baguette, mixed greens, and tofu. I roast the tofu in BBQ sauce and make four tofu sandwiches with the baguette and mixed greens. I bake the blondies and decide to bring half to the office for my coworkers tomorrow. $35.60 8:20 p.m. — My boyfriend finally finishes his calls and we have dinner and watch . He is very excited about the blondies so he gives me a bear hug and several wet smooches. He always works late on Sunday nights so I say goodnight and head to bed without him. 9:30 p.m. — I finish my book in bed and then order Celeste Ng's ($14.52) on Amazon for my next read, along with four bottles of melatonin gummies. Set alarm for 5 a.m. and then lights are out by 11. $74.48 Daily Total: $125.42",7,73
"8 a.m. — My boyfriend's alarm goes off. (Side note: Even though we're engaged, I usually just refer to him as my boyfriend.) He jumps straight out of bed (how?) and potters around getting ready. I promptly go back to sleep. Say goodbye to him, then snooze for a little bit longer. 10:30 a.m. — I justify sleeping this late because I'm fighting off a near-constant sinus infection. For breakfast I have a bowl of overnight oats, which I make in bulk most weekends. This week's huge batch contains blueberries, bananas, chia seeds, oats, coconut yoghurt, almond milk, and leftover flax seeds. I eat while sitting in front of my SAD lamp (for Seasonal Affective Disorder).  I'm prone to Vitamin D-deficiency, so I've borrowed my mum's light to see if it helps me feel better in the winter. 11 a.m. — Today is Book Day. Most weeks, I work on a self-imposed schedule of three days freelance copywriting followed by two days of work on my novel. Without it, it can be all too easy to neglect the novel, as it (currently) doesn't make me any money. This week, I moved my book days to the beginning so that I can work on sending chapters to an agent before the end of the month – eek! Before I start, though, I have a bit of wedmin (wedding admin) to do. My boyfriend and I have been engaged for five-and-a-half years and have finally decided to get the wedding ball rolling. I bought a dress last week, and we're trying to tie down a venue now. 2 p.m. — Time has seriously run away from me. After some heavy wedmin, a chat on the phone with my mum, and lunch consisting of a big bowl of roasted veggies, quinoa, and hummus (homemade in bulk; our hummus consumption is too vast to justify buying it), I finally make my way into my pseudo-office. Then, I Uber to the dry cleaners with the aforementioned wedding dress. (It was a sample sale purchase, so it was recommended that I get it cleaned). $16.36 3 p.m. — Get to the dry cleaners and it turns out it's going to cost over $190 for the clean! This is more than double what the bridal store estimated, but I saved so much on the dress that it should still work out as a good deal over all. I hand over my card, feeling a little sick and a little too flustered to question the cost. On the way out, I decide I'll bring it up when I collect the dress. $196 3:30 p.m. — Stop to grab coffees for me and my boyfriend. I get access to the shared workspace that I use as an office through his work (and it's free!), and his office happens to be in the same building. We chat for a couple of minutes after I give him the coffee, and then I settle in for some writing while munching on a homemade cookie. (I used a cookie recipe from Lucy Watson's cookbook and was initially skeptical of buying a cookbook written by a reality TV star, but these cookies are SO GOOD. They're vegan but they don't taste it). $7 6 p.m. — Multiple breaks throughout the afternoon for snacks (lentil chips and then peanut butter and banana) and random internet browsing. 6:45 p.m. — Meet my friend for salsa class. We signed up a few weeks ago, inspired by our New Year's resolutions. As a socially awkward person with no coordination, dance class is a challenge for me, plus it's an additional expense, but it's good for my mental health. It's actually quite fun and I get see to see my friend on a weekly basis, which is lovely. I have a splitting headache when I arrive but hope I'll forget about it once we start. 8:30 p.m. — Head home after an hour of dancing very close to people I don't know and making awkward small talk with a fellow classmate. Still, it was fun and my headache is gone. My friend and I walk to the Tube while discussing how nice it is to spend time in class where you can't check your phone or really think about anything other than the choreography. We hug and make plans to hang out in a week or so. I spend the rest of the journey thinking about the bagel I'm going to make when I get home while also indulging my inner emo teenager by listening to 30 Seconds To Mars. (I recently discovered I love them. Jared Leto is a beautiful man. I have no shame.) $8 9:30 p.m. — I mooch about the house while I wait for my boyfriend to get back from football – I said I'd wait for him to eat, as he hasn't had dinner yet either. Chuck a load of washing in and feed Gerty, my sourdough starter. We were given a sourdough class for Christmas, and it was there that Gerty was born. For the next week, I have to feed it water and flour before I can use it (her? - the teacher heavily anthropomorphized her own starter, and now I feel the need to as well) to bake. My boyfriend gets home and we have bagels — his with avocado and goat's curd, and mine with avocado and vegan cream cheese. We watch old episodes of while we polish off the last of the cookies, and then get to bed around 11. Daily Total: $227.36",1,74
"9 a.m. — Boyfriend yells from the kitchen so I drag myself out of bed to see what's so exciting. Our sourdough starters have doubled in size overnight and look like tiny bready monsters. He leaves, and I eat oats for breakfast while watching . Spend the morning reading up on the best way to approach agents for my novel. 11 a.m. — Grab a quick shower and douse myself in the last of the Glossier perfume tester I had. Fortuitously, it arrived just as I ran out of my regular perfume. It's cheaper than my usual and smells lovely, so I decide to order a full bottle online. $63 12:30 p.m. — Another portion of roasted veggies, quinoa and hummus for lunch. Watch another episode of , then do a quick Headspace meditation. (I can keep my anxiety much more under control if I meditate everyday.) Check the sourdough starters and notice Gerty is bursting out of her plastic container. Hurriedly transfer her into a bigger jar before she explodes everywhere. 1 p.m. — Wander to my favourite coffee shop and am chuffed to get my usual seat, nestled away in a little nook at the back. Order a coffee which comes with a biscuit (this place is the best), and get to work on editing and writing. I was planning to contact book agents soon, but all the advice I read earlier has convinced me of the need to do one more, fine-tooth comb-through of my book before sending the first chapters off. $3.40 3:30 p.m. — Starting to get peckish. The cafe doesn't have any vegan cakes, so I panic and order another coffee I don't really need just so I can have the biscuit. Fun fact: Lotus biscuits are vegan. (I'm not strictly vegan but have noticed my skin and mental health are better when I avoid dairy, so I tend to follow a vegan diet most of the time.) $3.40 4:10 p.m. — My attention is lagging a little. I'm trying very hard not to just rewrite everything in the book, which is what I've done on each of my previous three edits. I decide to get my second coffee to-go to have tomorrow and then head home. On the way, I stop at a bookstore to do research – I want to have a look at how successful fantasy authors start their books and to get an idea of how long their chapters are. I spend a bit of time flicking through some novels, including  , and my absolute favourite fantasy series, by Robin Hobb. Reading Hobb was what inspired me to finally start working on my own book, so looking over her first trilogy now is oddly nostalgic and emotional. 5 p.m. — Snack on homemade rye bread with a little vegan cream cheese while I watch . Almost immediately cut another slice and have it with honey. Finish with a few lentil chips. Spend an hour or so on the phone with my mum and then my nan. 7 p.m. — Boyfriend texts to say he's on his way home and inquires about our dinner plans. Usually, on nights when he's home a little later, it's my turn to cook – and vice versa. Our weekly Gousto box arrived earlier today so we have three meals to choose from, but I'm beginning to feel pretty tired, so I suggest leftovers. I lie around until he gets home, and then we snack on rye bread with a yummy sheep's cheese. Feel a little better after eating. 9 p.m. — Remember we need to feed the sourdough starters. I do so while wishing Gerty was actually a small fluffy animal instead of a jar full of fermenting yeast, but you can't have everything. 11 p.m. — I go to bed but feel surprisingly awake. I want to read but I know I'll get sucked in and not be able to stop. Manage to resist the urge, toss and turn for a bit, eventually fall asleep, and end up dreaming about the book I didn't read.

"6 a.m. — My boyfriend's alarm goes off at an unholy hour, but I barely even register it. All I notice is the vague buzzing of the sound trying to break into my comfy-ness and the fact that it's still dark outside. I'm pretty sure he showers, but either he's gotten very good at getting ready quietly or I've gotten great at sleeping through the noises, as I hear nothing. 10 a.m. — I set my alarm for 9 but inexplicably end up snoozing for an extra hour. Prat about on my phone for a bit, then get up. Breakfast is oats and SAD light (again) while watching . Then, I decide I'm going to work on my book. Technically, it should be a freelance day, but I'm waiting on work requests from my clients so I don't have any projects to work on right now. I could (and probably should) use the time to look for other work, but I'm feeling in the flow with my novel and want to try and power through as much as possible. I'll make up for it with an extra day of freelancing next week. 12 p.m. — Quick break to speak to my nan. She rings up to very kindly offer to pay for my wedding dress. I absolutely wish I could refuse all offers of help for things like this, as I'm very grateful for all my family has done for me and would like to be in the position to give them something back, but unfortunately, my boyfriend and I don't have the money to pay for everything wedding-related ourselves. I try to refuse my nan's offer, but she insists. I'm very grateful and promise her a big hug at the weekend. 1 p.m. — Decide it's probably time to get dressed. I'm going out to dinner tonight with my boyfriend and his coworkers, so I decide to wear a green & Other Stories dress I got a couple of Christmases ago. I love this dress but don't wear it that much, as it always needs ironing and I'm very lazy. I get out the ironing board and whiz the iron over while I talk to my mum on the phone about plans for this weekend; we're visiting her and my dad while also checking out a couple of potential wedding venues. Then I make a bagel with vegan cream cheese and avocado for lunch, being very careful not to spill on my newly ironed dress, before getting back to writing. 2:30 p.m. — Coffee break. Dress is creased. Already. What even is the point of ironing? Urgh. Make a coffee using my Nespresso – I usually brew with a V60, but I'm out of beans so I have to go with my backup. Take a quick online survey to try and qualify for paid market research. I do these as often as I can, as you can get paid over $70 for them, which is a great supplement to my freelance income. 5:30 p.m. — Do a quick meditation, then have a ten-minute rest before heading out to get the train to Central London. Meeting my boyfriend at his office. $3.65 6:30 p.m. — It's freezing! We walk from the office to a cute, gastropub-type place that sources its meat and fish locally. Get to know boyfriend's colleagues over bread and wine, then I have a starter of halloumi and butternut squash followed by pollock. Boyfriend has rabbit mac and cheese to start, then shares a colossal steak with one of his coworkers. The food is yummy but I start to feel sick halfway through my main (what is wrong with me at the moment?), so I get the rest in a box to take home. $107.80 9:30 p.m. — We head to a nearby cocktail bar with a speakeasy vibe that is nestled among a bunch of townhouses. The fresh air makes me feel better and much less sick. I have a rum and lime concoction followed by a smoky, barrel-aged rum drink that I order mostly for the smell. Boyfriend has two of the smoky ones, followed by half of mine, as I start feeling sick again. $71.56 10:30 p.m. — It's cold and dark so my boyfriend decides he wants to Uber home. He puts it on his credit card. We get back and I remember I was wearing foundation, so I have to pay more attention to removing all my makeup. Before my boyfriend passes out, we discuss the fact that we've spent quite a lot of money. It isn't ideal, but it was a special occasion, as one of the girls who was at dinner is relocating at the end of this week and we both think it's really important to make time for friends. Plus, we don't do it that often. Daily Total: $183.01",3,74
"10 a.m. — Usual routine of waking up, saying bye to my boyfriend, then conking out again. Really must get out of this habit. I eventually drag myself out of my warm bed and make porridge for breakfast. Given my odd, sick-y feeling, I decide to just leave it plain. 1 p.m. — Have a hectic morning trying to organise bits and bobs, including a potential Secret Cinema trip with a group of friends. The only tickets available are $110 a pop, which seems far too steep. I leave it and lament the time wasted. I accept that it's going to be one of those days where I don't have time to get much done, especially given we'll be driving down to my parents' house later. Have a quick lunch of peanut butter on a wholemeal bagel, a stick of vegan cheese, and freshly ground (by me) coffee in front of the SAD lamp. Then I jump on the train. $5.89 3:20 p.m. — I pop into my boyfriend's office to meet the most adorable little puppy who belongs to a coworker. I want to take him home, even though he threatens to snag my cosy jumper with his tiny teeth. Grab a coffee ($3.40) as I can't be arsed to grind any more beans when I get home, then head to the dry cleaners' to collect my wedding dress. The nice man working there assures me I didn't overpay and shows me the prices of a few other comparable dresses. Grab an Uber to avoid getting my newly-cleaned dress all grimey from the Tube, and am home $17.20 later (this'll go onto the wedding budget eventually, as it's technically a related expense). $20.60 5 p.m. — Get in an hour or so of writing before my boyfriend arrives home. Quickly pack far too many items of clothing for a long weekend, and jump in the car to set off. 7 p.m. — Feels like we've been driving for yeaaaaars. London traffic is the worst. Stop to get food  and we share vegetarian nachos with beans, cheese, and guac and veggie chili from one of the service station shops. Not great, but not as horrible as I expected ($10.79). I also grab a bag of my absolute favourite car snacks, spiral salt and vinegar crisps from M&S, along with a bottle of water, as we've drunk the one we filled up ($3.44). Boyfriend claims to hate the crisps but helps me demolish them within five minutes. We won't make it all the way to Devon on the petrol we have but don't want to pay for a whole tank at extortionate service prices, so we fill up enough to get us there ($28.06). $42.29 10 p.m. — Finally arrive at my parent's house. They greet us in a flurry of excitement and immediately whisk me upstairs so I can show them my wedding dress. We chill and catch up for a little bit but everyone's tired, so we head to bed around 11. I proceed to have a moderate panic attack for no reason I can discern, and watch until my brain shuts off enough to sleep. Daily Total: $68.78",4,74
"7:30 a.m. — Hear my dad say goodbye, which means that it's time to get up. I feel absolutely horrendous, and am not sure if it's a hangover from last night's anxiety or something physical. The joys of GAD. I manage one piece of buttered toast for breakfast and my lovely mum packs me one for later. Quickly feed Gerty (yes, we're the people who carry our sourdough starters around the country), dump half a can of dried shampoo over my head, and we're out the door by 8:30. 8:45 p.m. — Stop for petrol at Tesco as we have a voucher, but my boyfriend pays at the pump and forgets to use it – whoops! We get on the road properly and I attempt to sleep off whatever it is that's ailing me. I wake up feeling better, and eat the piece of toast Mum packed for me. $69.47 10:45 p.m. — Cornwall is so pretty! We make our way down windy little roads and through cute villages to the first of the wedding venues we're viewing today. It's an impressive-looking country house with a driveway a mile long, and we're suitably wowed. There's even an old Georgian bathhouse to have the ceremony in. The inside isn't as nice as the outside, though, and it's a little more expensive than we first thought it would be, so we leave with a lot to think about. Drive through the deer park(!) on the way out, and coo over all the sweet animals. 12 p.m. — Quick lunch before our next viewing. We're both starving and find a pub just off the main road. I get a winter club sandwich, which consists of turkey, bacon, cheese, stuffing, and cranberry sauce (goodbye Veganism), and my boyfriend gets a pork bap – plus we share chips. $25.96 1:45 p.m. — The next place we're viewing is an actual working farm, complete with chickens, pigs, and cows. We're shown the venue, plus the two barns which would be used on the day, and are told that all of the food would be made in-house using ingredients that are grown or bred on the farm. It's beautiful and has a really nice, homey vibe that really suits us. My boyfriend is sold and totally in love with it, and after a little discussion, I agree. We're quite budget-conscious too, and it would be a bargain for a last-minute, midweek date in September. 3 p.m. — We stop and grab a coffee to-go, plus a bottle of water. We decide to text our closest friends and make sure they're free on the date we're considering for the farm wedding, and I email the venue to provisionally hold it. $4.63 5 p.m. — Back home! I'm supposed to be taking part in a paid research interview online, but I dial into it only to be told it's cancelled. Luckily, they tell me they'll still pay me the full compensation, which is a massive bonus. 6 p.m. — We spend the evening chatting to my parents about the venue and discussing plans/ideas for the wedding in general. It's all becoming very real, very fast! We get fish and chips from the local chippy, which has recently been named best in the U.K. (apparently). Parents very kindly pay. We all conk out at around 11. Daily Total: $100.06",5,74
"8:30 a.m. — We're planning to drive to my nan's, who lives an hour away, for the rest of the weekend, so we get up, shower, pack, and head out. No petrol needed this time! 12:30 p.m. — Get to my nan's and everyone is famished. She makes us ham and cheese rolls with leftover Christmas chutney and we devour them. Then, it's time to show her the wedding dress. She approves, which I'm very pleased about. We have a lot of strong, fierce women on my mum's side of the family and we're all very close, so she will likely be involved in the wedding almost as much as my mum will be. 2 p.m. — There's a mother-of-the-bride shop that we've always admired quite close to my nan's house, so we decide to head over for a browse, now that we're actually planning a wedding. We meet my two cousins there, along with their other nan who is basically part of our family. There are loads of amazing things in the store, and we dash around pulling out dresses for my mum and nan to try. Mum isn't feeling it, but my nan gets the most gorgeous beaded, Art Deco-style dress that looks like it's made for her. We all get a bit teary, and I take the opportunity to ask my cousins to be bridesmaids. I don't have any siblings, and, as I said, our family is quite close, so they're probably the nearest people I have to sisters. 4 p.m. — Tired out from the emotions following my nan's purchase, we head over the road for a hot drink and sit down. Everyone except me gets hot chocolate, and I have a peppermint tea. My cousins' other nan sneakily pays and I give her all the change I have to cover my and my mum's drinks. $4.21 6 p.m. — We get home, show my dad and boyfriend my nan's dress, and then my boyfriend and I Facetime his parents to tell them about the quickly moving plans. (When I started this Money Diary, I did not expect it to essentially become a diary of wedding planning!) My youngest cousin and her new boyfriend arrive, and we all decide to order Indian food. My boyfriend and I get vegetable biryani, aubergine, cauliflower and mushroom bhajis, and peshwari naan to share. It's really yummy. Mum and dad pay, and I intend to pay them back for our share but totally forget to mention it. Will have to message them and transfer the money. 11 p.m. — After more chatting, it's bedtime. We're sleeping in the conservatory and it's freezing, so I layer up and we climb into bed with a hot water bottle. Daily Total: $4.21",6,74
"9 a.m. — Manage to sleep until 9 and then have toast and jam for breakfast. Have a minor panic that I haven't been paying Gerty much attention until I realise it's time for her to chill in the fridge for a week, according to our expert teacher. She's in the back of the car, which is basically a fridge anyway. 12 p.m. — Everyone is coming over for lunch today. My two cousins, the one boyfriend, and the additional nan all arrive, and we sit down to a roast featuring the biggest joint of beef I've ever seen. My parents actually got it for Christmas, but we had so much food then that it ended up in the freezer. I load up a plate with veggies, beef, and the all important Yorkshire puds. We follow it with three types of dessert: toffee pavlova roulade, lemon meringue pie, and Viennetta, all with ice cream. I roll away from the table feeling stuffed. 3:30 p.m. — We catch up more over coffee, then get back on the road to head back to London. We fill up with petrol (again), and I grab a packet of crisps because I'm a greedy monster. Stop for a wee halfway through the journey and manage not to buy any snacks. $55.87 6:30 p.m. — We go straight to our friends' house and I promptly put on PJs; usually I'd go for tracksuit bottoms but all I have are PJs from the weekend. Plus, we all lived together at university and visit one another's house on an almost weekly basis, so the time for dressing up has long since passed. I help one of the guys make bread-and-butter pudding while the others decide to order Japanese food. I realise I've eaten more takeout than not this week, which is definitely not usual. My boyfriend and I order California rolls, vegetable dumplings, prawn Katsu rolls, and tuna maki to share. One of the guys pays and will put our share on Splitwise, the app we use to keep track of monies within the group. We'll either pay it later or it'll cancel out against something else we've paid for. We end up severely under-ordering and are very grateful for the huge helping of bread-and-butter pudding we have for dessert. 11 p.m. — We play board games after dinner. Between us all in this group, we probably own over 50 of them. Tonight, we play the next installment of Pandemic Legacy Season 2, a game that continues on each time you play. When we're finished, we drive back to our place with one of the guys in tow – he and my boyfriend are planning to watch the Super Bowl. I potter around, unpacking a little and transferring Gerty to the fridge, and consider joining them. Watch for ten minutes before I decide I'm too knackered, and I end up going to bed around midnight. 4 a.m. — Boyfriend comes in after the Super Bowl is over and our friend has Ubered home. He sets an alarm for 10, which I think is somewhat ambitious, and I decide I'm very glad I didn't stay up watching the game. Daily Total: $55.87",7,74
"8 a.m. — It's the weekend, so I get to wake up without an alarm! I feed the dog and take him out, brush my teeth, chug water, then change into yoga clothes and do a 20-minute Yoga With Adriene video. I love her, and the session makes my stiff knees feel a million times better. 8:45 a.m. — I go downstairs to make breakfast and see that my boyfriend, S.*, is back from his weekly grocery/bakery/Starbucks run. We have different eating habits, so we shop separately most of the time. He got me a scone at the bakery but I decide to save it for later in favor of my usual oats, almond butter, fruit, hemp seeds, pumpkin seeds, and cinnamon combination. I also boil some water for tea. I spent way too much money on tea recently and am slowly working my way through my stash before allowing myself to buy any more. I am a tea fiend! S. and I watch a few episodes of on Netflix while I eat. 10:45 a.m. — It's time for me to leave for my biweekly therapy appointment. I really like my therapist and am so relieved to have finally found a good fit. Therapy, yoga, and a small dosage of medication really help to keep my once-debilitating anxiety and depression at bay. I am thrilled to find out I have a small copay today as I've just met my deductible for the year! $10 12 p.m. — I arrive back home to find the house empty. S. and his dad have gone to Home Depot to get more supplies for the sliding barn door they're trying to install in our dining room. I decide to eat my bakery scone, which does nothing for my hunger, so I preheat the oven for a frozen pizza. S.'s sister got us a Blue Apron gift card for Christmas, and the shipment arrived while I was at therapy but I'm saving it for dinners later in the week. While the oven is preheating, I make sure to cancel my Blue Apron membership because mama can't afford this stuff every week! 12:45 p.m. — Pizza is done and S. and his dad are back. I take my food upstairs to keep the dog company so he doesn't get in the way while they work. I catch up on a few episodes of . 3:30 p.m. — It's time to leave to grab my friend to go see . She's already seen it but wants to see it again. We both use our Movie Passes. I buy a small root beer at the concession stand. $4.50 6:15 p.m. — Movie was amazing but twisted! My friend feels like eating pancakes, so we decide to go to Bob Evans for brinner. I get two pancakes, scrambled eggs, and bacon, and it hits the spot. We catch up on life and really enjoy ourselves despite the snail-paced service. $8.83 7:45 p.m. — I drop off my friend and spend the short drive home soaking up more of my audiobook: . I'm on the last chapter and have thoroughly loved it. I make a mental note to grab the next volume in the series at work on Monday. 8 p.m. — I am back home and take the dog out for one last relief before locking up for the night. S. and I sit on the couch for a bit and I fill him in on the movie. I start getting a headache (and then realize I haven't had a single vegetable today, whoops) and we decide to head to bed. I wash my face, moisturize, brush my teeth, and pass out. Daily Total: $23.33",1,75
"8 a.m. — This just seems to be the time my body wakes up when I don't have to set an alarm. I feed and let out the dog and realize I'm too hungry to do yoga, so I save that for later and make my oats. 9 a.m. — S. and I decide to put off our Sunday responsibilities and go to the coffee shop where my sister works to hang out for a little bit. We used to go every Sunday, but the holidays and my work schedule made things wonky. Unfortunately, his car won't start and it's blocking mine in, so we go back inside to wait for AAA. I throw a load of laundry in the washer and sit down to write my grocery list for the week. 9:45 a.m. — AAA arrives and thinks something is wrong with the starter, so they leave for other jobs and say they'll be back to tow it to the shop in about an hour. I make kukicha (Japanese twig tea) that sort of tastes like coffee since we probably won't make it to the coffee shop today. I remember I have a mileage reimbursement check from work (only $10.97, but every penny helps), so I deposit that using my bank app. 10:15 a.m. — I finally decide to just make easy burrito bowls this week since I have a bunch of pinto beans taking up space in the pantry. I take out the beans to soak and finish up my grocery list. I'm feeling antsy, so I wipe down the bathroom, my yoga mat, and a few other surfaces around the house. 10:45 a.m. — The tow truck is here! Our driveway is very narrow and I anxiously watch it pull in while the dog goes nuts barking. It takes about 15 minutes for them to figure out how to get the car on the truck (is that normal??), but they finally do it and are off to the shop. Since it's Sunday, they don't have any mechanics in today, so the car won't even be looked at until tomorrow morning. Luckily, my boyfriend can easily work from home. 11:30 a.m. — We head out to Trader Joe's. S. grabs a frozen pizza and green tea mochi while I stock up for the week: vegetable broth, frozen strawberries, jalapeños, diced green chilies, salsa, dates, oranges, oats, spinach, avocados, GoMacro bars, eggs, and cheese, plus a big bottle of ale as consolation for S.'s car situation. $55.78 12:30 p.m. — Back home, I unload the groceries and decide to make one of our Blue Apron meals while the ingredients are still fresh. I choose the one that will take the most time: sweet potato and mushroom bao with hoisin mayo and cabbage slaw. It is more labor intensive than I tend to like when cooking, but it turns out pretty well and even S., who is not a fan of mushrooms, likes it. I don't feel like doing the dishes after all that cooking, so I just throw them in the sink to deal with later. 2:15 p.m. — S. and I are antsy and decide to venture out to the adult toy store to get a toy we'd been thinking about for awhile. We find it pretty easily, he pays for it, and we go back home to test it out. Success ;-) 4 p.m. — I realize the pinto beans have been soaking for longer than I meant them to, so I dump them in my Instant Pot with half a chopped onion, garlic, and a jalapeño. I finally deal with the dishes, fold the load of laundry I put in this morning, and wash off my makeup brushes. Then I go online and look for a new garlic press because mine is complete crap. I end up getting one through a coworker's Pampered Chef site. It's more than I thought I would spend, but she's had hers for years so I hope I'm making a good investment. $28 4:45 p.m. — While waiting for the beans to cook, I watch the most recent episode of . Those last five minutes...woof. 6 p.m. — It's dinnertime for doggo. He finishes his meal in 30 seconds flat and I head upstairs to do a 40-minute yoga video. Ahhhhh. 6:45 p.m. — The beans are done, and I whiz them with an immersion blender until they're smooth. I decide to save the burrito bowls for Tuesday's lunch, as I need to make another Blue Apron meal that I'll have the rest of tomorrow. This one (pesto and goat cheese fusilli with chard) is much less time-intensive and much more my speed. It's delicious! 7:30 p.m. — After I clean up the kitchen and take out the dog, S. and I watch a few episodes of and the first episode of , which we've been meaning to watch for awhile. 9:10 p.m. — We're both tired, and I have to get up a little earlier tomorrow to shower. A new construction project is starting on my route to work, so I also have to make sure I leave enough time for any delays that might cause. I wash my face, moisturize, and brush my teeth. S. and I chat until we both fall asleep around 10. Daily Total: $83.78",2,75
"5:30 a.m. — My alarm goes off and I hit snooze several times. 6 a.m. — I finally drag myself out of bed and downstairs to feed and take out the dog. Back inside, I jump in the shower, brush my teeth, moisturize, dry my hair, and get dressed. While I put on my makeup and straighten my hair, I listen to NPR's to catch up on headlines. 6:50 a.m. — After making the bed, I head downstairs to make a slight variation of my standard oats. This morning's version features cacao powder, which was an excellent choice. Tea brews in my travel mug while I eat. I grab an orange, leftover pasta, and a GoMacro bar and am out the door at 7:25, ten minutes later than I planned to leave. It turns out to be fine, though, because it looks like construction hasn't even started and I have time to get gas before I get to work. $20.17 8:20 a.m. — I arrive at work, put my lunch in the fridge, turn on the kids' computers and iPad, and settle in at my desk to catch up on emails and print out more coloring pages. The other children's librarian arrives and we dive into working on a grant proposal that's due next week. 12 p.m. — Lunchtime! It was a slow morning patron-wise, but it went by quickly because we were able to get a lot of work on the grant done. I go upstairs to our staff room and heat up my pasta. I spend the hour eating, reading, and catching up with S. via text. I also buy two boxes of Samoas from a coworker's daughter who's selling Girl Scout cookies. I bought Thin Mints and Tagalongs from our neighbor last week and can't believe I forgot to get Samoas! Payment isn't due until they come in March. 4:30 p.m. — Time to go home! I grab the next audiobook as well as another new book I want to read and head out to my car, which is covered in snow. Nothing a quick scrape won't fix. Traffic is a little slower than usual and I arrive home just after 5:30, in time to take S. to the shop to pick up his car. They didn't find anything wrong with it, but they did replace a recalled airbag, and he doesn't have to pay for anything. 6:05 p.m. — By the time I get home, I'm pretty hungry and it's clear that yoga is going to have to wait. I start on my final Blue Apron meal (spicy black bean enchiladas), as well as quinoa to add to my burrito bowls this week. As I'm dicing an onion, the knife slips and gives me a pretty nasty cut on my index finger. I run upstairs to grab a bandage, cursing my carelessness. 6:45 p.m. — I discover Blue Apron has forgotten to include the tortillas for the enchiladas, so I improvise and decide to make nachos instead. I don't usually drink on weeknights, but I think a glass of wine is in order. S. opens a bottle of cabernet and gives me a generous pour. I sip it as I finish cooking the food. 7:05 p.m. — Nachos and quinoa are done, and both turned out pretty well! At this point I'm too lazy to put the nachos on a plate, so I stand at the stove and eat them straight from the baking sheet. No shame. 7:45 p.m. — The kitchen is clean and it is time to veg. No yoga for me tonight, although I'll probably regret it tomorrow. S. and I watch two episodes of . 9:15 p.m. — We get ready for bed and say maybe two sentences to each other before we're both out.

"6:15 a.m. — The dog needs to go out and I have to prep my lunch, so I drag myself out of bed. No matter how early I go to sleep, it's always hard to leave my cocoon! I feed and let out the dog, brush my teeth, moisturize, get dressed, and do my makeup and hair while listening to . 7:05 a.m. — I head downstairs to make breakfast and tea (same as yesterday) and assemble a burrito bowl for lunch: beans, quinoa, shredded cheese, spinach, and avocado. S. is back at work today, so the dog needs to be crated. I bribe him with a treat and head out the door. It snowed a few inches overnight and traffic is moving slowly, but the roads aren't too bad. I notice a sign saying the construction project has been moved to next week – construction around here never starts or finishes on time! 8:32 a.m. — I arrive at work a few minutes late. I've got an hour before we open and I use this time to do last minute prep for this morning's preschool story time. (I do story time and a craft once a week.) 12:15 p.m. — I am extra hungry after my larger-than-usual story time crowd this morning. I love doing story time and it made me so happy to see my regulars as well as new faces today. My burrito bowl is delicious and I spend my lunch hour reading. 4:30 p.m. — Time to go home! I eat a GoMacro bar and listen to my audiobook on the drive. 5:30 p.m. — I change into yoga clothes and do a 30-minute yoga video. Yoga usually leaves me feeling better, but tonight, certain poses make me feel anxious and nauseated. I make it through the entire video, but need to spend about 45 minutes calming down before I'm ready to eat, so I decide to call my mom. We text every day and talk on the phone about once a week. She only lives about 45 minutes away, but with our different work schedules, I only see her two or three times a month. We catch up and I start to get hungry for dinner. 6:45 p.m. — I reheat the leftover nachos and eat way too many while watching with S. 8 p.m. — I have heartburn, ugh. I take out the dog, shower, dry my hair, brush my teeth, and get in bed. S. and I have a long chat about money, which we try to make a point of talking about regularly. I really enjoy my job but it's no secret that the pay isn't great. It's my first librarian job out of grad school and I feel like there's still so much for me to learn and do before I start looking elsewhere. We talk about areas where I can cut down my spending (ahem, groceries) and ways I can make extra money on the side. It's a tough conversation to have, but I'm glad we're able to do it. 9:30 p.m. — I read until my eyes start to droop. I loved as a kid but never got around to reading the other books, which is a shame, because Anne Shirley is one of my very favorite fictional characters! Daily Total: $0",4,75
"6 a.m. — I don't have work until 9 a.m. on Wednesdays, so I tend to sleep in. Today I hit the snooze button for 45 minutes. I had an awful dream about my dog dying and when I finally get out of bed, I'm in a funky mood. 6:45 a.m. — It's windy AF when I take out the dog, but I'm so glad my bad dream wasn't real that I really don't mind. Back inside, I start my usual routine of dressing, listening to the news, and doing my hair and makeup before heading downstairs for breakfast. 7:30 a.m. — I make the same breakfast and tea as yesterday and check my bank app. I see my federal tax refund has hit my account and I immediately transfer 90% of it to my debt. I keep the other 10% as a small cushion for my checking account until I get paid on Friday, at which point I'll transfer the rest to debt. 8 a.m. — Time to hit the road. once again keeps me company on my commute. 1:15 p.m. — I eat another burrito bowl and exchange cute animal videos with my coworkers. 5 p.m. — We close early on Wednesdays, so everyone leaves at 5. The extra half hour always seems so long! I've been feeling kind of off all day and can't wait to get home. First, I have to stop at Target to get bread and more B12 – I have been out of my supplements for a few weeks now and can definitely tell a difference in my overall energy levels. Maybe that's why I've felt weird all day. Luckily, I hate the way the Target near my house is laid out and so I'm rarely, if ever, tempted to get more than I need. $19.85 6:20 p.m. — Back home and in need of a good stretch session and maybe deep breathing exercises. I forgo a video tonight and spend 20 minutes using my Calm app and doing whatever yoga poses I think will feel good. 6:45 p.m. — The only thing that sounds good to me for dinner is toast, so that's what I make, with a little bit of ghee. S. and I sit on the couch and catch up on our days, and I look over my budget for next month. 8 p.m. — We head upstairs to get ready for bed. I'm feeling wired and tired. S. and I talk some more before he goes to sleep, and I read for a long time to calm down my brain. Today wasn't my best day mental health-wise, but I've had way worse, and tomorrow is another day. Daily Total: $19.85",5,75
"7:40 a.m. — I get to sleep in even more today because I don't work until noon on Thursdays. I check the weather and Instagram before getting out of bed. (I try not to do this most days, but clearly I don't always succeed.) I feed and take out the dog and then change into yoga clothes for a 20-minute video and 10 minutes of meditation. 8:30 a.m. — I feel so much better than yesterday and am really hungry, too! I realize I haven't seen my sister in awhile even though she lives just 15 minutes away. She's five years younger than I am, and while we fought a lot growing up, we get along really well now. I text her to see what she's up to, and she offers to come over to make me pancakes! I eat an orange to hold me over, then shower and get dressed. My sister arrives and gets started on the pancakes, and I make us tea. We catch up on each others' lives. 10:05 a.m. — The pancakes were delicious, and I'm so glad I got to see my sister. She leaves to get errands done before she heads into work this afternoon, and I go upstairs to dry my hair and finish getting ready. I decide I don't feel like listening to the news today and I jam out to Broadway tunes instead. 11 a.m. — I leave for work and fill up my tank on the way. $23.42 12 p.m. — Once I arrive, I gather everything I need for my monthly outreach visit to one of the preschools in the area. I do story time at three preschools throughout the month, and today is my big one, where I do five 30-minute sessions in a row. 12:30 p.m. — I listen to the third audiobook on my way. 3 p.m. — I am exhausted, but that was fun! I head back to the library and work on a “superb owl” display of owl books since the Super Bowl is this weekend, then take my lunch before the other children's librarian leaves for the day. 8 p.m. — Time to go home! I am so ready. 9 p.m. — I arrive at home to the news that the dog has gotten into S.'s hand cream, and I'm worried he may be sick later. He seems fine right now, so I get ready for bed and S. and I talk until we fall asleep. Daily Total: $23.42",6,75
"12:15 a.m. — I wake up to use the bathroom and hear the dog gagging under the bed. When he stops, I shine my flashlight under there but don't see anything. This song and dance continues for several hours, and neither S. nor I get any sleep until about 3:30 a.m. 7:30 a.m. — Thankfully, I don't have to work today, but I do have a doctor's appointment about 45 minutes away. The dog seems back to normal and gobbles up his breakfast. I make eggs and toast and head out the door. 9 a.m. — I'm early to the doctor, so I read in the waiting room. It's just a med check, so it's a quick appointment. I've met my deductible for the year, so no copay. 9:30 a.m. — I head over to my mom's house, which is nearby, to let out her dogs and hopefully take a little nap before meeting my dad and stepmom for lunch later. I end up starting a new book ( by Mason Buttle) and read for almost two hours. 11:15 a.m. — I drive across town to my dad and stepmom's house, and we go to a nearby diner for lunch. I get a spinach omelet, fruit, an English muffin, and chamomile tea. My dad pays. 1:15 p.m. — Back home. I throw a load of laundry in the washer and flop on the couch to watch a few episodes of . I spend a good chunk of the afternoon catching up with Sophia, Rose, Dorothy, and Blanche. 5:15 p.m. — S. and I meet a friend at the coffee shop where my sister works, and our drinks are free. 6 p.m. — We decide we're hungry, so we plan to meet back up at a tavern a few blocks away. It's freezing, so walking is not an option. Parking is awful in this part of town, but we find a spot for $5 - a steal on a Friday night. $5 7:30 p.m. — Dinner was great! I got a chicken avocado BLT and a tasty beer. We all pay separately for our meals. On the way home we stop at Whole Foods to pick up cranberry juice and pills because I feel like I have a UTI coming on. Hemp seeds are on sale, so I also grab some of those. $45.50 8 p.m. — Back home and ready to catch up on the sleep I lost last night. I read to wind down. Daily Total: $50.50",7,75
"7 a.m. — I roll out of bed and jump in the shower. I try to get ready for the day as quickly as possible, though I have the tendency to waste time when I'm still drowsy in the morning. Despite the fact that it takes me only 15 minutes to shower and then force mascara onto my eyelashes, my morning routine is often slowed down by my feeding the cat, drinking water, staring into space, etc. I glance at the clock and rush to gather my things for work. 10 a.m. — I grab a coffee ($1) and pretend to work for two hours while waiting for Firefly Festival tickets to become available. Then I quickly work my way through the site to buy two tickets for my best friend and me ($299 each) and a tent for four ($290 per person). My friends and I decided to splurge on glamping so that we can get the festival experience but still be able to shower. My friends pay me back right away on Venmo for the festival ticket and most of the tent cost, but it feels weird to spend so much money on a concert happening five months from now! $590 12 p.m. — I order lunch for the team today and put the catering on my card (triple points!), but will be reimbursed for the total. ($305 expensed) 3 p.m. — We have a call with our partner to discuss what my team has been working on over the past few weeks. I work in digital marketing, and my company partners with larger firms to handle their search and on-site strategy. I always appreciate the opportunity to give my team members credit in front of the partners. 6 p.m. — I finally leave the office and rush home to reunite with my couch. My sister invites me out with some of her friends, but I don't have the energy. I don't think I'm in the mood to spend time with Trump supporters, which I know is probably petty and immature. Daily Total: $590",1,76
"9:30 a.m. — I sleep in later than usual for a Saturday and play with my cat for a while. He's almost two but very much acts like a kitten with his clumsy pouncing. I never thought I would be a cat person but he's pretty perfect. 10:30 a.m. — I head to a workout with my sister. My mother recently got us a package of training session; we could never afford a personal trainer on our own, so I'll be sad when the training is over! We grab Starbucks after the workout to reward ourselves for being active. $3.19 12:30 p.m. — I realize I haven't deep-cleaned my apartment in a while. The bathroom could use work, and since I'm already dirty from my workout, I dive into the tub with tile cleaner in hand. 2 p.m. — After I finish cleaning, I bath in my newly sparkling bathroom. I wander into the kitchen to make coffee and decide to be ambitious and make crepes. I've always enjoyed cooking and baking but I rarely have time for either. I stuff the crepes full of chocolate chips along with almond butter and jam. 6 p.m. — All my spending yesterday coupled with my lack of motivation to be social tonight results in another weekend night on the couch. It was a stressful week at work, and I look forward to spending quality time with Netflix. Daily Total: $3.19",2,76
"9 a.m. — I wake up to a slew of emails and chat notifications from my team and realize I have to work today. Working weekends is never fun, but it happens more often than not. 11 a.m. — I drink coffee and snack on paleo tea cookies while I work. I'm definitely not going paleo, but when I bake any kind of treat I try to make sure it has some nutritional value. 2 p.m. — I take a break from working to run to the grocery store. (I only have supplies for cookies right now, and those won't exactly get me through the week.) I stock up on frozen fruit, vegetables, plantain chips, coconut yogurt, ground chicken, and miscellaneous other items. I'm thinking I'll make buffalo chicken meatballs for dinner this week. $111.48 3 p.m. — I keep working while I begin prepping my food for the week. I'm excited to start cooking again! I whip up black bean brownies (not good), chicken meatballs (good), and protein donuts for breakfast (healthy delicious). Feeling like a productive health goddess, I polish off my tea cookies in celebration. 8 p.m. — I'm essentially done working for the remainder of the evening, so I peruse Amazon for any items I might need. Although I know I have the tendency to shop online out of boredom, I stock up on a few things for my upcoming trip to South America. I purchase a few necessities along with my SPF 110 facial sunscreen. I'm a firm believer in sunscreen and I take it a bit overboard when it comes to my face and neck. $33.21 10 p.m. — I go to bed feeling relaxed and prepared for the week ahead. Then I remember that our performance reviews are this week, and I toss and turn all night. Daily Total: $144.69",3,76
"7:20 a.m. — I snooze my alarm for no less than 45 minutes and wake up feeling groggy and annoyed at myself for oversleeping. I try to rush through my morning routine, but my cat wants snuggles and I'm in a giving mood. 8:30 a.m. — The drive to work takes about 45 minutes because my office is in South Carolina and I'm not a very aggressive driver. I hurry into the office to buy a coffee ($1) and check my schedule for the day. $1 10 a.m. — I prepare for a team meeting regarding the week's priorities and think through my to do-list. It's shaping up to be a busy week, so it's important that I have a tangible task idea of how to keep my priorities in order. 11:30 a.m. — I walk out of a meeting with my manager feeling frustrated, so I try to focus my attention on the other meetings I have later this afternoon. I'm trying to be a more positive person at the office. 12:30 p.m. — A coworker and I grab lunch in the café and work on our personal reviews. The review cycle is an awkward and stressful process, and I've never been comfortable with the idea of anonymous feedback. $2.50 7 p.m. — The remainder of the day flies by, and I walk out with a few friends from work. They invite me out to dinner but since I just spent a ton of money on groceries, we decide to eat in. They join me at my place and we eat and work on our annual reviews. I struggle through my self-assessment and realize I need to keep a list of what I accomplish throughout the year. 10 p.m. — I lovingly kick everyone out of my apartment and put on before bed. It's my favorite show to fall asleep to and lulls me to sleep. Daily Total: $3.50",4,76
"7:20 a.m. — Wake up relatively late again and rush to work. I have a lot to get done today and probably should have gotten to the office earlier than usual. Once I'm in, I grab my coffee from the café and get to work. $1 10:45 a.m. — It's my coworker's birthday, so I pregame lunch with a donut. I'm not hungry yet, but after a packed morning of meetings and a slew of demanding emails, the donut really hits the spot. 12:30 p.m. — I head upstairs to grab lunch at the café before my afternoon block of meetings. I decide to treat myself to sushi and a bag of popcorn ($4.50). The sushi is fairly hit or miss – and today's is a miss. I toss half of it and run to my next meeting. $4.50 4 p.m. — Because of all my meetings today, I have trouble fitting in any time to do real work. My longer-term projects need attention, and I put off a few requests from my manager. I grab a banana with peanut butter and a seltzer and get to work. $1.50 7 p.m. — I stop for gas on my way home from work ($25.41) and swing by CVS to pick up hair dye ($10.71). I had horrible luck at a salon last month, and the root area of my hair is becoming weirdly orange. I grab an ash brown color and hope for the best. $36.12 8:30 p.m. — The dye essentially makes no difference except that I think my roots look even lighter. I don't have the energy to care enough to fix it tonight, so I trim the ends and deep condition to feel marginally better about the unnecessary damage I just caused. Daily Total: $43.12",5,76
"7:30 a.m. — SNOW DAY! Charlotte rarely gets snow and the city is not prepared with enough salt trucks or snow plows. The roads get pretty icy and three inches of snow can actually debilitate the city. With that in mind, I decide to work from home. 9 a.m. — I make a big pot of coffee and eat a leftover crepe with almond butter and jam from the weekend. I feel full but continue to eat whatever snacks I can find throughout the morning. 12 p.m. — Work was insane this morning since most people either didn't show up to the office or are leaving early. Most of the problem-solving is up to me, so this snow day is shaping up to be very busy. 6 p.m. — My training session is canceled due to the weather tonight, which is a bummer because I missed the last session too. Feeling lethargic and lazy, I head downstairs to the gym for a quick run. I'm not much of a runner, but I have pipe dreams of becoming someone who wakes up to run before work each morning. An evening on the elliptical for 30 minutes is close enough for now. 7 p.m. — I throw a load of laundry into the washer while I heat up dinner and open a bottle of wine. One of the perks of living in Charlotte is that almost all apartment complexes come with an in-unit washer and dryer. This is definitely something I could have used when I worked in New York, and I'm sure I will miss it whenever I leave Charlotte. 8:30 p.m. — I need to purchase my flights for my brother's fiancée's bachelorette party. I'm really excited to visit New Orleans for the first time. Party, here I come! $316 9:30 p.m. — Exhausted from sitting on the couch all day, I drag my lazy body to bed. The few inches of snow really make the courtyard outside my window look beautiful. Daily Total: $316",6,76
"6:45 a.m. — I wake up easily thanks to my early bedtime, and jump in the shower. I pack my protein donut and the remains of my chicken meatballs in my bag before I leave. 8 a.m. — I grab a coffee from the café and finish up some of the reports I didn't get around to yesterday. My day is pretty light on meetings and I'm excited to spend some time doing legitimate work. $1 12 p.m. — Since I packed my lunch today, I have no real need to go to the café, but I can use the walk and a seltzer. I grab two and take my time getting back to my desk. I expected a more dramatic day today after the snow day, but it's shaping up to be pretty calm. $1 3 p.m. — I present the progress my team has made this month to the broader marketing team, and everyone seems excited about what we have in the works. We have lofty goals but I feel confident that we can hit and exceed them. I walk back to my desk, proud of my team and eager to get to work. 6 p.m. — I'm dog-sitting this weekend and tonight is the first night! I'm staying at the owner's house, so I head straight there after work to let the dogs outside. I've always wanted to own a dog but they're high maintenance and expensive to board. With all the traveling I do, it just doesn't make sense for me to adopt one right now. Luckily, I have my very low-maintenance cat. Daily Total: $2",7,76
"7 a.m. — I wake up late as usual. My alarm clock known as my four-month-old baby slept in a bit. (She usually wakes around 6 to eat.) I get up and warm her bottle, feed her, and change her. After she eats I can usually count on her going back to sleep until we leave for the day, but today there is no mini nap. I quickly get dressed and we head out the door. I drop her at Grandma's house. (I pay my sister-in-law monthly to watch her three days a week – I am so lucky!) I head to work, late as usual. 9 a.m. — I sneak into the office, drop off my stuff and walk down to the coffee shop on the corner. I oversee a very small staff of people who are are great at their jobs and therefore do not need micromanagement, which I love. By the time I get into the office, our clients are in group and things are running smoothly. I order a decaf coffee (I'm breastfeeding so I limit my caffeine intake, but I love my coffee) and a breakfast croissant with ham, cheese, red onion, and tomato. So good. $9.44 1 p.m. — It's been a typical Monday – small fires and chaos and whatnot. I take a moment to text my sister-in-law asking for a picture of my babe! She loves her aunt and every picture is always a smiley one, unless she's hangry. I miss her so much but I also love the freedom of my job. It's a good balance: I get enough time to be a decisive and articulate individual and then get to go home and be a silly mommy and wife. I am getting pretty hangry myself and I don't want to spend any more money at the coffee shop today. So I eat an everything bagel from my fridge at work and snack on trail mix that I keep in my drawer. That should last me until I get home. Daily Total: $9.44",1,77
"9 a.m.— Today I get to work on time and manage to eat a breakfast of organic oatmeal and raisins. Oatmeal is great for your milk supply and since my babe is growing fast, I need to produce more breast milk. I check emails and talk to my crew before the day starts. We gossip about other coworkers, which is a horrible habit of mine. I have coupon from Express for $10 off, so I order a pair of black flats. I have a capsule work wardrobe, meaning three pairs of pants and five shirts to pair them with, but I am missing plain black flats. My kid has twice the amount of clothes as I do, but it makes my morning routine simple. I save money and I know I look professional daily. $26.27 12 p.m. — Sweet! I got a free lunch today. My coworker is a great cook but hates eating her leftovers, so she often gives them to me. Today it's homemade spaghetti, which I love. I didn't bring a lunch today so I would have had to buy otherwise. What a wonderful Tuesday. 6 p.m. — I pick up my babe and head home to make dinner. On tonight's menu is Trader Joe's Mandarin Orange Chicken and Vegetable Fried Rice with a side of squash. We eat out twice a week for dinner, usually on Friday and Saturday nights. The other nights I make really simple meals. My husband is a teacher and is studying for his master's as well as pursuing amateur boxing, so if I want to see him, dinner needs to take 20 minutes or less. We get the babe bathed, fed, and down for bed by 9 p.m. I pump for 30 minutes and then snuggle with my husband while watching wrestling on WWE. Great way to decompress. We have a 10:30 sharp bedtime. Daily Total: $26.27",2,77
"6:30 a.m. — Today I work from home, which means snuggling with my baby and watching for a few hours. I make myself oatmeal and raisins and get us dressed for the day. On days when I work from home, I take care of household admin tasks like grocery shopping and cleaning, so that I can reserve weekends for family and fun. We head to Trader Joe's and I pick up orange chicken, fried rice, protein cookies, apples, squash, grapes, cheese crunchies, pita chips, sparkling wine, tikka masala frozen dinners, frozen turkey burgers, blueberry scones, yogurt, and vanilla half and half. Basically whatever I see that looks good. I really need to get back on my meal-planning game. The babe is fussy, so no Target run until husband gets home. $57 6 p.m. — Damn Target! I went for toothpaste and of course ended up spending 200 bucks. I purchased an activity center for my babe; she has been super clingy lately and I am hoping this will entertain her just long enough for me to get some chores done. I also purchased a new shower curtain and bath mats for my grandpa's house, a birthday card and glove-and-beanie matching set for my two-year-old cousin, toothpaste, Listerine, Fixodent (for Grandpa), and this new matte lipstick I saw a commercial for. I am trying to feel like a woman/girl/person again so hopefully this will help. $200 8 p.m. — No dinner is being made tonight so my husband brings us home individual pizzas from the local make-your-own-pizza place. I get zucchini, ricotta, and pepperoni on mine. It's so freaking good. I have a glass of sparkling wine from TJ's. We all sit on the couch and watch  . My babe is tired at 9 and so am I. I put her to bed, pump for 30 minutes, and head to bed myself. $19.63 Daily Total: $276.63",3,77
"9 a.m.— Back to work! I am on time today, which I always acknowledge and celebrate. While I was pregnant, I took advantage of my freedom, working from home a lot and coming and going as I pleased. When I came back from my maternity leave, I made a goal of giving my 100% everyday, which includes being on time! Today I walk into my office and there's a crème brûlée donut waiting for me. My coworker is the best! I reimburse her for it. $3.50 12 p.m. — I brought a sandwich with cheese crunchies on the side for lunch today – pretty boring. Thursdays are pretty low-key around here, so I listen to Pandora and kill time before a 1:30 training. I look up the cost of Weight Watchers and contemplate signing up. 6 p.m. — We receive a final bill from the hospital in the mail today. $3,777! I actually do a little jig at the mailbox because it's less than I anticipated. When we found out we were pregnant we immediately started saving so we could take the max amount of maternity/paternity leave and not have to worry about bills. I was able to take four months off and my husband took six weeks. Combined, we saved $18,000 and we only used about $3,000 of it. I am really proud of us! We can pay this immediately without stress, which is such a blessing. I'll send it off tomorrow. Turkey burgers tonight for dinner. $3,777 Daily Total: $3,780.50",4,77
"11 a.m. — It's Friday, so I buy my breakfast/lunch: decaf coffee and a breakfast croissant. I decide I am not getting any work done today. I make a few phone calls and chat with my team. We eat cookies and talk about our clients. Fridays are the best. $9.44 5 p.m. — I pick up the babe and chat with my sister-in-law for a few minutes. I don't know what I want for dinner, but then my husband texts me: ""Souplantation."" Yes please, I have a coupon! 7 p.m. — The food at Souplantation is unimpressive. I'm tired and crash after feeding my babe for the night. My husband puts her to sleep while I doze off on the couch. I didn't even pump, which is going to suck in about three hours. $22.59 Daily Total: $32.03",5,77
"11 a.m. — On Saturdays we all go to my Grandpa's house to get his groceries and do his errands. He doesn't drive anymore, thank goodness. I stop at the donut shop by his house and get him a dozen plain ones. $8 2 p.m. — We pick up his groceries and then grab burgers at In-N-Out. Grandpa pays for lunch. I consider it payment for services rendered. 6 p.m. — I'm still content from lunch so my husband grabs a sandwich for himself. I snack on pita chips and have half a glass of sparkling wine. We cuddle on the couch and watch Dave Chappelle's new comedy special on Netflix. My husband and I talk about going to see next week and possibly going to this 80s-themed bar we've been wanting to go to for while. We conclude that there is no way we can do both given our 10:30 bedtime, so we decide to go to the bar next week and the movies the week after. Grandma 1 and Grandma 2 can babysit. 12 a.m. We feel wild for staying up this late and exhausted. After Chappelle, we watch a show about women who go on a New Kids On The Block cruise. It's freaking fantastic. What bedtime? But seriously, I'll be up in two hours for my babe's 3:30 a.m. feed, so I need to go to bed. Daily Total: $8",6,77
"9 a.m. — Yay Sunday. We wake up and I eat a bowl of oatmeal and raisins. We head to church and I buy a decaf coffee. We go to my mother-in-law's house for free laundry and Sunday dinner. $2 6 p.m. — My mother-in-law doesn't feel like cooking tonight, so she takes us out for Mexican food. I destroy my dinner – breastfeeding makes me monstrously hungry all the time. My mother-in-law gives me her leftovers and some things from her fridge that she won't eat. We take homemade marinara sauce (which I freeze), tomatoes, and frozen chicken breasts. Yay! 7 p.m. — We get home and settle in. I put away the laundry and freeze the sauce. I pack the baby's diaper bag in preparation for the week to start again. Sundays always make me sad. This week we have an audit at work so I am going to have to step it up and actually do my job. My husband is holding my babe and playing video games. I sit down with my half glass of sparkling cider and read in preparation for my book club meeting. I never finish the book but I love chatting and eating! Bedtime at 10:30. Daily Total: $2",7,77
"6:50 a.m. — Time to get up. I've been planning to start exercising at home in the mornings, but my boyfriend stayed over last night, so I don't this morning. I rush to get ready for work, as I like to get in early on Mondays. Breakfast is just a glass of almond milk. 8:20 a.m. — I need coffee! My coffee connoisseur colleagues loathe the office coffee, but I don't mind it. I like good coffee, but I don't like to shell out $2-$4 a pop for it, so I recently invested in a single serve French press and signed up for a coffee subscription service that sends me a new blend every few weeks at $14.40 per bag. I make myself a cup. 12:30 p.m. — Lunchtime! It has been quite a stressful morning. I usually eat the same meal for lunch every day and I really don't mind it: a vegetarian wrap from a place near my office, which I eat at my desk. I rarely eat out with my colleagues, except for birthdays or project celebrations. Lunchtime is my ""me"" time. $5.70 1 p.m. — My BF's birthday is in a week and he already told me what he wants: the latest volume of a manga he's been reading. It was only just released today and no local bookstore is carrying it yet, so I place an order online. Cross my fingers it will arrive before his birthday! $20 9:30 p.m. — Wow, it's been a long and stressful day at work. I have a big deadline at the end of this month, so I will probably work late most nights and won't have much of a social life until then! Most food places are already closed by now, so I go to a supermarket nearby to grab discounted sushi packs from the deli counter for dinner. There's a discount on my favorite Kettle Chips, so I grab those too. My BF is staying over again tonight, so we eat together at my place. Then we hang out with my housemates until it's time to get ready for bed. $11 Daily Total: $36.70",1,78
"7:20 a.m. — No morning exercise either today. I think I need to postpone my morning exercise plan until after the work deadline. Breakfast today is chocolate pistachio milk, which is super yum, and a caramel bun that I share with my BF. 8:30 a.m. — At work, I treat myself to my usual coffee from my French press. 12:30 p.m. — Same vegetarian wrap as yesterday for lunch. I like not having to think about what to eat since it's the same almost every day. (At this point you might have realized that I'm kind of boring.) $5.70 8 p.m. — Still at work, but am getting hungry for dinner. I'm too lazy to walk to any food places out of the office, so I opt for a salad from the salad vending machine (yes, there is such a thing!) at work. I quite like the salads – they are very customizable and replaced daily. I'm getting one with quinoa, spinach, corn, tomatoes, raisins, cheddar cheese, pine nuts, and chicken breast, plus lemon-pepper dressing to go with it. $4.90 9 p.m. — I steal a pack of Oreos from our team's snack table. Not really hungry, just stress-eating! 10:50 p.m. — I am so fatigued that I don't think I can carry on working. I might be the last person in the office. I finally call a cab and head home. I have some Kettle chips, shower, and get ready for bed. ($6 expensed) Daily Total: $10.60",2,78
"7:30 a.m. — I sleep in longer than usual because I'm exhausted from working overtime yesterday. I check my Fitbit and apparently only got around five hours of sleep last night, so I anticipate that today will be rough. 8 a.m. — For breakfast I have a glass of chocolate pistachio milk again. 8:45 a.m. — There was a train disruption, so I arrive at work later that expected. Can't be bothered to make my own brew today, so I have a cup of office coffee. I check my emails and remember that I have to get a senior colleague to sign my application form for the Young Engineer of the Year award that our Marketing department persuaded me to apply to. I feel like I don't fit the bill, but hey, I'll try my luck! I'll find out next month if I get shortlisted. 12:45 p.m. — I am meeting a university friend for lunch who I haven't seen in a while. I suggest a poke place near my work, and we each have spicy salmon poke with broccoli. She insists on paying when the bill comes, so I treat her to coffee at a nearby joint afterwards. I get myself a decaf latte (I need sleep tonight), and she orders a skinny flat white. It's always fun to catch up with old friends and find out what they are up to now! $8.50 1:45 p.m. — A colleague offers me a Swiss roll slice. I can never resist cake, so I gladly take it even though I'm still full from lunch. 4 p.m. — Grab a cab to an offsite meeting with a client. I think it'll be a long one. ($8.70 expensed) 9:30 p.m. — See, what did I tell you? The project director from the client side wanted us to run through all the draft tender queries with him, hence why we finished late. It is raining outside and my laptop has run out of battery, so I go home instead of back to the office. A project manager from the client side offers some of us a ride. I thank him and ask to be dropped at a mall near my place so that I can get dinner. 9:45 p.m. — Only fast food chains are open at this hour. I was considering getting KFC for dinner, but I see that they don't sell the Spicy Sichuan Special anymore! I go to 7-Eleven instead and get a microwave-ready kimchi fried rice. I guess this will do. $3.40 10 p.m. — Walk home to my place and my pants and shoes get soaked in the rain. I eat my food while reading mindless articles on Buzzfeed and then continue to work for a bit. 11:20 p.m. — I shower and aim to get to bed by midnight for some much-needed sleep. Daily Total: $11.90",3,78
"7:30 a.m. — Wake up relatively late again. I get ready, have my usual chocolate pistachio milk for breakfast, and dash to work. 8:30 a.m. — Another coffee from work. I've only just noticed how strong the office coffee is, as I instantly feel like an Energizer Bunny after I finish my cup. Ready to crack my brain for another challenging day. 12:30 p.m. — Lunch is another vegetarian wrap that I eat quietly at my desk. I received a reimbursement check of $300 from my insurance company yesterday, so I use my lunchtime to deposit it at my bank's check deposit box. $5.70 9 p.m. — After a long day of work, I am considering either staying even later at the office or instead going to get an additional birthday present for my BF. Most shops in Singapore close at 10, so if I leave now, I'll be able to make it. My BF and I normally extra-spoil each other on birthdays, so I have quite a generous annual gift budget. He wants a bean bag chair from Muji, so I head over there. My BF texts to ask if I have already left work and if he can stay over. I tell him ""no"" so that I can keep the gift hidden from him! 9:30 p.m. — The bean bag is out of stock! And I'm told that it won't be back in stores for a while. I'm afraid I won't have any presents for my BF to open on his actual birthday because the manga won't be there in time. Panicked, I head to the nearby Crate and Barrel to see if they sell any bean bags, but they don't. I give up and head home. I should have done my gift shopping earlier! 10 p.m. — I text my BF that he can still come over if he wants to. I go to 7-Eleven again and pick up a microwave-ready black pepper chicken leg and a pack of ready-to-eat onsen eggs. $4.70 10:30 p.m. — BF arrives at my place. I feel too guilty about the birthday present thing and tell him that I won't have presents for him in time for his actual birthday. He assures me that it's okay and that all he wants for his birthday is to cook a pie with me (we already discussed making Hairy Bakers' beef pie recipe). I feel so grateful, but still very guilty. Daily Total: $10.40",4,78
"6:50 a.m. — Wake up early today to finish some work. BF is still sleeping so I try not to wake him. 8 a.m. — Office coffee again because I've given up. 12:30 p.m. — Another vegetarian wrap for lunch. Apparently I have enough stamps on my loyalty card (not that hard if you get the same thing from the same place almost every day), so I only have to pay $0.50 for my lunch today. Small win! $0.50 8 p.m. — Leave work today after sending important emails. I was planning to stay later to finish more work, but my BF texted to say that he might have to work tomorrow (since he has to travel to Hong Kong next week for a conference) and I want to see him. I decide that I will continue my work tomorrow instead. Today is the earliest that I am leaving work in a while, which I take as a win! 8:30 p.m. — I thought I'd try to look for the bean bag at another Muji store a few MRT stops away just to try my luck, but of course they don't have any in stock there either, so I reluctantly put my name on a waitlist. I tell them that I might change my mind if the item arrives too late and ask if they can hold payment until collection date. They agree! 8:45 p.m. — In preparation for this weekend's beef pie, I go to an upscale supermarket in the mall to survey the meat selection. Then I text some friends and my housemates to invite them to my BF's birthday celebration. 9 p.m. — On my way home, I pick up a spicy barramundi miso jjigae soup with bread from a nearby spot. I have enough reward points on my member card to redeem a free soup, so dinner is free! I live for days like this – an almost free lunch and a free dinner! 1 a.m. — I stay up late doing dances in my room to hit my daily steps goal. My insurance has a program where if you hit a certain amount of steps within a week, you can get a voucher for $7.60 that you can use at a supermarket chain or Starbucks or as credit on Uber. I'm still not close to my weekly target so far, so I try to get in as many steps as I can tonight. I'm not going to lose that sweet $7.60! Daily Total: $0.50",5,78
"8:30 a.m. — Get up. 10 a.m. — Arive at the office. I serve myself a cup of coffee before starting work. I need to get as much done as possible today. 1:30 p.m. — Get a spicy poke bowl with broccoli again for lunch. $8.30 3:30 p.m. — I think I'm done for today! I go to the mall near my place to get what I need for the birthday celebration tomorrow. 4 p.m. — I have $3.80 insurance voucher that will be expiring soon, so I drop by a supermarket in the mall and get a refillable pack of hand wash plus my favorite high-end sweet potato chips in the discount aisle (they're expiring in two weeks, but that won't be a problem!). Total comes out to be $4.40 but my voucher covers most of it. $0.60 4:30 p.m. — I order a chocolate cake from a local artisanal chocolate specialist in the same mall that I will pick up and pay for tomorrow. 5 p.m. — I plan to get giant number balloons for tomorrow, but the shop assistant advises me to get them a few hours before the event to make sure they're at maximum perkiness. They're $18.20 each, so the total will be $36.40 for two. Since I know I'll be busy cooking tomorrow, I text my friend to ask for help and she kindly agrees to pick them up for me (and pay for them) tomorrow. I buy some nice-looking candles before heading home. $5.70 5:30 p.m. — Feeling pretty lazy while I wait for my BF to be done with his work so that we can go on a dinner date. 6:30 p.m. — BF texts to say that he might need to stay late at work, so I cancel our dinner reservation and we decide that he will get us takeout later instead. I have grapes as a snack to ward off hunger until then. 8:45 p.m. — BF finally texts that he will be leaving work soon! My housemate joins us and we order chicken rice. Dinner is BF's treat for me, so my housemate settles the dinner monies with him. 9:30 p.m. — We finally get to eat, thank goodness! BF informs me that he might need to work tomorrow so we might not have enough time to make pie *sad face*. I suggest ordering food for the party instead. We spend the night watching the first episode of with my housemate before going to bed. Daily Total: $14.60",6,78
"9:30 a.m. — Have a cup of coffee for breakfast. 1 p.m. — Go to the nearby mall to get my winter coat dry cleaned. (I have postponed cleaning it since my Christmas trip to visit my BF's family in London last December!) $15.20 2 p.m. — I get wardrobe freshener, facial cotton, body lotion, and laundry detergent at the supermarket. I use two of my insurance vouchers, so I get $7.60 off. $8.10 3 p.m. — Pick up the birthday cake that I ordered yesterday. They got the first letter of my BF's name wrong! But luckily the skillful pastry chef easily fixes it. $26 3:15 p.m. — Vegan chili soup with a bread roll for lunch today. $5.70 4 p.m. — I have to get in 12,500 steps today to meet my weekly goal! I'm feeling too lazy to walk outside so I search for dance cardio workout videos on YouTube and dance my heart out until I reach 12,500! My friend texts to say that she found a party supply shop that sells cheaper balloons than the ones I found, and she kindly picks some up. 5:30 p.m. — Two of my other housemates are back home, and my BF texts that he's leaving work soon. I order pizza for dinner for the seven of us – my treat. There's a discount deal at the pizza place for four 11-inch pizzas and two starters. I place the order on Deliveroo for the food to be delivered at 6:30. $63.50 6:30 p.m. — BF is here, yay! My friend texts that she'll be late but we start eating. 8 p.m. — We watch a movie that literally starts with a birthday celebration scene where everyone sings Happy Birthday song (a complete coincidence), so we take this opportunity to whip out the surprise birthday cake! One of my housemates sneakily requests to pause the movie by excusing himself to get drinks in the kitchen. I quickly excuse myself to the kitchen as well to prepare the cake and candles. Another housemate turns all the lights off and I emerge from the kitchen with the cake! Everyone sings and my BF smiles from ear to ear. We take photos, BF blows out the candle, and I serve the cake. We resume the movie and spend the rest of the night drinking gin and tonics. I pay my friend back for the balloons. $27.30 12 a.m. — BF stays over and I sing him ""Happy Birthday"" right at midnight before we snuggle and fall asleep. Daily Total: $145.80",7,78
"7 a.m. — Wake up in a panic! I should be leaving for work in about five minutes and yet I just woke up. I run around doing an abbreviated version of my normal morning routine, which includes brushing my teeth, quickly pulling my hair up into a semi-nice bun, applying mascara and brow pencil, and throwing on a comfy shift dress because I know I'm in for a long day. 7:30 a.m. — I walk the dogs, grab the breakfast and lunch that I packed last night, and take out ground sausage from the freezer to defrost for dinner. While doing so, my roommate and best friend, L.*, talks me down from my panic. I have flexible hours, so it doesn't really matter if I'm late, as long as I work eight hours a day. I just hate being late. I run out the door to catch the 7:47 a.m. train. 8:30 a.m. — After a nerve-racking bus ride (I had to stand and I hate standing on the bus because I'm clumsy), I arrive at my desk 30 minutes later than usual. Not bad for waking up 45 minutes late. I settle in with my breakfast of yogurt and granola while I finish a project from yesterday. 10:45 a.m. — I'm not going to make it until lunch, so I grab two Cuties tangerines from my bag and take a Twitter break in between projects. 12 p.m. — Heat up my taco rice bowl, which consists of chicken, salsa, taco seasoning, black beans, corn, cheese, and rice. I make this for lunch quite a bit because it's quick and heats up nicely. It all cooks in one pan in about 30 minutes and I eat it with tortilla chips. Sometimes I add avocado in the morning if we have any, which is rare. Today I sit at my desk and work through lunch so I can still leave at a decent hour. 2 p.m. — Struggling to keep my eyes open. I'm normally a morning person (this morning was weird for me since I normally wake before my alarm), so I start to struggle with my energy levels in the afternoon. I head to the kitchen with a tea bag from my desk and brew myself a cup of black chai, which I drink while snacking on chocolate-covered peanut butter pretzels from Trader Joe's. 4:29 p.m. — As I'm hovering over the punch-out button, a manager comes to my desk to show me how to do a new project that needs to be finished tomorrow. I dutifully follow her to her office. I know I'll be grateful for the work tomorrow, but now I'm a little annoyed to be missing my bus. 5:30 p.m. — Finally home, so I walk and feed the dogs. L. washes the dishes from last night so I take out the trash and get the mail while talking to my grandma, mom, and sister on the phone. Then I start cooking dinner: baked ziti, one of my favorite meals, which L. loves too. 6:15 p.m. — While dinner is in the oven, I have a beer and go through the mail. There's an invitation to my sorority anniversary gala next month. I knew this was coming and have been setting aside money for a couple months to help cover the costs. I fill out the RSVP right away and write a check to hold my spot. $60 6:45 p.m. — L. and I read during dinner like the true grandmas we are, which then leads to us both reading in her bed, commenting out loud about funny things we come across in our books. I finish by Camille Perri, which I really enjoyed even though it hit a little close to home (since I'm an assistant). 9:30 p.m. — Take very cranky dogs for a walk in the rain. I shower, staring longingly at my shampoo. I'm trying to stretch out the days in between washes because my hair is getting too greasy, too fast. After getting in my PJs and into bed, I text with D.*, a guy I've been seeing recently, for a couple minutes before falling asleep around 11:15. Daily Total: $60",1,79
"6 a.m. — I wake up 15 minutes before my alarm, but lay very still because I know I don't have the energy to match my puppy's excitement for the morning yet. Somehow, he knows I'm awake and comes to investigate by sticking his nose in my mouth. I play with him for 15 minutes while my older dog shoots us dirty looks from bed for waking her up. 6:15 a.m. — Both dogs are sleeping again, so I get ready. Once again, I pull my hair up into a semi-nice bun because it's too greasy to do anything else with. I wash my face, swipe on witch hazel toner, and apply mascara, brow pencil, and brow gel. I take the dogs for a quick walk, brew tea in a to-go mug, set two chicken breasts out to defrost for dinner, and say a quick good morning to L. (who is not a morning person and I think hates me for about the first 30 minutes of the day) before I run out to catch the train at 7:23. 8 a.m. — Get to work and start on the project I was given yesterday. I eat yogurt with granola and two Cuties, because I'm a creature of habit when it comes to food for the week. 10:30 a.m. — Get a text from my mom that she needs the money for my phone bill by Friday. I decide to just send it to her now since I have the money and tomorrow is Pay Day. 12:30 p.m. — I take my lunch hour late today because I want to finish up what I'm working on before I eat. I have another taco rice bowl with chips and chocolate-covered peanut butter pretzels. When I get back to my desk, I order some things from Amazon: a pack of six picture frames for some travel posters I got while I was living in Australia, a pack of three iPhone chargers, and a small hammer. All of these things have been sitting in my cart for a while and I have extra money from budgeting my last paycheck so I decide to get them now. $47.59 1:30 p.m. — I tackle a confusing billing problem and then the afternoon breezes by. Take a small break for my afternoon tea, of course. 4:20 p.m. — Sign out 10 minutes early, which means I can catch the earlier bus and train, getting me home in about half the time. I love when I can do that. 5 p.m. — I take a long walk with the dogs while talking to my grandma on the phone about her book club meeting today. I recommended the book they read for today, so she tells me about how the other grandmas in the club gushed about me. Makes me feel like an A+ granddaughter! L. normally does the dishes when she gets home in the evening since I cook for us, but she has to work late, so I do all the dishes, wipe down the counters, and get dinner started. 6 p.m. — D. calls me on his way home from work and I have a beer while talking to him and cooking dinner. He got off much earlier than he thought and wants to take me to dinner, but since I already started cooking and have plans with L. later, I turn him down. I promise to call him before I go to bed, though. 7:30 p.m. — After dinner, L. and I take the train to the library, but once we get off we realize it's about to close. We go to Target instead, since it's conveniently at the same stop. I buy shampoo, conditioner, body wash, and nails to hang my new picture frames. I use my REDcard to get 5% off. $15.56 9 p.m. — When I get home, I shower and actually wash my hair this time. I feel like a whole new woman. Then I put on a clay face mask, and while it dries I quickly tidy my room and bathroom. How does everything get so messy so fast? 10:30 p.m. — I walk the dogs and then get in bed to call D. He tells me he wants us to get more serious and wants to know if I will delete my Tinder (which is where we met). This sounds like a great idea to me. I tell him I deleted my Tinder shortly after our first date, which makes him really happy because he did the same thing. I fall asleep shortly after, feeling pretty content with my life.

"2:30 a.m. — My puppy has been waking me about every 30 minutes. I have no idea what his problem is, but he is clearly very upset about something and won't let me sleep. He finally settles at about 5:30 a.m. 6:15 a.m. — I decide that I need extra sleep so I set my alarm for 30 minutes from when it first goes off. It is still a struggle to get up when it rings again at 6:45. My pup doesn't seem to notice my lack of sleep and runs around my feet while I sleepily go through my morning routine. 7:15 a.m. — Take both dogs for a walk, set out chicken to defrost, grab my lunch, and head to the train. When I walk outside, the train is already at the station, five whole minutes early. I watch it leave as I wait to cross the busy street. The next train is of course running late so it takes me nearly double the normal time to get to work. On the bus, I send my friend my portion of the money for Spotify for the year. 8:30 a.m. — Eat breakfast (yogurt and Cuties) at my desk again while reading through emails. 9:30 a.m. — My boss is back in the office today. I'm the assistant to the VP, but he has never had an assistant before (and I've never been an assistant before) so we are still trying to figure out a good balance. Others in the department don't like to bring me extra work when he is in, meaning I have much less to do today. But I brought this up to him last month, so he's been trying to convince people to assign me things. 10:30 a.m. — Since I have some free time, I call a doctor's office I'm hoping will become my new primary care doctor. I set up a wellness checkup for later in the month, which will save me about 25% on my health insurance through work. 11 a.m. — Finally someone brings me a fascinating market trends project that I thoroughly enjoy chipping away at. Who knew I would like market trends. I sure didn't. 12:30 p.m. — Lunch is same as yesterday, but with Cheez-Its instead of pretzels. I eat at my desk again to make up for my lateness this morning. I miss sunlight. While I'm eating, L. texts me about a comedian coming to our area in March and wants to know if I want to go. I do, and offer to buy our tickets right now, only to realize that I don't have my wallet with me. I panic for a second before realizing it must be in my backpack from our Target trip yesterday. I'll have to buy the tickets later. 3 p.m. — Still have nothing to do. I make tea and settle in for some money management, since I got paid today. I have a system that sounds much more complex on paper then it does in real life. I have three accounts: my basic debit account, a debt account without a debit card attached, and a savings account. My direct deposit comes into my main debit account twice a month and when it does, I move all the money I've calculated that I need for bills into my second account. Then I move either $75 or $45 into my savings account (so I save a total of $120 a month). I pay all of my bills with my second debit account but I pay my daily expenses with the first account, so I know how much “fun” money I have to spend (""fun"" meaning groceries, mainly). I like to keep them separate in my head. Today I move $495 into my second account and $75 into my savings account, since I already paid rent this month. 4:30 p.m. — As I'm leaving work, L. texts me with some family news and tells me she'll be flying home tomorrow night. When I get home, she has walked and fed my dogs and is rightfully extra sad, so I get to work making one of her favorite comfort foods, chicken noodle soup — with the chicken I set out earlier while she gives me the full story. 9:30 p.m. — I head to bed early after walking the dogs one last time. Daily Total: $0",3,79
"5:45 a.m. — I wake up early but have no desire to move from my warm bed, so I read a bit while my pups shockingly stay asleep. I started by Jennie Melamed yesterday on the bus and it's amazingly scary in a ""this could totally happen"" kind of way. Around 6:15, I start getting ready, doing what I do most other mornings, but I also help L. pack a bit and say goodbye since I won't her see for a few days. 7:45 a.m. — Friday Starbucks stop. I get a grande soy black and white hot chocolate ($4.72) with a gift card I have that's already loaded in my Starbucks app. 10:45 p.m. — My boss messages me from a meeting that he wants lunch for 25 people at noon, and he requests something healthier than pizza. After frantically searching for a place that can deliver for that many people that fast, I order 25 catering lunch boxes from CPK and one for myself as well. I give the taco bowl that I brought for lunch to my coworker who is always commenting on how good my lunches look, and she gives it a stamp of approval. ($427.86 expensed) 12:05 p.m. — I set up the lunches when they arrive and then take mine down to my desk. 3:30 p.m. — Get an email from my credit card company that my credit limit won't be raised, which is weird, because I didn't request a higher limit. 4 p.m. — I head home early because I worked through lunch and catch an early bus that gets me home in half the time again! I walk and feed the dogs their dinner before cleaning up the apartment a little bit. My friend from college, C.*, is coming up from Tucson for the night. I haven't seen her in a few months because she's in grad school out of state, so I'm excited to spend time with her. 6:30 p.m. — C. finally arrives! We have leftover chicken noodle soup and beer while we discuss our plans for the evening. We decide we want to get dressed up and go out to a nearby bar with a fun crowd and live music. 8:45 p.m. — The band is amazing. We each have two cocktails and a beer along with an order of fries. I cover the whole bill because I know grad school is expensive and I can cover the cost. We chill there for a few hours before my grandma self starts to get tired, and we head home around midnight. I walk the dogs one more time and head to bed. $70.52 Daily Total: $70.52",4,79
"8 a.m. — Both dogs shockingly let me sleep in a bit. I get up and check on C., who is just waking up too. I take the dogs for a walk, and then C. and I take the train downtown to a breakfast place on L.'s recommendation. We both order breakfast sandwiches and strawberry lemonades. C. offers to cover breakfast since I got our drinks last night, but it's not very expensive, so I pay again. I'm sure she'll get me back in the future. $30.48 10:30 a.m. — On our way home, we walk through the farmer's market but I don't see anything I want, mostly because I'm too full to really think about food. On the train back home, we make plans with another friend to meet at the mall for shopping and lunch. 11:30 a.m. — C. and I amuse ourselves by trying on the ugliest things Forever 21 has to offer while we wait for our friend. Then I actually find and buy a shirt I like, which is rare for me at Forever 21 ($11.90). We stop by Sephora, where I buy two clay face masks ($17.47), before we head to the food court for lunch. I get Chipotle ($8.65) while the others get Panda Express. After lunch, I buy new underwear from American Eagle ($31.67) and chocolate from See's Candy with a gift card ($12.50). We say goodbye to our friend, and then C. and I head to the movies. The only seats left are right in front of the screen, though, so we decide to go to the theater closer to my apartment. $69.69 3:30 p.m. — On the drive back, I get hit with a massive headache, so as soon as we get home I abandon C. to sit in my dark room for a while. I end up falling asleep but wake up just before we need to leave for the movie, feeling much better. I walk the dogs and quickly feed them dinner  before we hope on the train. 6:30 p.m. — C. buys my ticket, drink, and candy since I covered our drinks and breakfast. We see , which is much funnier than I thought it would be. 9 p.m. — On the way home, I run into Target to buy a hammer because the one I ordered from Amazon still isn't here and I want to get things hung up this weekend. I'll just return the Amazon one when it finally gets here. While at Target, L. calls me and updates me on her trip home. She sounds sad and I just want to give her a hug. But she'll be home a day earlier then I thought, which is nice for me. $6.40 10 p.m. — C. spends the night again because it's too late to drive home, so we put on (our favorite movie) and talk more about our lives. 12 a.m. — Just as I'm getting into bed after walking the dogs, D. calls me and we talk for about 30 minutes before I start falling asleep on the phone. Daily Total: $106.57",5,79
"8:30 p.m. — I get up and walk the dogs. When I get home, C. is up and hungry. I make eggs, toast and add a Cutie to each plate because they're about to go bad. She leaves shortly after breakfast, and I get back in bed for a couple hours to go on my computer and read for a bit. 12 p.m. — Finally get out of bed and hang up all of my wall décor. I moved into this apartment almost six months ago but I have barely unpacked anything. I sold most of my furniture a few years ago just before I moved to Australia, where I lived for over a year. When I came back, I was extremely broke and was lucky that L. let me move in with her without having to put down a deposit. I was working as an office temp and my paychecks barely covered rent and bills, so I couldn't buy any new furniture for my room. I have a stable, well-paying job now, but I am moving to Belgium in about six months and I don't see the point of buying furniture at this point. The bare walls are starting to kill me, though, so I want to put up travel posters and family photos. 4:30 p.m. — Take the train to Target. I buy Q-tips, ice cream, soda, and mozzarella sticks. When I get home, I walk and feed the dogs. $14.97 6 p.m. — For dinner, I have mozzarella sticks and a vodka Sprite (the vodka was a Christmas present from my boss), and then ice cream for dessert. Not the healthiest meal I've had this week, but as an adult you sometimes need to do stupid things like this, I think, just to prove you can. 10 p.m. — I walk the dogs one last time, then call D. for the night. His work schedule has been crazy this last week and I'm starting to miss him. Daily Total: $14.97",6,79
"6 a.m. — I'm wide awake, but it's Martin Luther King Jr. Day, so I have the day off. I lay in bed for a while trying to fall back to sleep but eventually give up and take the dogs for a walk. 10 a.m. — FaceTime with my best friend, who just got engaged! While on the phone with her, I look online for an engagement present. I find a few things I like but nothing I love, so I don't buy anything yet. 2 p.m. — There is a reason I don't live by myself – I'm going crazy from loneliness. I need L. to come back. In order to combat the crazy, I make a menu for the week and a shopping list before I jump on the train and head to the grocery store. I buy veggies, chicken breast, rice, applesauce, and a few other items I need to make all my dinners. L. and I normally shop together and split on the spot, but I didn't want to wait for her to get back so I went myself and plan to just Venmo her for it later. $40.78 4:30 p.m. — I start cooking my lunch for the week. I'm making a chicken stir-fry with rice on the side. I got a rice cooker for Christmas and it has really improved my rice game. I walk and feed the dogs while I wait for all the food to cool down so I can pack it up. 7:45 p.m. — L. has landed! I cook frozen raviolis for us for dinner while she takes the train home. When she finally gets here, my dogs go nuts and I'm very excited as well. We spend the rest of the night talking about her trip and my weekend before I walk the dogs, shower, and finally go to sleep around 11. Daily Total: $40.78",7,79
"4:45 a.m. — It's a flight day, so I'm up and out of bed far earlier than I would prefer. I showered the night before and quickly put my clothes on today. I live about an hour and 20 minutes from the airport and my goal is to leave the house by 5:15 a.m. I grab my things and hit the road. Twenty minutes into my drive, I see Dunkin' Donuts. My routine on flight days is to always get a large coffee with almond milk and a turkey sausage and egg wrap. I typically skip breakfast, but travel days are long and this may be the only thing I get the chance to eat for a while. $5.25 8:30 a.m. — We finally receive confirmation from the aviation crew that the plane is departing. It was a tougher-than-expected crowd this morning and we had some hiccups with luggage. My boss and I manage a private travel program that flies clients from destinations around North America, and we deal with a very wealthy clientele. Every day is different. We don't have time to dwell, however, because we have another flight leaving from a different airport in two hours. Before getting in my car, I buy a huge bottle of water from the vending machine. I left my bottle at home. $2.30 2 p.m. — The second flight is delayed due to weather, and everyone is in a particularly sour mood. Once the plane is off the ground, my boss and I pack up our things and decide that a post-work cocktail is needed. We drive around for a while until we find the perfect dive bar that reminds us both of college. We each order a beer and proceed to chat for the next half hour. Upon finishing the first drink, we announce that second one is in order and we spend another 45 minutes talking about work, life, and everything else. We make friends with the bartender, who must have given us a deal. The bill is $12, and we split it equally with both of us leaving a $3 tip. $9 5 p.m. — After dropping my boss off at the train station, I start my long drive home. I stop at a gas station along the way and fill up my car. When I drive to the airport, I can expense the trip, and I get $0.55 per mile. This adds up, especially when we have multiple flight days each month, and I typically put my expense checks into savings. I bought a car new six months ago, and I've already put 10,000 miles on it. ($33.42 expensed) 6:45 p.m. — I get home and immediately let my dog out. On busy work days, I ask one of my seasonal hires (who is 20 and in college) to let my dog out throughout the day. He typically comes to work and everywhere else with me, but we've been crazy busy lately, and it's just not feasible for me to bring him along. I always leave $20 when I ask her to do this, which helps when I ask her for last-minute favors. $20 Daily Total: $36.55",1,80
"8 a.m. — I wake up to my alarm and lounge in bed for about 45 minutes until I decide it's time to get up. I let my dog out and proceed to hop in the shower. My job offers me a ton of flexibility, and when we are not busy, I can choose my hours. Since I'm a night owl, I prefer to go into work around 10 a.m., but I have no issue working until 8 or 9 at night. I finish getting ready, grab my dog, and get in my car to go to the office. Along the way, I stop at the local coffee shop and order a drip coffee with almond milk. $2.60 12:30 p.m. — I'm an awful cook, and since I travel so much, I typically don't buy a ton of groceries. I've tried meal planning, but my schedule is all over the place and I eat out more often than not. Around 12, I call in an order to a local café. I get a chicken Caesar salad to go, and get in my car to pick it up. While waiting in line, I buy a kombucha as well. It's all ridiculously overpriced. but I'd rather eat something I enjoy versus trying to make something that doesn't taste great. $15.60 6 p.m. — It's time to leave work and I remember that I need to get dog food. I stop by the local ranch supply store to buy a overpriced bag of grain-free lamb and rice dog food. I'm single and tend to spoil my dog more than is needed. While standing in line, I also get him a bag of dog treats for the fun of it. $44.99 7:30 p.m. — I'm not quite hungry for dinner, but I know I will get cravings at 10 p.m. if I don't eat something now. I eat minestrone soup from a can because again, I can't cook. Chow down on that while finishing up some work, and I'm ready for bed and watching Netflix by 9:30. Daily Total: $63.19",2,80
"4:45 a.m. — It's another flight day and I really did not want to get out of bed. We're only working out of one private airport today, so I bring my dog because he's allowed in our office. We leave the house later than normal at 5:30 a.m., and I can tell that I didn't eat enough yesterday because I can feel a headache coming on. By the time I hit the Dunkin' Donuts, I'm already thinking about food that I normally would never eat. I order my typical coffee with almond milk plus the turkey sausage wrap, but I order a side of hashbrowns as well. I immediately regret it because the potatoes are disgusting and weren't worth the extra $1.50. $7.40 11 a.m. — The plane takes off without any issues, which is a great relief. I'm still tired from the morning drive and have had three cups of free coffee from the airport café. The breakfast I ate earlier did nothing for my headache, so my boss and I order something from Seamless. We choose a local deli, and we both get a cobb salad with extra avocado. It takes nearly two hours for the order to arrive, and once we get it, we are both disappointed. I've never been a big fan of delivery services outside of NYC, and this experience reminds me why. $27 1 p.m. — After our sad lunch, my boss and I leave for the day. We both think a Bloody Mary would be good before we go on our separate ways, and we find a local tavern close to the train station. We sip on those for about 30 minutes while chatting about our personal lives and our plans for after the holidays. My boss offers to buy this round, and I say that I'm long overdue to get the next one. Once we finish, I drop her off at the train station and make my way home. 5 p.m. — Before I get home, I stop at the local market in my little town for a few essentials. I love shopping locally but the prices are definitely stiffer than normal grocery stores. I get two avocados, a bag of quinoa, cherry tomatoes, brie, crackers, mini corn tortillas, turkey burger, black bean hummus, and a bottle of my favorite sauvignon blanc. The price seems ridiculous for the amount of items I purchased, and I remind myself to eat all of this before ordering out. Back at home, I open the wine and proceed to cook the turkey burger and make tacos with the hummus, tortillas, and avocados. It's not the worst thing I've ever made, and I definitely have leftovers for lunch tomorrow. I'm quite proud of myself! $57.60 7 p.m. — I clean up after dinner and continue making my way through the bottle of wine. I've been mulling over what to get my boss for Christmas, and I think a spa gift card would be the best, given how stressful her job can be sometimes. I online to find a nice spa near where my boss lives and go down a rabbit hole of a thousand options. I'm not from the East Coast and still feel intimidated trying to figure out where things are in New York City and how far places are from one another. I settle on a spa that I think will work, and they have a discount on gift cards where you get $20 off a $200 purchase. I go for it and check one holiday gift off my list. $180 Daily Total: $272",3,80
"9 a.m. — The bottle of wine from the night before got to me and I wake up late. I was already going to take the day off, given how many things I had to do. I get out of bed and take my dog for a walk before showering. We take a 45-minute trip around our little town and chat with a few neighbors along the way. I get back to my house and proceed to take a long, hot shower that changes everything. I blow dry my hair and then start making a to-do list of everything I need to accomplish. I start my first load of laundry and realize that I'm out of detergent. I run to the local store and grab Tide Pods and a kombucha, before speeding back to my house. $12.85 12 p.m. — I spend most of the morning doing laundry and other household cleaning tasks, and eat the leftover tacos for lunch while writing work emails. I need a midday caffeine pick me up and drive to the local café for my drip coffee with almond milk. I'm traveling tomorrow, so I spend the rest of my afternoon packing and cleaning. $3.40 6 p.m. — I promised one of my friends we'd have dinner this evening and she reminds me at 3 p.m. We pick a nicer local restaurant we both love, figuring that an early dinner would suit us well. I order the chicken parmesan and a glass of white and she orders the fish of the day special with a glass of red. We chat about her recent breakup, which has been a rough one, and each get another glass of wine. Two and half hours later, we move to another location and I offer to buy dinner as part of her Christmas present. We proceed to have another drink at a local wine bar, and I realize that I need to chill for a little bit before driving. We stay for another hour or so, and I drink water while my friend has another glass of wine. We split this bill, and I give her a ride home. $62 Daily Total: $78.25",4,80
"7 a.m. — It's another flight day, but at least this one doesn't start as early. The plane is landing at 11, so I don't need to be there until 10:30 a.m. I get up early to finish packing. My dog sitter has confirmed that she can stay at my house for the next few days, so I write her a thank you note and leave her a few details about my house. I also leave $150 (expensed) for her help. 9 a.m. — I give my dog a hug and get on the road. My car is at the quarter mark so I might as well fill up now instead of waiting until I land in a few days. My dad always taught me to never let my gas gauge get below half a tank during the winter, and it's something that stuck with me. I stop at the gas station to fill up, and grab a sugar-free Red Bull for the hell of it. ($28.72 expensed) 11 a.m. — The plane has landed and I'm waiting for the crew to finish the reset before boarding. My good friend and I used to work at my company's property in the Caribbean together, and she's flying down with me for a work reunion. We're having lunch on the plane but I'm starving and get a protein bar from the vending machine at the airport. This holds me over until we're able to take off. $1.60 2:30 p.m. — We land but we have to wait an hour for the next boat to take us to our final destination. We go to a local bar and each order a rum punch. The prices here are ridiculous, but they don't scrimp on the rum, so we're happy. We tip the bartender $3 each. $15 5 p.m. — We arrive and are greeted by old friends; I knew this was going to be a fun trip. We eat dinner at the bar on the dock; I order a grilled chicken wrap with a side salad and we have a few drinks. $55 Daily Total: $71.60",5,80
"9 a.m. — We wake up with hangovers and my friend suggests that a Bloody Mary (or two) is desperately needed. We head to our preferred local sand bar around 10 a.m. and find our favorite bartender working. We have a great time catching up, and he keeps the drinks flowing. We leave around 1 p.m. and when we ask for the bill, our bartender shrugs us off. We each leave $20 cash as a tip, and promise to come back later with everyone else. $20 2 p.m. — We call one of our friends to pick us up so we can go rent our golf cart. Because of inflation, the cost per day to rent an electric golf cart is $60 plus tax, which comes out to almost $65 exactly. We're going to have this cart for the next three days, so we split it evenly. $97.50 4 p.m. — We get our golf cart and then take a nap to reserve our energy. After waking up, our old roommate shows up to the house with fishing rods and tells us to go to the market for bait. We get in our cart, drive to the store, and get a box of squid for $10. On the way back, we stop by the liquor store to get a few bottles of wine. Again, prices are far higher here, so we ended up getting two bottles of rose for $29 each. $34.61 8 p.m. — We end up fishing into the dark, which is something my friend and I both love doing. Nothing is better than watching the sun set over the ocean. We end up having a beach bonfire with most of our good friends, and by 8, everyone is in a good mood. We pack up around 8:30 and tell everyone to meet us at the sand bar for dinner. We order enough food for a crowd: three pizzas, three dozen wings, two quesadillas, two orders of fish fingers, and three baskets of fries. C , I suppose. Someone in the group pays for all the food without us noticing, but my friend and I grab the bartender so at least we can pay for our drinks. Again, he gives us a major discount, and the total was only $12. We each give him a $20 and proceed to go home to bed. $20 Daily Total: $172.11",6,80
"8 a.m. — Wake up with an even greater hangover than the day before — but no Bloody Marys today. I need to get some work done in the morning before enjoying the rest of the afternoon. I take a walk on the beach in the morning to put my feet in the ocean before going back to the house to shower. When I get out of the shower, I feel 10 times better. My friend wakes up and we get breakfast ingredients from the local store. We buy eggs, ham, grits, and coffee, which turn into the ultimate breakfast of champions. We split the bill and I sit in the kitchen on my computer for a few hours while my friend makes breakfast. I chug a few glasses of water before grabbing coffee, and after breakfast I'm feeling almost back to normal. We sip on coffee throughout the morning while listening to NPR, and I wrap up my work for the day. $13 12 p.m. — Around noon, we change into our bathing suits and make our way to the dock. We're taking a boat trip around the area and we know it's going to be a good day. We each grab a vodka-grapefruit juice from the bar before getting on the boat. $10 2 p.m. — The boat trip itself was paid for by my company, but all of us tip our captain $30 each. We spend most of the day snorkeling, swimming, and fishing, and it is magical. $30 4 p.m. — Later in the afternoon, we stop at a inn and restaurant about 30 minutes from the one we're staying on. We order apps for everyone and one of our coworkers takes the bill. The inn has a very cute boutique, and all of us girls spent about 30 minutes shopping. I find a life-changing ring and happily to pay almost $90 for it. It's one of those statement pieces that one cannot live without. $86 Daily Total: $139",7,80
"8:30 a.m. — I eat breakfast at home almost every day, especially during the week. Today, I go for kefir with chia seeds, honey, granola, pumpkin seeds, and a sprinkle of bee pollen. My boyfriend is a saint and always makes me a coffee with the Chemex, usually before I even get out of bed. He pours mine into my new, reusable stainless steel Hydroflask travel mug because he knows I'll be on the go today. After breakfast, I drop my boyfriend off on campus where he works as a professor and Ph.D. student. 10 a.m. — I work two days a week as a nanny to help make ends meet. It's a great gig because the hours are pretty flexible and the child I take care of is very low-key. She's getting over a cold and takes two super-long naps today, giving me the opportunity to get reading out of the way for class later this week. 3 p.m. — The family I nanny for NEVER has any food in their house. By the time I'm done, I am starved as I forgot to bring a snack with me. I run around the corner from their house to a local coffee spot since I have a drink card there. I fill up my reusable mug and get a plain croissant to-go. $7 (including tip) 4 p.m. — I drive straight to campus, about 20 miles outside of the city, in order to make it to a meeting for a group presentation. I don't hit too much traffic, but it still takes me about 40 minutes. Everyone in the group is well-prepared and feeling confident. 5 p.m. — Another meeting. My department is in the interview stages of hiring a new professor and graduate students were asked to meet with each candidate. We're doing additional vetting and giving them a students' perspectives on life at the university. The candidate is very impressive — and there is also pizza, so I am stoked. I eat three giant slices, without shame. 9:15 p.m. — I make it home, planning to get more reading done for class, but instead I do yoga and Pilates at home. I used to pay for ClassPass or a gym membership, but I have been using YouTube as my primary source of physical activity for more than five years now; I find workout videos just as effective and motivating. I love Blogilates videos and I also follow a few yoga instructors. I do a 30-minute pilates video plus a quick, 15-minute yoga flow and feel so much more relaxed. Daily Total: $7",1,81
"9 a.m. — I wake up a little later than I meant to and have to rush to get ready. My boyfriend is still asleep and I forget to make myself a coffee with my breakfast of an egg and toast. I run to a local chain on my way out of town for a small black coffee. $3 11 a.m. — Make it to campus just in time for a meeting with my professor about questions I have on the readings for class this week. After, I head to the graduate student lounge at the library to get work done on an assignment due later this week. I bring leftover lentil soup with me but I'm not hungry and save it for later. 3:30 p.m. — I get home and try to apply myself to my readings for the next couple of hours. 5:30 p.m. — I'm suddenly starving, so I make brown rice to have with my leftover lentil soup. I love cooking and in the colder months, I try to make a big batch of soup once a week; that's an easy go-to when I'm too tired or busy to cook. Lentil is my favorite soup because it's pretty high in protein and I can throw in whatever vegetables we happen to have in the fridge. 8:30 p.m. — My boyfriend gets home and we head out on our weekly grocery rounds. We are both pretty picky about our groceries, so we go to both Trader Joe's and Whole Foods every week. At Trader Joe's, we stock up on apples, onions, garlic, ginger, peanut butter, crackers, pomegranate, RXBars, brown rice, pinto beans, potatoes, and butter. At Whole Foods, we buy eggs, kefir, coffee, roasted nuts in bulk, salad greens, kale, broccoli, goat cheese, and a frozen pizza. I've been a vegetarian for almost 14 years, but my boyfriend eats meat so we also grab veggie breakfast sausage, regular breakfast sausage, and ground beef. We split the groceries 50-50, and both end up spending $25 at each location. Before we leave Whole Foods, we both decide we are hungry. I buy us each a slice of pizza. $57.50 Daily Total: $60.50",2,81
"8:30 a.m. — I have a fried egg, toast, and veggie bacon for breakfast and my boyfriend makes me a coffee. I drop him off on campus and then head straight to campus myself. 12:30 p.m. — Hunkered down in the grad student lounge again, writing. I really hate buying food on campus because there aren't any good healthy options and it's all overpriced. I eat an RXBar and an apple that I brought from home. 5 p.m. — Exhausted, I make it home and veg out, watching an episode of before I start on dinner. I'm craving carbs so I make myself pasta and a huge green salad with goat cheese, broccoli, kale, tomatoes, and a homemade vinaigrette. 5:40 p.m. — My nannying schedule shifted this week so the parents can have a date night. I head over to their place, imagining a productive night of reading and writing. 8:45 p.m. — The baby is in a terrible mood because of her cold and needs tons of extra attention; my productive night quickly evaporates. She finally falls asleep after much back-rubbing, feeding, cradling, etc. I go downstairs to try to get work done but I can't find the monitor, and as a paranoid nanny, I feel the need to check on her every 30 minutes or so. I try to work but mostly I read random articles online until her parents get home. 11:20 p.m. — They are late but I don't really mind. Luckily, they round up and give me an extra hour's worth. I head home, wiped. Daily Total: $0",3,81
"8:30 a.m. — I wake up but stay in my pajamas. I have a big assignment due tonight and need to put the finishing touches on it before I can do anything else. I outline the rest of what I plan to write and make breakfast, more kefir with chia seeds, honey, pomegranate jewels, granola, pumpkin seeds, and bee pollen, plus a coffee. 1 p.m. — I finish and submit my assignment. I'm really on edge and I decide to do a workout to cut some of my stress. I use physical activity primarily for therapeutic purposes, but lately, I've been focusing on strength training after my boyfriend turned me on to kettlebell workouts. There are so many amazing kettlebell workout classes on YouTube. My favorites so far are on a channel called BodyFit by Amy. (This is not an ad. I just love this woman's workouts!) I do a 30-minute video and stretch for 10 minutes afterward. 2:30 p.m. — I think my new strength-training routine has amped up my metabolism because I'm ravenous. I spread goat cheese on toast, fry up an egg, and make two veggie sausages. 4:30 p.m. — I head to campus for one of my last classes of the semester. 8:45 p.m. — A few of my classmates decide to meet for beers after class as a celebratory end-of-semester shindig. I stop for gas on the way to the brewery. $15 9 p.m. — I'm so glad to have found a handful of interesting, intelligent, and funny people in my program to hang with. We talk about the program, Ph.D. applications, and conspiracy theories over beers and nachos. $19 Daily Total: $34",4,81
"9 a.m. — I sleep in a little this morning. I wake up and have peanut butter toast with a little bit of honey and bee pollen on top. My boyfriend makes us coffee and I drop him off on campus. 10:45 a.m. — I rush home, drop off the car, and hop on the SEPTA on my way to a doctor's appointment in Center City. I don't have a SEPTA card since I don't take the train that often, so I buy a single-trip ticket. This is my first real doctor's appointment in over five years. I know that sounds insane, but before I started working at my regular salaried job, I was on a form of Medicare that made it so difficult to see a regular practitioner that I avoided going to the doctor at all — even in cases where I probably really needed to. Now that I buy my insurance from the marketplace, I pay $98 out of pocket each month for my coverage (after the government subsidies). This takes a big hit on my monthly grad student budget, so I finally decided to take advantage of my PPO and make a long overdue well-woman appointment. $2.50 12:15 p.m. — I head back home on the train. $2.50 1:30 p.m. - I decide to squeeze in another workout. This time, I do a 25-minute kettlebell workout and a 20-minute yoga flow. After a quick shower, I am running later than I anticipated. I decide to grab a cup of black bean soup and a side salad to-go from my favorite local café before I head to campus. $10 (including tip) 8:30 p.m. — Mercifully, my professor lets us out early and I speed home. 9:15 p.m. — I make a snack of cheese, crackers, and an apple. I pour myself a very large glass of red wine and tuck in for a three-episode binge of the new season of on Netflix. I'm such a sucker for a good period piece, and Claire Foy, who plays Queen Elizabeth, is an amazing actress. My boyfriend gets home and we both hang on the couch, having quality screen time.

"10:30 a.m. — It's Saturday, so we wake up later than usual and lay in bed deciding whether to go out for brunch. 11:15 a.m. — We stay in since it just started snowing and we don't want to brave the cold yet. I make a breakfast salad inspired by my favorite breakfast spot in all of Philadelphia, the Hungry Pigeon. It has a hearty helping of breakfast potatoes, veggie sausage, and fried eggs over salad greens with bits of goat cheese mixed in. My boyfriend makes the coffee and fries up a regular sausage for himself. 12 p.m. — I get a notification that I've sold one of my listings on my Depop shop. I'm pleasantly surprised as it's one of my more expensive listings — $45.50 after Depop takes a 10% fee. Since I quit my job, I've been using Depop to sell clothes that I don't want or wear anymore. In addition to helping me cleanse my wardrobe, I use these funds to save up for my more frivolous expenses, like makeup or clothing. I am a super conscientious shopper, and when I'm not buying used or vintage, I usually try to buy myself one very nice thing each season from a designer or brand I love. (Here's lookin' at you, Dusen Dusen and Everlane.) The purchase has to hit a lot of criteria for it to be worth my investment: seasonless, unique, and high quality are key. This month, however, my Depop profits are going straight into my holiday gift shopping fund. 12:30 p.m. — After ""breakfast,"" we are ready to head out of the house to run errands. We drive into Center City to make a few returns and exchanges at Anthropologie and J.Crew. Though I'm tempted, I don't buy anything on my short list of holiday gifts. I am the opposite of an impulse shopper, and I still need to go home to read reviews and compare prices on everything I'm thinking of buying. At this point, I'm eyeing an overcoat for my boyfriend from COS; journals and fun pens for my sisters and my best friend from a local Philly print company called Print Fresh; a big candle or something simple for my boyfriend's parents; a set of special Christmas ornaments for my grandmother; and a pair of festive earrings and a candle for my mom. 2:30 p.m. — It's snowing really hard and we are both feeling festive and cozy. On our way home, we stop at a new café in our neighborhood for pastries and a hot chocolate; my boyfriend picks up the tab. 6:30 p.m. — Neither of us is very hungry, so I throw together salads of greens, roasted beets, goat's cheese, broccoli, and tomato for us with a homemade vinaigrette. Afterward, we snuggle up for a movie night. I make us stovetop popcorn with butter, salt, and a little smoked paprika. Daily Total: $0",6,81
"10:30 a.m. — My boyfriend goes on a bagel run so we can make breakfast sandwiches at home, one of my favorite weekend meals. We are running low on ingredients so we assemble our sandwiches with scrambled eggs, more goat cheese, kale, hot sauce, and our breakfast sausage of choice on the side. 12 p.m. — We head to a local coffee shop to camp out and get serious work done. I'm feeling fancy and order an almond milk latte and cover my boyfriend's plain hot coffee. $8 (including tip) 5 p.m. — After our work session, we drive over to West Philadelphia to see an exhibition at the Institute for Contemporary Art. On our way home, we debate going out for dinner and decide to swing by Whole Foods (again) to pick up basics that we're running low on: kefir, bread, eggs, cheese, and a few other essentials. We split the total. $17.59 Daily Total: $25.59",7,81
"6:40 a.m. — My alarm is going off and I'm mentally exhausted just thinking about everything I have to do today. I was up late editing wedding photos, and mentally planning a breakup text with Dave*, one of the guys I'm seeing. (I make maybe $450/month, but after transportation and car rentals, it kind of evens out to zero after expenses since I moved here. My last gig will be this summer.) 8 a.m. — Out of the shower and rushing to finish getting ready. I recently got curtain/fringe bangs and they've added 10 minutes to my morning routine, where I normally only take five. I feed the ninja cat and my 10-year-old, 100-pound German shepherd and schedule a dog walker on Wag because I'm running hella late. I have credits from referring friends, so it's only $14 today instead of $20. They'll be here in 20 minutes to grab her. $14 8:25 a.m. — Run out the door to grab my Lyft Line because it's raining and I don't feel like wasting my bang-crafting skills on a mile walk to the train in the mist. $3.04 9 a.m. — Get to the office and make my standard cup of coffee (heavy on the sugar with cream). I'm going through emails and texting with Eric, one of the guys I'm dating, while also using EveryDollar to track my spending and budget progress. Dating after divorce is weird AF, but I've met some really awesome guys — and a few not awesome ones. 1 p.m. — I'm starving in an, way. I'm working on eight open roles and they're all in the final closing stages, so things are hectic. I walk over to Whole Foods to grab a loaf of bread and some kind of snack. I have the taste buds of a five-year-old; I adore PB & Js and love to make those in the office for lunch. I end up with honey wheat bread, a block of cheddar jack cheese, and spoons for the office. I drink a Coke with my lunch, but I brought it from my home stash. $10.22 4:10 p.m. — I get a text from a Bumble guy I haven't met yet but have had great banter with for the past two weeks. He wants me to reserve Thursday for a real date for him. I answer with, ""Sure, where are we going?"" and he immediately suggests the restaurant where Dave bartends. Naturally. I quickly redirect him and ask to go somewhere less loud (and with fewer exes). He suggests one of my favorite spots, RM Champagne Salon in the West Loop. On the calendar now! 6 p.m. — I'm meeting a friend for dinner in River North close to Eric's place. I let him know, and he tells me to bring my dog over beforehand so she and his dog can have a playdate. Then, I can crash there instead of going back to my neighborhood late at night. Sold. Uber with the dog is $8.55, but I give the driver $5 in cash because of my pup. $13.55 7 p.m. — I meet my friend at a new restaurant in River North and we split an entrée and a small appetizer. We HATE the entrée and finish up to go to a different restaurant because we're both so put off. (Who puts dill and mint in pasta? Gross.) $15 for dessert including tip and $21 including tip for the food we hated. $36 9 p.m. — I leave the restaurant and grab a Lyft to Eric's. During the ride, I send a breakup text to Dave. We've gone round and round trying to make it work, but he pulled a classic move: love bombing in the beginning and cheating later. We backed up and tried to date casually, but even that imploded. Dating after divorce is so damn hard. $3.10 10 p.m. — Eric and I walk the dogs along the river and head up to his place. He lives in a gorgeous high-rise with amazing views. It's my first time staying over at his place so I have no idea what the morning rush will be like. Daily Total: $79.91",1,82
"7:20 a.m. — My alarm and Eric's are going off and I'm not ready. He takes the dogs out while I pop in the shower and try to get organized. I've got to catch the train, but I also need to get my dog home. Eric offers to let her stay at his place with his dog and I can grab her tonight. I quickly agree and he calls me an Uber so I can head out. Fingers crossed the dog behaves while he's at work! 9:05 a.m. — Settle in at my desk and pull up all my morning websites while the Keurig gets going. No reply from Dave on the breakup text, which is pretty much his MO. He'll pop up at 2 a.m. sometime in the next week, drunk and horny and wanting me to come over. That ship has sailed, mister. I notice in my checking account that Digit, my savings app, has made a few withdrawals for upcoming goals. I'm saving for a vacation as well as a big credit card payoff and it took out $35.67 and $49.98 for both goals. I love this app because it helps me save without making it too easy for me to pull the money back into my account. $85.65 10:45 a.m. — I just received two new roles and some serious validation. A candidate I didn't like (and who I felt was flaky) went around my back and got the job I was hiring for, so we only received 50% of the expected commission after negotiating with the company. They called to apologize because the hire is ruining their relationship with suppliers and they want me to replace this person. Extreme validation, y'all. Calls for a third cup of coffee. 12 p.m. — Bored in between calls and I don't want to eat my lunch too early, so I swipe on Bumble and chat with a few guys. That might sound weird since I'm upset over Dave and I was at Eric's last night, but if my divorce taught me anything, it's don't put all your eggs in one basket. Honestly, until Eric says he's ready, I'm not pushing for anything more than the easygoing time we're having. Plus, being on Bumble keeps me from online shopping. 1 p.m. — I'm wavering between buying soup from a French bakery and eating my PB & J. My throat hurts, and that seems like a solid enough reason to spring for the soup. The girl at the counter comments on my bangs so this soup was totally worth the self-esteem boost. I've needed it after dealing with Dave all week. I take it back upstairs, add some cheese, and call it a sick-day win. I pair it with chocolate milk I brought in last week; I'm a third grader for sure. $4.13 4:30 p.m. — Finish up calls and make a list of quick grabs at Jewel during my walk home. I take the Metra and then walk about a mile to my apartment where there's a Jewel-Osco a block over. I probably need to refill my birth control before Christmas break. I also add dry shampoo and adult Lunchables to the list. 6 p.m. — Kinda forgot my dog was at Eric's. I check in with him to see what his plans are and if my dog ate his apartment. He got home early and my text apparently woke him up from napping with the dogs on the couch. He needs to get a run in, so he volunteers to jog both dogs over to my place. I offer to have food ready so it's a plan. I have two and a half miles to clean and whip something up. 7 p.m. — Eric arrives with the pups and they are that wonderful level of tired where they settle in and start snoring. I made chicken sandwiches with avocado, bacon, arugula, and mayo all on Hawaiian bread. I also made a quick batch of sweet potato fries. Eric hangs out for a bit before setting off with his pup to jog home. I've already seen him once this week so twice is a lot and I don't push it. 8:30 p.m. — In bed with chocolate milk and binge-watching until it's time to pass out. Daily Total: $89.78",2,82
"7:30 a.m. — My alarm has been going off since 6 a.m., mostly because I woke up at 3:30 and wasn't able to fall back asleep for another two and a half hours. I am still a bit upset over Dave. He was my first real relationship after my divorce and it ended spectacularly bad. I also started my period a week early because I'm the girl that forgets to take her pill for two days and then tries to catch up. Lovely. 9 a.m. — I'm at my desk with coffee and peanut butter toast in hand. It's our office holiday party today so of course, I'm in leggings and an oversized sweater with three-day-old hair that I curled again in an attempt to look normal. I feel blah. I see that Acorns has initiated a $9.09 withdrawal to invest. On average, I put $75 to $100 into Acorns each month, depending on my spending. I've been rounding everything to the next dollar on checks so that instead of a few cents, it's taking a full dollar each time. Last year, I was able to put about $1,276 into Acorns just from roundups, and I got about $126 back in growth/dividends. I don't hate it. $9.09 9:15 a.m. – A candidate that was supposed to sign an offer letter last night emails to say he's pursuing a better offer in a different city. Wtf? Pissed does not begin to describe my emotions. This is three failed closings due to companies extending the interview process a month and a half or longer. 10 a.m. — Trying to cool my jets with coffee. Wag lets me know that my preferred walker will be walking a neighbor's dog and they can walk mine right after for a 20% discount. I planned on getting her an afternoon walk anyways, so the discount makes me glad I waited. $16 12 p.m. — My boss calls an Uber for us to go to the holiday lunch. There is a mix of dietary needs, so we've got a little bit of a ride to find a vegan and kosher restaurant this afternoon. 3:30 p.m. — Back in the office from lunch. (Our bosses treated.) A glass of wine and a ton of food has me feeling sleepy so I put on a new cup of coffee while going through my holiday bag, which is full of loot. Our bosses are awesome and they know the best gift is cash, so they stocked us up with gift cards and prepaid Visas. I kind of adore them. 4 p.m. – Just got a notification that the pup is home from her walk and a date confirms to meet at 8:30. I never made it to Jewel last night and I'm rocking old hair. I make an alert on my phone to grab dry shampoo, deodorant, and my birth control prescription on the walk home. 5:30 p.m. — Off the train and meeting a friend at Jewel to catch up before my date. I buy four Hillshire Farm small plates (the aforementioned adult Lunchable), a carton of chocolate milk, dry shampoo, deodorant, cough drops, and a four-pack of Reese's Peanut Butter Cups. Obviously, I'm a super health conscious adult. $29.79 7 p.m. — My date messages me on Bumble to ask me to send him more photos so he knows what I look like. There are six on Bumble, so WTF? I reply that the ones on there already are from the past two weeks. He never replies and un-matches me so I guess I don't have to go on this date! I wasn't really feeling it anyway so crisis averted. I put on warm gym clothes and meet my friend again to go for a four-mile walk on the 606. 9 p.m. — Chat with Eric a little; he's feeling pretty down and I feel for him. I'm coming to the realization that I can care without laying my own emotions on him because I know they'll get crushed at some point. Being an eternal optimist is not my thing apparently. I pass out and hope my head cold passes. Daily Total: $54.88",3,82
"7:30 a.m. — Alarm goes off and I feel like complete crap. My head hurts, my throat is sore, and I have no voice. Let the boss know I'm going to the MinuteClinic and I'll be working on the couch. Hoping I pull it together in time for my date tonight, since it's one I'm looking forward to. 9 a.m. — I wake up, make coffee, cut up an avocado on toasted Hawaiian bread, and sprinkle it with garlic salt. Maybe not the best sickbed food but it's working for me. 10:15 a.m. — Settled into working on the couch with all the animals surrounding me. I remember my phone bill is due and push the payment through on that. It's my final installment on my phone, so it should go down $45 next month. 1 p.m. — My friend and her roommate come to pick up my dog and take her on a run. I'm grateful for the chance to hop into the bath and try and steam this cold out. 4:15 p.m. — Run to Express to return a skirt and exchange it for more sweaters. I adore sweaters. The skirt cost more than the sweater, so I get $5.01 back on my debit card! 6:30 p.m. — In the Uber on my way to meet Jason for the first time. We've had awesome banter and I'm freaking nervous. (Plus, it's my first date with bangs.) He shows up and sweet Jesus, he's a normal, handsome human being. What do I do with my hands? My face? What do I talk about? $3.76 8:30 p.m. — We leave the first bar and walk to a quieter one for food and more drinks. We're doing that thing where we walk and kind of bump into each other, and it's making me melt. 11:30 p.m. — The date is wrapping up and it went well — to the point we both acknowledged it. I offer to split the cost of the meal and the wine, but he staunchly refuses. My Uber Pool shows up and we kiss and part ways. 11:40 p.m. – My Uber Pool is stopping at Dave's workplace. We are PICKING SOMEONE UP FROM Dave's workplace. Why?! 11:45 p.m. – It's one of the cooks and he knows me. We chat, he asks how everything is going, and what my and Dave's plans are for the holidays. I slowly turn my head, give him a strange look, and explain that Dave and I aren't together because he essentially ghosted from a six-month relationship. Awkward silence ensues the rest of the way home. My life, y'all. My life. $3.45 Daily Total: $7.21",4,82
"7 a.m. — I'm awake and I feel a little better, so I snooze until about 7:30 and then hop out of bed. I've discovered that second-day bangs are the best so I curl my hair, fluff the bangs, and walk the pup. I pack one of the adult Lunchables and my cough drops into my purse and head out to the train. I'm leaving 10 minutes early because I'd like to walk slowly versus having to hurry while wearing my new over-the-knee boots. 12 p.m. — Starting to feel hungry but also still sick. Haven't heard from Jason yet, and after having a husband and my most recent boyfriend disappear from relationships, I'm a little gun shy. We did text a while after I got home last night, so I definitely don't think I've heard the last of him. I'm also a little anxious because I think I may hear from Dave today after bumping into his friend in the Uber last night. 12:15 p.m. — Committing to putting something in my stomach, I eat the Lunchable and drink the rest of my chocolate milk. Everyone else has left the office by a quarter-to-one so, and I wrap up phone calls and clean my desk. 3 p.m. — My boss texts to let me out early and I run to catch the 3 p.m. train home! 3:15 p.m. – I knew it! I knew I'd hear from Dave — and of course, it was bullshit on top of bullshit. He's mad that I went on dates in the off phases of our relationship, but he can't pinpoint anything specific. Really, he's just mad that I accepted him ghosting and went on a great date instead. We continue to text fight for the next hour. 4:30 p.m. — I make a chicken salad sandwich and tell Dave to mail my things. I deserve a lot better than someone who disappears when he's mad. 6 p.m. — Meet my friend and her roommates for dinner and we chow down on enchiladas and wine. We take turns cooking and this week is hers, so I've successfully avoided buying dinner before going out. 8 p.m. — We play Cards Against Humanity and I notice that even though Dave swears he's done with me, he's aggressively looking through what I'm doing on social media. Someone send help. 10 p.m. – We load into an Uber and head to Old Crow, my favorite country bar in Chicago. One friend gets Uber for free through work, so we enjoy that perk as we head out. 2 a.m. – One friend and I are the last two people standing and we dance to modern country music until our feet hurt. We close our tabs ($22.45 including tip for three ciders) and call an Uber to go home. I'm so grateful for how awesome my friends are here that I don't even miss Dave. I cover the Uber ($4.55). $27 2:30 a.m. – Lay in bed and chat with Eric a little. He's considering coming home with me for Christmas and I hope he does. He worries about me when I'm out and checks to make sure I'm okay when I'm having a bad day. He's secretly the one I've got my hopes riding on. Daily Total: $27",5,82
"9:30 a.m. — I slept in and enjoyed every blissful second of it. After being out last night and being upset about Dave, I'm ready for a relaxing weekend. I make a breakfast of eggs, bacon, an avocado, and a mushroom, onion, and sweet potato hash with coffee and chocolate milk. I make a triple serving of the hash because I'll eat it with lunch throughout the week. 12 p.m. — I've showered and straightened my hair and fixed my makeup. (I've become extremely proficient at showering without messing up either and using dry shampoo to extend my blowouts.) I meet up with one of my girlfriends to shop the Express sweater sale. Between my coupons and gift cards, I score four sweaters for $40, which I'll take any day! We stop by Starbucks on our walk back and I grab a Grande flat white. I've still got a gift card so it's free for me today! $40.98 3 p.m. — I've got a date tonight with Shawn, my roommate's boyfriend's boss tonight, at a swanky Italian place downtown. I both love and hate dating, and I always seem to be ensnarled with some guy who is broken, meaning I'm super nervous. Eric has a holiday party tonight near his ex-fiancé's apartment and he's stressed out, so we chat to help each other calm down. He knows I'm going on a date and he respects it. 7 p.m. — Hop in a Lyft, which is surging because it's holiday season in Chicago. I refuse to pay $17 to go downtown so I go with Lyft Line, which is still higher than normal. $7.56 11:45 p.m. — We're just leaving the date and we pretty much shut the restaurant down. He was a ton of fun, we had several apps and entrees, and three bottles of wine which he let me pick so overall the meal was amazing. I offered to split the $380 tab, but was politely told not to worry about it. I'm from the South and I love a gentleman, but what's interesting to me is more men in Atlanta took me up on splitting the check than men do in Chicago. I've only had one man let me in my six months here, and I think it's because neither of us was feeling it. 1 a.m. – We head up to a rooftop bar for a nightcap although he has to get up early in the morning. He grabs the check while I'm in the bathroom. 2 a.m. — Eric is texting me and he is drunk and upset. An amazing guy helped me through everything when my life blew up last year, so I feel like I'm restocking karma by being there for Eric. I meet him at a swanky bar ($4.07 on Uber) where he and some coworkers have ordered bottle service. I help them finish it off. Eric grabs the Uber to his place. $4.07 Daily Total: $52.61",6,82
"8:40 a.m. — Ugh. We're up so early for a Sunday but it's fine... Okay, not really. I put up a decent argument about why we should stay in bed. Eric normally doesn't let me spend the night, which I respect, so this is our second time waking up together — and first on the weekend — so I'm treading lightly. We take his pup out for a walk on the riverfront and then come back to bed. I have no interest in getting going early. 10:30 a.m. — We're up and moving to the couch for a marathon and breakfast. I get a nasty text from Dave because to him, a breakup is never really a breakup and he knows I'm not at my apartment. 11:30 a.m. — We're finishing coffee and Eric is feeling a little overwhelmed. I've got brunch with the girls at Mott St. at 12:45, so I get ready to head out. Eric calls me an Uber and walks me downstairs. We're in a weird place but it's a nice mix of romance and friendship without feeling weighed down by expectations. 12:30 p.m. — I am so ready for brunch. Mott St. is my favorite place, so I settle in with the girls and we catch up on dates, boys, and ridiculous Saturday night shenanigans. We each have our own entrée and a Bloody Mary. My pork belly eggs Benny was amazing and totally hit the spot. $28.77 2 p.m. – I settle in to finish up some work I do on the side for extra cash and binge-watch my newest show, . The pup is passed out and my cat is purring on my lap, so I immediately fall asleep instead of being productive. I wake up to a text from Shawn saying that he had fun as well on our date. We text for a few minutes before I fall back asleep. 5 p.m. — I'm at that point on a Sunday evening where I have to decide if I'm going to meet a new Bumble boy for a drink or stay in my yoga pants. I commit to my yoga pants and working, and order pizza from Papa John's with a code for free delivery. I tip $4 cash to the driver. $13.67 7:30 p.m. — I shoot out a text to the girls from brunch asking who wants to walk off dinner. One of them lives nearby and says yes but that she needs food, and as luck would have it, I happen to have a pizza! She snags a slice and we meet our other friend at the 606 with our pups to get about three miles of walking and gossiping in. I adore the new friendships I've been able to make in this new, post-divorce life in a big city. 11:30 p.m. — I finally finish my side-hustle work and have a quick FaceTime with Eric before hitting the bed. I'm exhausted and weirdly emotional from my week of juggling men. In the really quiet moments when I'm in bed by myself falling asleep, I miss my ex-husband. Tonight is no exception, and I know I probably won't sleep that well. Daily Total: $42.44",7,82
"6:30 a.m. — My alarm goes off and I snooze it twice until 6:50, which is the absolute latest I can get up and still get to work on time. I let my dogs out, feed them, and then get ready for the day. After showering and spending way too long trying to get the perfect top-knot, I rush out the door and am on my way to the office. 7:50 a.m. — Notice my car is running low on gas and make a mental note to stop at Costco on my way home from work. 8:05 a.m. — Arrive to work only a few minutes late. Someone brought in mini-donuts and I take two to eat with my protein shake for breakfast. I keep a few days' worth of breakfast, lunch, and snacks in the office fridge and replenish that every few days to avoid spending money on takeout. I also fill up my water bottle to sip on throughout the day. 10 a.m. — Morning meetings are finished, and it looks like it's going to be a pretty light day. I'm feeling a bit snacky, so I eat a banana I brought from home and the last handful of Chex Mix that's in my desk drawer. 11 a.m. — My work bestie and I decide to run to the grocery store to pick up a few things she needs. I offer to drive so I can get gas while we're out, and I stop at Costco to fill up my very thirsty car. $32.49 11:20 a.m. — We enjoy our time out of the office, walking around the grocery store. I don't really need any groceries but I do find GIANT kiwis that are on sale and look too good to pass up ($2.59). I also buy a bridal shower card ($4.99) for a friend. $7.58 12 p.m. — Back at the office and feeling pretty hungry. Lunch today is half of a bagel (left over from an office party earlier this week), veggies and hummus, and a snack-size bag of Doritos from my desk drawer. 2 p.m. — I realize I haven't been drinking very much water today and refill my water bottle. When I get back to my office, I text my boyfriend to see how his day is going. He's in medical school and has been on call this whole week, so I haven't seen him very much. He replies that he has been feeling sick all day, but is planning on coming over tonight once he finishes up at the hospital. 4:30 p.m. — Done with work for the day. On my way home, I stop at Walgreens to pick up photos I ordered to be printed. Thanks to an awesome online coupon code, I get them for a steal. $4.99 5 p.m. — I'm finally home and my dogs are so happy to see me! I let them out and walk around my yard for a while. Once we're back inside, I feed them dinner and start hanging up clothes in my bedroom. My closet periodically explodes and after a few days of living in the chaos of clothes, shoes, and handbags everywhere, I'm relieved to finally put everything away. 5:30 p.m. — Boyfriend is home early! He doesn't officially live with me yet but has been slowly moving his stuff here over the last few months since he spends most of his nights here. I give him some kisses and then make us dinner: leftover beef brisket for him and leftover rotisserie chicken for me. 7:45 p.m. — Boyfriend passes TF out in a heap of dogs and blankets, leaving me to fend for myself for the remainder of the evening. I start cleaning the house and then go through a huge pile of mail on my desk. In the process, I decide to peruse Amazon and find anti-tarnish jewelry bags I . Free next-day shipping? Yes, please! ($4) I also decide to pay off my credit card early this month because the statement balance is giving me anxiety. I transfer $10,000 from savings to checking to pay off the card and replenish my checking account. $4 11:15 p.m. — After watching Netflix, I decide it's time to call it a night and go to bed.

"5 a.m. — Wake up to boyfriend's alarm and a coughing and congested boyfriend. I'm too sleepy and cozy to get up, so I fall back asleep while he gets ready. 6:30 a.m. — Boyfriend wakes me up to kiss me goodbye and I get up to feed and let the dogs out. While they eat, I turn on some tunes and hop in the shower. I started a new skincare routine recently and look forward to using all my new products each morning. Up until a few weeks ago, I had never used toner before and WOW, what a difference it makes! 7:45 a.m. — I'm running late as usual but decide to make a smoothie with fruit in my fridge that's getting overripe. I have a Vitamix and it's my most-used appliance by far. It's definitely an investment, but I can make everything from almond butter to soup — and of course smoothies. One strawberry-banana-pineapple smoothie later, I say goodbye to my pups for the day and drive to work. 8:30 a.m. — I sip on my smoothie with a side of leftover donut holes as I read through emails. I only have to work until around noon today, but next week is really busy with client meetings. I want to get as much done as possible so I don't feel stressed next week. 10:30 a.m. — Boyfriend and I have been looking at engagement rings recently and found a few options we're considering. I receive a call from the jeweler we're working with and make plans to meet with her after work. 12:30 p.m. — I'm done with work for the day and head over to the jewelry store. Boyfriend and I are forgoing tradition when it comes buying my engagement ring. He has a ton of medical school debt and won't actually be making any money until he begins residency next year. We want to get engaged soon, so while we agreed to split the cost of the ring, I'm actually going to be paying for it in its entirety; he'll pay me his half once he has a job. 1 p.m. — I'm meeting with my awesome jeweler and am able to narrow the options down to two different settings and two different diamonds. I'll be back tomorrow with my boyfriend and he'll make the final decision. 2:30 p.m. — Stop at the grocery store on my way home to pick up dessert to bring to a family party tomorrow night. It's that time of year, so there's pumpkin pie galore! ($8.40) Also notice a Christmas-themed headband with cat ears on it, which seems like a necessary purchase, and add that to my cart as well ($12.49). You never know when you might need to wear a headband with cat ears, and I always like to be prepared. $20.89 6 p.m. — Boyfriend is home, exhausted, and still sick. We usually go out for dinner on Fridays but decide to make do with what we have in the fridge. He eats leftover taco dip and butternut squash ravioli, and I have rotisserie chicken again with French bread. 10:30 p.m. — We end our day after watching a few episodes of and cuddling on the couch with the pups. He's tired, I'm tired, and we turn in earlier than usual. Daily Total: $20.89",2,83
"7:30 a.m. — It's the weekend! I sleep in and spend time browsing Instagram and getting all of the puppy snuggles. Boyfriend already left for the hospital for the day but will hopefully be back early this afternoon. 8:30 a.m. — I finally get out of bed to let the dogs out and feed them, before making an egg sandwich for breakfast. Aside from my Vitamix, my egg sandwich maker is my second most-used appliance. 12:30 p.m. — The house is clean, the laundry is done, and I'm hungry. I text boyfriend to see when he will be home and make lunch in the meantime. We're going to a family party tonight where there will be plenty of unhealthy food choices, so I make a salad with random ingredients I have in the fridge. I watch YouTube videos while I munch. 1:30 p.m. — Boyfriend is finished at the hospital. We decide to meet at the jewelry store to finalize the engagement ring purchase since it's on his way home and we're short on time. 3 p.m. — We found the ring! Boyfriend and I both ended up liking the same diamond and setting, and I'm so excited to take the next step with him. He's the best. I have tiny, infant-like fingers so my ring has to be specially ordered and won't be ready for six to eight weeks. Twenty percent down is due today, and I plan to pay the remaining balance off over the next few weeks. We ask the jeweler to call my boyfriend when it's ready so he can pick it up and still have some element of surprise for the engagement. $2,800 4:30 p.m. — Boyfriend and I are rushing to get to the party on time, and I realize I forgot Cool Whip for the pie. We stop at the grocery store on the way so I can get some, along with my favorite frozen Red's burritos that are on sale. $7.45 8 p.m. — Thoroughly enjoying ourselves with my family, eating good food, laughing, and talking. We eat our weight in pizza and snacks my parents bought and enjoy the dessert I brought. Boyfriend has one too many glasses of wine and ends up spilling red wine on himself and my cousin's nice, fluffy rug. We will likely not be invited back anytime soon. 11 p.m. — We're home and snuggle in bed with the pups and watch Netflix before falling asleep. Daily Total: $2,807.45",3,83
"9 a.m. — I wake up to the soft cries of my dogs who desperately have to pee, so I get up to let them both out. If they could talk, I'm sure they'd be cursing me because I slept in so late. Boyfriend got up around 5 and has already been at the hospital for a few hours. I take out turkey chili from the freezer to thaw for dinner tonight. I usually make a crockpot full every few months, portion it out, and freeze it. 9:30 a.m. — I make scrambled eggs and turkey bacon for breakfast and watch YouTube videos on my phone while I eat. I receive a text from my parents reminding me to book my flight for our upcoming family vacation to Florida. When confirming the dates with them, I realize we're leaving on my boyfriend's birthday. Worst. Girlfriend. Ever. 10:30 a.m. — Why is air travel so expensive?! I book a Southwest flight to Florida and call my parents to let them know. After I get off the phone, I schedule boarding for my dogs. When I travel, my parents are usually the ones who watch my pups, but since we will all be gone it's off to the kennel they go. I'm quoted nearly $600 (yikes!), but I don't have to pay until the day I drop them off. $393.95 11:30 a.m. — Decide to start decluttering my bathroom cabinets. It's amazing how many products one girl can accumulate, and even more amazing how few are actually used on a daily basis. I fill a couple of bags: one to donate, one to throw out. I also clear an entire shelf and drawer for boyfriend's things so he doesn't have to keep shoving his stuff in a small travel bag. 1 p.m. — I heat up one of the frozen burritos I bought yesterday for lunch and sit down to watch Netflix. I've recently become hooked on and I plan to spend a couple of hours vegging out and relaxing. 4:30 p.m. — After wasting much more of the day than I should have, I decide to get some exercise and take my dogs for a walk. It's so cold outside; winter is coming! My dogs weigh about 25 pounds combined, but when we walk, they manage to pull me along like a 100-pound Labrador. 5:15 p.m. — I'm back from our walk and start meal prepping for the week. I make overnight oats for breakfast, egg sandwiches for lunch, and cut up peppers and sugar snap peas for snacks. I also pack extra protein shakes, apples, and oranges, and a few pieces of chocolate for when 3 o'clock rolls around and I need my sugar fix. 6:30 p.m. — Boyfriend is home from the hospital and looks exhausted. I heat up the chili from the freezer for us and pack lunch for him for tomorrow. He's getting homemade zucchini bread, Greek yogurt, chili, and a banana. Once the chili is ready, we eat together and catch up on our days. 8 p.m. — After cleaning up the kitchen, we settle on the couch with the pups and watch . We both pass out about 30 minutes into the movie and decide to give up and go to bed early. Daily Total: $393.95",4,83
"5 a.m. — Did I mention how much I hate my boyfriend's alarm clock? It's so loud, and it goes off so. Early. 6:30 a.m. — Time to get up! I reluctantly crawl out of bed to let the pups out. After they do their doggie business and I feed them, I hop in the shower to get ready for work. Boyfriend is still home and offers to make me breakfast since we have some very ripe bananas we need to use up. Banana pancakes for the win! 8:11 a.m. — Arrive to work an put my meals for the week away in the fridge. I read through emails from the weekend and chat with some of my coworkers. Today is a busy day with five client meetings back to back and a client event tonight. 1:15 p.m. — My office ordered lunch from Panera and I have time in between meetings to chow down. I usually get a ton of free food at work; someone always seems to bring something in or buy lunch for everyone. I ordered a chicken Caesar salad with a ton of toppings and it is so delicious! 1:30 p.m. — While eating lunch, I peruse the Nordstrom website and notice that a Michele watch I've been eyeing for over a year is deeply discounted. I know I probably shouldn't do it, but I can't pass it up and add it to my cart ($1,678.43). I also place a large Amazon order of Christmas presents for my boyfriend. I go a bit overboard this year, but the guy needs everything! I buy him new Asics running shoes, Bogs winter boots, work ties, and new shirts ($285.18). $1,963.61 4:30 p.m. — I wrap up at the office for the day and head to the venue for the client event tonight. It's at a nice bar, but since I don't drink I'm going to socialize and make sure everyone else has a good time. 6 p.m. — Enjoying my guilty pleasure, Diet Coke. There's a bunch of yummy hors-d'oeuvres for me to munch on, too. I eat enough for a respectable dinner. 9:15 p.m. — Finally home. My parents are watching my dogs for me, and my boyfriend is working overnight at the hospital so I'm all alone. It's eerily quiet in my house so I turn on the TV for background noise while I clean up around the house. 10:45 p.m. — In bed and browsing Facebook, and notice my local movie theater is offering $5 Christmas movies for the next month. My boyfriend and I love and so I buy tickets for us for two different weekends. $20 11:15 p.m. — I can't keep my eyes open anymore; bedtime. Daily Total: $1,983.61",5,83
"5:15 a.m. — I have to be to the office for an early meeting. I get up, shower, and get ready. It's going to be another busy day and I plan to do some Christmas shopping for my family after work. 8 a.m. — I finish my first client meeting of the day and eat the overnight oats I brought from home. They're SO good. I text my boyfriend good morning and read through emails. 12:15 p.m. — A few client meetings later and it's time for lunch. I'm not in the mood for the egg sandwiches I made so I eat a frozen microwaveable meal I've had at the office for a month too long. It tastes pretty bad and I end up throwing half of it out and snacking on other things in my office drawer — a combination of pistachios and turkey jerky. I also eat one of the oranges I brought from home. 4 p.m. — I finish my last meeting of the day a little early and head out to go Christmas shopping. I go to TJ Maxx to find things for my parents. I get my mom a bracelet, a pair of dressy winter gloves, chocolates she likes, and a candle ($55.35). There is literally nothing here for my dad. I also buy a few home decor items and ornaments. $117.85 6:15 p.m. — On my way home, I stop at the pet supply store to buy dog food. I have a buy one, get one free coupon that expires today and want to make sure it doesn't go to waste. I resist the urge to buy the dogs more squeaky toys that they absolutely do not need. $35.43 6:30 p.m. — I'm home! After unloading my car, I preheat the oven and get out the ingredients to make garlic bread. Once that's baking, I heat up some turkey meat sauce I had in the freezer. Boyfriend has been home for a while and is functioning surprisingly well on very little sleep. We eat together and then play with the dogs. 7:45 p.m. — After cleaning up the kitchen, I do laundry while boyfriend packs. He is leaving tomorrow for a residency program interview, literally across the country. It's crazy to think that this time next year, we could potentially be living in an entirely different state, with new jobs and a new home. We're really hoping to stay in the Midwest but don't have complete control over the situation; it's unnerving not knowing. 9 p.m. — Boyfriend and I relax on the couch and watch some episodes of . We end most of our evenings this way and I'm sure going to miss him over the next week. 11 p.m. — Snoozin' time. Daily Total: $153.28",6,83
"6:50 a.m. — We sleep in too much today! My boyfriend lets the dogs out and feeds them while I rush around to get ready for work. It's going to be a messy bun, minimal makeup kind of day. 8:10 a.m. — Get to work and eat some overnight oats while I check emails. One of my coworkers comes in and asks me to chip in for Christmas gifts for my boss. $20 8:15 a.m. — One of the emails I receive lets me know a professional designation I hold needs to be renewed. I pay the renewal fee with my personal credit card but will be reimbursed later by my employer. ($99 expensed) 11 a.m. — I'm already hungry and it's not even noon. That's what I get for not drinking my protein shake. I snack on pistachios and an apple to try to tide myself over for the next few hours. Only a few more meetings to go. 2 p.m. — I heat up an egg sandwich and take it back to my desk for lunch. While I'm eating, I text my boyfriend as he waits at the airport for his flight to leave. I also sign up to volunteer tomorrow night after work. I tend to volunteer a lot more when he's not around to keep myself busy and distracted in the evening. Coming home to an empty house when you're not used to it isn't fun! 4 p.m. — I finish my last meeting of the day. I want to stop at a few stores for Christmas presents before I go to my personal training session, so I leave work a bit early. 4:30 p.m. — I'm at a different TJ Maxx and they have a ton of good stuff! I pick up a few more things for my boyfriend and mom. The find of the evening? A mug with a cat wearing a sweater that says ""Meowy Christmas"" on it! I still am not able to find anything for my dad, and it looks like I'll have to order his presents online. I also find some more home decor items for Christmas. $171.82 5:30 p.m. — Make a quick stop at Target to look around, vowing to not get sucked into the Target vortex. (The one where you leave with $200 worth of stuff after only coming in for one thing.) I successfully walk out of the store having spent nothing! 6 p.m. — Time for a session with a personal trainer I've been working with the past couple of months. I pre-pay for four sessions at a time and then schedule them as needed. We've been working on improving my flexibility. I don't get to the gym as often as I should, so a lot of my body parts make intense cracking noises as I work with her. 6:45 p.m. — Finally home for the evening! I don't know what to eat for dinner so I preheat the oven and throw in a frozen pizza. While it's cooking, I play with my pups. They're pretty wound up tonight even though my boyfriend was home with them for the better part of the day. One of my dogs uses me as a trampoline and launches herself off of me onto the couch. I think she may be half baby goat. 7:05 p.m. — My pizza is done and I'm comfortably settled into my usual spot on the couch surrounded by dogs. I'm not in the mood to watch 's tonight, so I opt for the movie . (Reese Witherspoon is goals.) 10:30 p.m. — It's perfectly acceptable to eat Pumpkin Spice Cheerios this late at night, right? After a snack, I lay in bed browsing Instagram until sleepiness overtakes me and I pass out. Daily Total: $191.82",7,83
"9:30 a.m. — I hear some neighbors outside and my roommate up and about. I decide it's time to start the weekend. I'm usually a very early bird — I love to get up before the sun and have time for quiet, coffee, breakfast, etc. — but I was up really late last night and slept in today. 9:45 a.m. — Make a pot of coffee and heat up breakfast. I have leftover whole-wheat banana bread topped with peanut butter, plus an orange and some sesame honey cashews. And coffee. I bring it back to bed and eat while I read a few articles and catch up on Bravo shows I've missed this week. Not a bad start to the day! 11:30 a.m. — Text my friend about our plans for the afternoon. She's my best friend and lives right down the block from me, but we've both had busy weeks and haven't seen each other. I'm ready for some girl time! 11:45 a.m. — Swing by the library to pick up the books I had on hold (a biography of Franklin D. Roosevelt and two cookbooks) since I have a few minutes before my friend is ready to go. 12 p.m. — Parking is crazy where we planned to go, so we detour to a local brewery we've never been to. It was a little bit of a hike but the beer was awesome. We chat about the book she's writing and admire the strangely violent murals on the walls. I pay. $23 3 p.m. — I'm hangry when I get home, so I make the quickest thing I can think of: rye toast and eggs scrambled with cheddar cheese, and hazelnut chocolate for dessert. 4 p.m. — I've been feeling super strange lately, kind of unsure of myself, insecure, self-critical, like I don't even know myself or what I want. Even though I love spending time with my best friend, she is so sure of herself and confident that I sometimes feel unsteady in comparison. I remind myself to contact a counseling office I've bookmarked to schedule an appointment. I can't tell if these are normal late-20s feelings or if I'm really struggling. I turn on to comfort myself and try not to get too wrapped up in my head. I've gotta get it together for a date tonight! 4:15 p.m. — I spontaneously buy the 1 Second Everyday app after seeing an adorable video on someone's Instagram story. I have no idea what to take videos of though! I guess this will challenge me to be creative. I'll start tomorrow. $5.28 5 p.m. — Hop in the shower and get ready for my date. I cannot decide what to wear (see struggling feelings above) and try on approximately three outfits before settling on an old faithful: a black jumpsuit with a chunky cardigan. Curl my hair and put on a little makeup. 5:30 p.m. — My date is cooking steak fajitas for dinner, and I'm in charge of bringing chips and salsa. I swing by the store on the way and get them both, plus a pack of gum for my purse. $8.97 10:30 p.m. — Home! I had a good time on the date but am having a hard time figuring out if I like this guy and can see long-term potential. I feel like having to think to hard about it probably does not bode well. I eat a little more chocolate before crashing. Daily Total: $37.25",1,84
"8:30 a.m. — Wake up, make coffee, and toast a TJ's multigrain bagel for breakfast. I put clarified french butter on one side (I don't even know what really this is, but damn is it good!) and peanut butter on the other. I also grab an apple. Somehow, I threw out my back between last night and this morning, so I hobble around a little bit. I scheduled a barre class through ClassPass for later today. If I cancel, I have to pay a fee of $15 so I hope it feels better soon. 9 a.m. — I hop in the car to run to a few grocery stores. It's a long weekend and I want to do a bunch of cooking projects, so I need to stock up and get the best prices! I drive 20 minutes or so out to the best Aldi in Virginia and get ingredients for my recipes and some other essentials for the week ($60.80). I also stop at Target for paper towels, sponges, and one of those assorted cereal packs my family used to bring on vacation. I'm going to make cereal milk ice cream! ($11.59) The last stop is Trader Joe's for frozen leeks, broccoli florets, parsnips, and heavy cream ($12.14). $84.53 11 a.m. — I turn on Spotfiy, unpack the groceries, and start on the base for the cereal milk ice cream. 11:30 a.m. — My friends and I spent a week at the beach together last year, and it was so fun that we're doing it again this year! I'm in charge of coordinating/booking. I send out an email to the group with logistics and ask them to Venmo me their share of the rental, which I put on my credit card last week. 1:30 p.m. — Made it through barre class without throwing out my back. Small victories. 2 p.m. — Random lunch full of things in the fridge: a big kale salad with cranberries, goat cheese, almonds, and sweet potatoes with homemade vinaigrette, plus a kiwi. 2:30 p.m. — I make a batch of cereal milk ice cream (I dream of opening my own ice cream shop one day!), with a cereal crumble to mix in. I let everything sit in the fridge overnight. I'll churn it tomorrow. 5 p.m. — Make an early dinner of Trader Joe's frozen cauliflower fried rice with a scrambled egg added and kung pao chicken, both topped with sriracha. I love that this meal crushes my takeout cravings at a fraction of the cost, and with more veggies to boot. 5:30 p.m. — I have a shift at the restaurant tonight, so I shower, get ready, and drive over there. I would love to stay home or go out for a beer with my friend, but I remind myself that this money will help pay for my beach trip! Plus, we don't have school tomorrow because it's MLK Jr. Day, so I can sleep in a little. 12:15 a.m. — Home, and so damn tired. I wash my face, put on PJs, and head to bed. Daily Total: $84.53",2,84
"8:15 a.m. — Up and at 'em! I'm feeling strangely motivated when I wake up, so after I put in my contacts, wash my face, and brush my teeth, I do a deep clean of the bathroom and throw in a load of laundry. Then on to coffee and a comforting bowl of oatmeal with bananas, dates, chia, flax, and peanut butter. I also churn the ice cream I made yesterday and stick it in the freezer. 9 a.m. — I'm feeling stressed about this beach trip. I kind of wish that I hadn't agreed to it and had instead devoted the money to a new trip somewhere different this year, but I got swept in. This was an instance when I definitely could have practiced being more assertive instead of going with the flow, which is my natural inclination. I know it will be a ton of fun when I get there, though. 9:30 a.m. — Wash the huge pile of dishes in the sink, then do some more cooking for the week: Joy the Baker's turkey meatballs, broccoli with garlic and olive oil, and farro. 11 a.m. — Shower and get ready for the day. I drive downtown to spend the afternoon in a few of my favorite Smithsonian museums, but as soon as I get there I realize that may not be possible. There is not single a parking spot to be found for blocks! I'm still glad to drive around and swing by the Dr. MLK Jr. memorial on this holiday. 12:15 p.m. — Instead of my museum plan, I take myself out to one of my favorite restaurants for a burger and a toasted marshmallow milkshake. Seriously, it's heaven on earth. I didn't order fries but I think the cashier made a mistake (or was really nice/flirty!) and gave me some! I sit by the window and read my book, , and people watch while I eat. I leave feeling full but satisfied. $13.89 2 p.m. — Call my dad on the drive home and vent about feeling down. He is a great listener and knows exactly what to say. 2:30 p.m. — Take a long, hot bubble bath with my book and a can of sparkling water — one of my favorite self-care activities. I also spend like 15 minutes (read: crying uncontrollably), but I feel a lot better after. 3:15 p.m. — Paint my nails and watch a few episodes of . Why didn't I start this show sooner?! The script, wardrobe, and acting are all so good. Also, Tony Shalhoub! 5:15 p.m. — Snack on an apple, still kind of full from lunch. Feeling fancy, I put on two face masks in a row — a fun, peel-off one followed by one from The Ordinary that makes me look like a newborn alien. 7 p.m. — Prep snacks for me and my friend to eat; she's coming over to watch tonight. I cut up veggies, cheese, leftover banana bread, and pop a big bowl of stovetop popcorn. I never watch on the night of, so this is a treat! I also definitely need some social time (but there was no way was I putting on a bra and/or real pants again today). 10 p.m. — I love my friend. She gives great advice and is so funny and supportive. We had a blast judging Arie's awkward kisses and catching up on each other's weeks. 10:30 p.m. — My nighttime skincare routine is already done; all that's left is to take out my contacts and hop into bed. Getting up for work tomorrow will not be easy… Daily Total: $13.89",3,84
"5:45 a.m. — Wake up and get going with the morning routine. Put my contacts in, remember to take my calcium pill (I never know if it helps), wash my face, etc. I put on a pot of coffee and make my bed, then start putting on skincare stuff and decide on an outfit and breakfast. It's going to be a balmy 40 degrees today after a brutally cold weekend, so I decide to wear ankle-length pants. I like to live on the edge. 6:30 a.m. — Sip on my first cup of coffee and pack up my lunch for work. I have a really tasty breakfast that I hope will fill me up for a busy morning: TJ's multigrain bagel (half with butter and half with peanut butter) with two fried eggs, and a sliced pear. I also look over my weekend spending on Mint, something I do every morning, if not multiple times per day. I could probably ease up a little bit on this, but I stress out about money so much that tracking every penny of my spending gives me some peace of mind. 6:45 a.m. — I need to leave a few minutes early to fill my gas tank on the way to work. I live in D.C. but work in the suburbs of Virginia, so I have a pretty long commute. I just started listening to Jeffery Eugenides' new short story collection, so the drive isn't so bad today! $24.52 7:30 a.m. — Get settled at work and drink my second cup of coffee from a travel mug. My job is really stressful sometimes, but I mostly love it. We have a department meeting first thing and plan for our upcoming registration. It's good to catch up with my coworkers after a long weekend and get back in a routine. There are murmurs of a possible snow day tomorrow, but I'm not counting my chickens! 10:30 a.m. — I check on a student whose mental health I'm worried about, help another track down a spare textbook from a math teacher, and respond to parent emails. Then I meet with a new student and her dad to show her around the school and talk about the classes she will take. 12:45 p.m. — I was hungry for lunch about an hour ago, but I got sidetracked with students who needed to see me. Then I had to “walk” (read: escort) a student to in-school suspension. So goes the life of a school counselor! When I get back to my office, I see that my sweet coworker left me her soft pretzel; they come with school lunches but she didn't want hers and knows I love them. I eat that in approximately five seconds, then move on to the lunch I prepped yesterday while I read emails. 1:30 p.m. — I like something sweet in the afternoon, so I have a small apple and a piece of chocolate one of my students gave me for Christmas. I also make a cup of decaf coffee to sip on while I rush around to meetings this afternoon. 3:30 p.m. — Feeling so snacky today! I eat a little slice of leftover whole wheat banana bread and a few crackers with cheese. I always pack extra things like this in my lunchbox in case of a snack attack. 4:30 p.m. — I decide to run the few miles over to my ClassPass class tonight, which is a spin class at Flywheel. It's not too far and mostly downhill from my apartment — plus, parking is a nightmare near the studio. I tell myself I'll walk or take the bus home if I'm too pooped after class is over. 5:30 p.m. — Great spin class! I leave dripping in sweat, feeling strong and grateful for a body that is able to do lots of different things. 6:15 p.m. — Grab a free apple on the way out of the studio to sustain me for my walk home. My phone recently started to spontaneously die when the weather is cold, so I spend the quiet walk home making a to-do list in my head, thinking over the day, and wondering if we'll have a snow day tomorrow. 7 p.m. — Get home and start preparing vegetable pot pie for dinner! I'm using a recipe, so it's vegan — except I use regular pie crust, because pie crust must have butter in my humble opinion. I just put it in the oven to bake when my friend calls. We're both smart ladies who love trashy reality television, so we chat for a bit about the finale of on Bravo. She makes me laugh like crazy. 8 p.m. — Take a quick shower, put on PJs, and serve myself dinner. It is delicious! I finish the night off by taste testing some of the cereal milk ice cream from yesterday. Oh man, is it good. The buttery cereal crumble tears up the roof of my mouth a little bit, but that's a good problem to have, I think. 9:30 p.m. — Put on my retinol cream, take out my contacts, and hit the hay, hoping for a snow day tomorrow.

"5:30 a.m. — Wake up to a text that we have a two-hour delay. I'll take that! I set my alarm for 7 and go back to sleep. 7 a.m. — I'm awake. It felt so good to sleep in and still beat my alarm. I make a pot of coffee and a more time-intensive breakfast: a bowl of oatmeal with chia, flax, cinnamon, half a banana, and a scoop of peanut butter. I eat, drink my coffee, read blogs, and check my budget. I'm still waiting on a return credit for a pricey jacket I returned a week or two ago, but it's not in yet. Grr! I check my email and see that the store is trying to send me a store credit card instead of refunding the money to my credit card. Frustrated, I email customer service to see what they can do. I see that a Madewell order for a pair of jeans I was waitlisted for went through. (The hassle of needing tall sizes!) I got them for a great deal during a 30% off sale, though, so I didn't mind waiting. I update my budget spreadsheet with these purchases. $59.48 8 a.m. — Start getting ready for work. I have extra time and decide to put a few curls in my hair. Drink one more cup of coffee before leaving. 10 a.m. — Drop off my stuff in my office, then show my new student to all of her classes. Go to a meeting, see a few students, and prep for things happening next week. 12 p.m. — Eat lunch before I have to head down to cover the cafeteria. I eat the same things as yesterday plus an orange and carrots on the side. 1 p.m. — I have a meeting at our county office this afternoon, so I leave school. On my way I stop at one of my very favorite places: Wegmans! As a born and raised Rochesterian, this is a big deal for me, and definitely worth going out of my way through the Northern Virginia suburbs. I have plans to take myself to a movie tonight, which requires gummy candies and maybe chocolate. I pick and choose some favorites from the bulk section and also grab a twelve-pack of diet root beer, gum, a big bag of epsom salts, heavy cream, and malted milk powder to make more ice cream. Can't stop, won't stop. $20.61 2:30 p.m. — Leave the county office and head home. I have the whole afternoon ahead of me! In a flash of creativity, I start brainstorming my maid of honor speech for my best friend's wedding. It's not until the fall but great memories and ideas popped into my brain randomly this afternoon. I make a voice recording on my phone so I don't forget! 3:15 p.m. — Well, crap. Apparently Aritzia only gives store credit for returned sale items. I'm kicking myself for not checking the policy more carefully, and mad that I won't get the money back, which I wanted to put towards my larger than normal credit card bill this month. I guess it's good I have store credit, but I never even really shop here. Sigh. Lesson learned. 3:30 p.m. — Dust my apartment, Swiffer the floors, water my plant, fold laundry. I also pay a bill from my doctor's office. I thought I had a yeast infection last month (I didn't, thank goodness!) so my doctor ordered labs that insurance only partially covered. I try to have as many zero-spend days as possible in a month (which I'm doing a very bad job of this week). Since I've already spent money today, I figure I might as well check off this. $38.15 4:15 p.m. — Getting pretty hungry so I eat leftover roasted sweet potatoes and watch an episode of . Take a break to call my best friend and wish her luck on a job interview. I make a batch of malted vanilla ice cream and a pan of boxed brownies that I'm going to chop up and mix in. 5 p.m. — Early bird dinner: leftover cauliflower fried rice and kung pao chicken. 5:30 p.m. — I'm feeling a little cooped up and I decide to get fresh air and exercise by walking 35-ish minutes down to the Loft store to see what's new. I don't need to buy anything immediately but I am in the market for a new skirt or two, a pair of work pants, and a sweater. It's freezing out so I walk quickly and get my heart pumping! 6:30 p.m. — Struck out at Loft, which is a good thing for my budget. I decide it's too cold to walk to and from the movie theater like I planned. I'll have to see another time. I head home and swing by the library to pick up a few more holds that came in. 7:30 p.m. — When I get home, I churn up my ice cream, adding the brownie pieces and a caramel swirl, and stick it in containers in the freezer to share with friends and coworkers. Then I take a bath, eat some of the movie gummies I bought earlier, flip through cookbooks, and listen to a podcast. I text my brother about coming over to pick up ice cream tomorrow, text a bit with a few friends, and do a little browsing on OkCupid. 9:15 p.m. — In bed reading my book. An early night is great with me! I remind myself to make plans with friends over the weekend; it will feel good to be a little more social after an introverted week. Daily Total: $118.24",5,84
"5:45 a.m. — Up and starting my morning routine. I take my vitamin, put in my contacts, put on some serum and face oil, put some dry shampoo in my second day hair, and brush my teeth. Then I make coffee and pack my lunch. 6 a.m. — Do about 10 minutes of Duolingo practice while drinking coffee. I want to be more consistent with this habit — usually I'm great for about three weeks and then I totally stop. I'm visiting my brother in Paris in April, so that is motivation to practice my rusty high school French! I'm also trying to learn Spanish because a lot of the students and families I work with are from Latin America, so maybe I'll alternate which language I practice each day. I was taking a Spanish class but it got too expensive, so this will be a good free way to practice. 6:45 a.m. — Easy breakfast of two slices of whole wheat toast, one with peanut butter and one with butter, with a pear on the side. Get on the road to work a few minutes later than I was hoping to. 8 a.m. — Drink my second cup of coffee during my first meeting of the day. 11 a.m. — This morning has been crazy stressful. I'm trying to do ten things at once (see students, prep for registration, make schedule changes, plan a baby shower potluck for a coworker) and I feel like I'm not making progress on any of it. I'm already hungry at 11, so I eat an orange and crackers to tide me over until lunch, and keep plugging away. 12 p.m. — Lunch is leftover veggie pot pie with a spinach salad on the side. A little while after lunch, I eat a small apple and dark chocolate leftover from Christmas. I update my budget spreadsheet over lunch and read one of my favorite money-related websites, The Billfold. 5:15 p.m. — I have to meet with a student's parents and a teacher after school, which keeps me there way later than usual; it happens. My best friend asks if I can pick her up from campus on the way home. It's on my way and it's freezing out (she hates the cold!) so I tell her no problem. She stops at my apartment to pick up ice cream before heading home. 6 p.m. — I text a parent about tutoring her son and arrange to meet this Saturday. The extra money will be great! 6:30 p.m. — Go over to my friend's apartment for dinner. She feeds me leftover baked ziti and salad, which obviously tastes amazing because it wasn't made by me! We drink a beer and plan a potential summer program for rising high-school seniors. She's a great writing teacher and we think we could make money by doing a weeklong college application and essay bootcamp together. We brainstorm for a while and half-watch what might be the worst show ever made, . 8:30 p.m. — Walk home, take a shower, and start winding down. I taste test a little bit of the ice cream I made yesterday. It is so good, oh my goodness. New favorite flavor. I bring my laptop in bed to watch an episode of . I know better but every once in a while, I give in to the urge! Daily Total: $0",6,84
"5:45 a.m. — The usual morning routine commences. 6:15 a.m. — Pack up my lunch for today and make breakfast: multigrain toast, one with jam and one with butter, with two fried eggs and a few blackberries. And coffee, obviously. Check Mint, transfer my Venmo balance to my bank, and read blogs. 7:30 a.m. — Get to work a little early. Sip coffee in my travel mug and try to evaluate a few students' transcripts before a busy day of meetings. A sweet student gave me a Starbucks gift card yesterday for helping him with something, so I add that and a few others I had from Christmas to the app on my phone. Easier than juggling separate cards which very well could fall into the black hole that is my purse. Remind myself to write him a thank-you note later. 7:45 a.m. — Text with my friend who is considering getting bangs. I used to have super full bangs and loved them. Seeing the new trailer has made me want them again in a big way. The movies may be problematic, but damn, Anastasia Steele has good hair! I remember how annoying bangs can be, though, especially once you decide you no longer want them. What to do?! 12 p.m. — My coworkers and I actually are able to sit down for 20 minutes to eat lunch together. Miracle of miracles! I love chatting with them, but we're all so busy that it doesn't happen often. I have leftovers again and I'm looking forward to a new lunch next week. I eat quickly because I have to run to another meeting at 12:30. 1:45 p.m. — Snack on a few brownie pieces and an apple to power me through the rest of my afternoon meetings. 3:15 p.m. — So glad it's the weekend. I blast old school John Mayer on the drive home (embarrassing) and consider how I'd like to spend my evening. 4:30 p.m. — Change into workout clothes and go for a walk. It's beautiful out; the sun is setting and it's still in the low 50s. I stop by an ATM to deposit cash, then walk for 30 minutes or so. while chatting with my parents on the phone. This diary is making me realize how often I'm on the phone! I'm happy to stay connected with friends and family who live elsewhere but I know it's often a big distraction. 5:30 p.m. — Craving a huge salad for dinner,  I make one with romaine, spinach, pistachios, goat cheese, and dried cranberries. With some popcorn on the side for a whole grain. Yum! I start season two of . 7:30 p.m. — Finish the night with the rest of my gummies and chocolate, and a big glass of water. My brother comes over for ice cream and we chat for a while. He works a crazy consulting job so I don't get to see him often. He seems so old and mature to me! 9:30 p.m. — Wind down for the night, eager to finish my book. I'm feeling rested after a quiet couple of days, and I'm excited to have some more fun this weekend!

"12 p.m. — My husband and I both have today off, so we decide to go grocery shopping. Throughout my pregnancy, I didn't have any cravings. I pretty much ate the same and often times felt like eating and deciding what to eat was a chore. Now that i'm finally at 37 weeks, the snack cravings are intense and consistent. We first stop at Whole Foods, where I'm very disgruntled to not find pizzelle cookies anywhere since I'm specifically craving those. I am later torn about a $17 bag of pistachios. I really want them ... but not for $17! I wistfully circle the wine aisle for old time's sake and we finally go home with good ole weekly staples: salmon, steak, cereal, milk, broccoli, oranges, mandarins, roasted coffee beans, hummus, and a rotisserie chicken. I tell my husband that I am very disappointed about the $17 pistachios and lack of pizzelles and we decide to go to Trader Joe's to get our snack fix. $110 12:45 p.m. — Ah, Trader Joe's. How I love thee. Pre-pregnancy, I made a point of banning snacks in our house. Now that I'm on the last few weeks of my pregnancy, all bets are off. It's quite freeing to not worry about the state of my abs to be honest. I decide on chocolate covered pretzels, a box of thin almond butter cookies, and a bag of pistachios (more reasonably priced at $7); husband throws in a few bags of chips. $30 Daily Total: $140",1,85
"8:30 a.m. — About seven months into my pregnancy, I started taking Ubers to and from work. Months seven and eight, I was lucky enough to buy a monthly Uber pass for $15 that offers $5 off every Uber Pool. I live in the city and my workplace is a short highway ride away so I've been able to score rides for as low as $2. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to get one for this month, so no discount. I'm way too uncomfortable to take public transportation to work and the truth of the matter is everyone is too absorbed in their cell phones to ever give up their seat for me. I count my daily Uber rides as a necessary health and mental pregnancy expense. $6.75 6 p.m. — My UberPool home tonight was interesting. As I got out of the car, the other rider asked if I live in ""that house."" When I said yes, he replied that he lived there about three years ago. I wanted to stop and talk but was already halfway out of the car. When I get inside, I tell my husband that I think I shared an Uber with an old tenant of ours. My husband and I own a two-family house and we rent out the second floor to tenants to help us with our $4,000 mortgage. (Technically our mortgage is $3,800 but we refinanced it to a 20-year one and pay an extra $225 every month in the hopes paying it off sooner.) I remember the Uber driver confirming the other rider's name when he got in, and my husband and I remember who he is at the same time. He worked for a luxury company, partied all the time, and made a hole in the kitchen wall. We hated him. $7.50 Daily Total: $14.25",2,85
"12:30 p.m. — I get to work from home today as I have a doctor's appointment; my OB is now doing a pelvis exam at every visit to see how dilated I am. Last week's exam was extremely uncomfortable but quick. When she reached up to feel my cervix, however, I make a noise —not quite a scream but it definitely in the realm of ""Argh!"" She pulls out earlier than she wants and tells me that next week she'll try to position me better to really feel for it. She also says she thinks I'm about one centimeter dilated. which isn't a lot but I'm glad. I don't want the baby to come any earlier! I pay $6 for parking and then go home to work a bit. My snacking is intense today: I polish off the bag of pistachios and half the box of almond butter cookies. I finally put away the latter when I realize I'm feeling a bit sick. Apparently you can eat too much of a good thing. $6 5 p.m. — I realize I am running out of Bio-Oil and order more on Amazon Prime. I don't know how effective Bio-Oil really is in preventing stretch marks but I am not taking any chances. I rub oil on my belly every morning and night and go through one a bottle every one and a half months or so. No stretch marks (that I can see at least). $13 Daily Total: $19",3,85
"9:15 a.m. — I decided to work from home today again. It's nice to pull the ""I'm pregnant"" card. I make oatmeal with an egg swirled in and sweeten it with coconut sugar. I usually eat cereal with milk but since I have access to my kitchen, I'm being a little more decadent. After eating half a box of almond butter cookies last night, my craving for it has completely disappeared, but I do want something to snack on. I decide to bake seasoned sweet potato fries. 2:30 p.m. — Husband and I have been very lucky to have incredibly generous family and friends who gave us a lot of presents and great hand-me-down for my baby shower. As a result, we haven't needed to buy the baby anything other two Ikea drawers to put in the nursery. The one thing we do want to splurge on is a baby stroller. When I first found out about the world of expensive baby strollers from a friend, I scoffed and said, ""Not me! I would never spend that much!"" Egg. On. My. Face. After much research, we decided to go with Uppababy Vista because you can put as many as three kids in the same carriage. We both know we want more than one child and we figure we are saving money in the long run buying one stroller instead of multiple. (That's what we tell ourselves anyway.) We finally buy it with a 20% coupon. $725 6:30 p.m. — For dinner we make miso salmon with a brown rice-quinoa medley. We try to eat dinner at home on the weekdays to save money. (Very important since we're buying $700 strollers around here!) Daily Total: $725",4,85
"8:45 a.m. — Daily UberPool into work today — the last day of work before I go on maternity leave. I get two weeks off before my due date, which is a very nice perk. I plan to use that time to mentally prepare myself for the baby. I'm fully aware that I am on the cusp of a life-changing event but sometimes I think I'm a bit in denial. I know I'm only weeks away from my due date but I feel like I haven't really processed it yet. I ponder over this during my ride to work. $7.50 12 p.m. — Lunch is rotisserie chicken and hummus from home. It's easy, fast, and cheap and pretty much what I get every week when I grocery shop. (Even though I feel like every rotisserie chicken from my Whole Foods is typically scorched and burned on the outside. Every single time!) 5:30 p.m. — Splurge on Uber but I don't care. It's my last ride home from work for awhile! It feels bittersweet ... not. It just feels sweet. I am so excited to not work for two weeks before my due date. $14.50 8:30 p.m. — It's Fri-yay which means husband and I are going out to eat for dinner.We decide to go to our neighborhood Japanese restaurant that does izakaya. We are so lucky to have a great variety of Asian food where we live, and we go to this restaurant so often that the waitstaff knows us. Unfortunately, we don't know them enough that we get to waltz in and cut the line when it's crowded, but they do grace us with head nods and waves. We always go HAM when we order here. Today, we get our usual staples of ramen, fried oysters, cod roe pasta, sushi (for the husband), fries with roe sauce, Japanese steak, and Omusoba. We always over-order and leave the restaurant hating ourselves a tad. $105 Daily Total: $127",5,85
"10 a.m. — Husband goes to gym and comes home with a breakfast sandwich for me to eat. There's a local, no-frills, mom-and-pop shop that makes a wonderful bread/croissant hybrid. I really think this pastry could be the next cronut if they were media or marketing savvy. It changes the breakfast sandwich game! $8 5:30 p.m. — We are going to a friend's potluck and pop on over to Whole Foods to buy a chicken pot pie. We also pick up beer at the local liquor store. I've taken to drinking O'Douls, a non-alcoholic beer, in social situations. I don't even like beer, but when you are pregnant and can't drink, O'Douls is a life saver. It's what I treat myself to every weekend. $30 Daily Total: $38",6,85
"11 a.m. — We meet up with family for dim sum. It might be sacrilegious to say but I never loved loved dim sum pre-pregnancy. Now that I'm pregnant, I love it. We drive to another town for a restaurant known for their buns. They're made in-house and are divine: the top is sweet and crusty and inside of the bun is melted, egg yolk goodness. To be honest, I'm not sure this is something I should be eating while pregnant (because of the yolk) but I prefer to stay blissfully ignorant and enjoy it. Husband and I pay the bill. $85 4:30 p.m. — I go online and search for matching holiday PJs for the family, looking for the long johns-style or onesies in particular — the cheesier, the better. The search proves harder than I thought. I'm particular about the print and don't want anything too pricey as these will probably only be worn once a year during Christmas. I search online for a set of four, for my husband, myself, the dog, and the baby. I finally decide to take a chance and buy a set on eBay from China. The sizing and quality could be off but it's cheap and who doesn't love ? I am giddy with excitement when I make the purchase. There was no matching set for the dog but my husband assures me our dog can wear a costume instead. This is why I married him! $45 7:30 p.m. — Husband and I decided get take-out from the local shawarma place. I get a beef gyro with rice and husband gets a chicken gyro with rice. What completes the dish is the garlic sauce they drizzle over it. Husband knows I love pistachio and sweets and surprises me with baklava! $33 Daily Total: $163",7,85

All of my family lives in the Lower 48, but I have breakfast plans with one of the guys I'm dating, Q. ​9:05 a.m. — ​I run to Starbucks get two coffees and a chocolate croissant. I use my rewards for one of the coffees and the other two cost $6.80 on my gold card. I munch on the sickly sweet croissant and regret getting it.

After I feed the dog and leave her a variety of Christmas treats, I head to Walgreens to pick up a few things for my friend's parents, who are hosting.

My friend's family is Alaska Native (Yupik) and I live for the chance to eat traditional, native Alaskan food. I hang out for a while after dinner and then head home with fry bread to-go, thanking them for the feast. 7:45 p.m. — At home eating fry bread, watching trash reality TV, and looking up recipes for homemade Lush products.

I keep telling myself to stop buying sous vide bites because they're outrageously expensive, but they taste so good and I'm weak. $25 ​8:14 a.m. — ​Get to the office later than usual (thanks to my snooze) but I'm still not ""late."" I catch up on a few progress notes from the week before, answer emails, and prepare for the day ahead. I have more scheduled than I realized. ​10:07 a.m. — ​My 10 o'clock appointment doesn't show up so I Google how to report missing packages. A big Christmas present this year from my mom was stolen in the mail, which happens a lot in my neighborhood.  I'm pretty bummed, not only for the gift itself (an Apple Watch, which would be really helpful at work) but also because my mom and I have had a strained relationship in the past and her sending me a gift was a big gesture. This city is getting more and more dangerous every year; crime is up and theft is out of control. It breaks my heart that people are so selfish and desperate. ​11 a.m. — ​Run home super quick and let my dog out for before meeting an out-of-town friend for lunch. Check to see if my mom's package showed up on the off chance that it wasn't stolen, but no luck. Meet my friend at a cute Mexican place by my work.

When I get home, I call my bank regarding an ongoing issue with a card I paid off seven (!) years ago that is still causing problems. After, I play with the dog and eat a few chocolates. I text a friend to see if she wants to go to the gym but she's busy. Feeling lonely, I also text my ex. I'm not smart. ​6:40 p.m. — ​Just spent 75 minutes on the phone with one of the guys I'm seeing, M. I'm not dating seriously because I recently got out of a long-term relationship, but we had a nice chat. I sit on the couch and strongly consider buying a makeup palette I've had my eye on, but the cozy blanket and not wanting to spend money make me hold off. ​7:30 p.m. — ​Despite the fact that it's seven degrees out, I drag my ass out of the house and go to the mall, agonizing over wasting money on what is essentially sparkly powder. I get there and, holy shit, it's Lush's once-a-year sale! Of course, I have to get some soap. The scents to die for and I support the company's ethics (especially at half-off). I know this stuff will last me months and having beautifully scented soaps in the morning makes getting out of bed more bearable. $31.85 ​8:05 p.m. — ​Arrive at Sephora. I use my grandma's Christmas gift to me ($50) to get a Naked palette and another palette that's on sale. I almost spent $100 but then I put something back and ""only"" spent less than $70. $68.40 ​8:55 p.m. — ​On the drive home, I strongly resist the urge to be lazy and buy fast food. I'm a junk food addict — not even exaggerating. I meet the DSM criteria for junk food addiction and it is literally a struggle to not eat out. I pull into the parking lot of a fast food place and then make a quick U-turn before I can think twice about wasting more money today. I drive home and make myself sesame garlic beef and cabbage tacos. I put the leftovers in a glass container for tomorrow and go to bed. ​11 p.m. — ​I round out my day of irresponsible spending by ordering Stila eyeshadow I didn't get at Sephora. I have a $5 off coupon on Amazon, so I get a discount on that and a Rebel Alliance Star Wars vinyl decal ($1.50) for my car. $21.50 Daily Total: $179.72",2,86
"​7 a.m. — ​Wake up, shower, let the dog out, grab my leftovers from yesterday, and defrost my car. It's ridiculously cold this time of year, but at least we're past the winter solstice and I can tell myself that we're gaining daylight! I don't fully realize how cold it was until I get to my job and my coworker says it's minus two degrees. ​7:45 a.m. — ​Get to Starbucks and order my usual Americano and egg bites. (I know, I know.) I also impulsively buy a package of madeleines and gum, and everything goes on my Starbucks card. When I'm eating well, I'm a fucking champion; when I'm off the wagon, so to speak, my spending and eating both suffer. I vow to get back on track ASAP. ​8 a.m. — ​Get to work and groggily start my day. ​11:15 a.m. — I make a cup of coffee from our staff kitchenette; it's free and warm, two of my favorite things. In my downtime, I look into credit cards with rewards. I have one credit card that I've been managing well and I've improved my credit score over the past few years; it's up almost 300 points! But I recently applied for a credit card with Wells Fargo and was rejected. I used to be a financial idiot, but I've learned a lot (thank you, r/personalfinance!). Still, I'm being penalized for an account with them I paid off seven years ago. Lo and behold, Discover approves for a different card with a $9,500 limit and better rewards. ​12:30 p.m. — ​Head home for lunch and obsessively check my mail again. I know my gift is stolen but I'm still hopeful. I let the dog out, eat my leftovers, and do some dishes before I go back to work. ​1:15 p.m. — ​I feel a headache coming on and chug a Nalgene bottle of water and take some of my coworker's Tylenol. I host a pub quiz as one of my three side hustles and ask if anyone can cover for me tonight. Everyone is busy so I suck it up and follow through with my responsibilities. My friends are seeing the Christmas special at a theater pub and I wanted to go. Before getting back to work, I order 30-month credit score monitoring pass for $4.99. I like checking my score every day even though it almost never changes. $4.99 ​4:40 p.m. — Go to Kinkos and print out the quiz materials ($2.60), then chill at home with my roommates and the dogs, discussing and how shitty men are. $2.60 ​6:40 p.m. — ​Get to the quiz early to set up but the sound guy isn't here, so I order fondu and awkwardly wait around until he shows up. ​8:45 p.m. — Quiz ends. For hosting, I get $50 and a $25 bar tab which isn't bad for three hours of (usually) fun work. I spent $3 on garage parking because I couldn't find street parking near the venue and wasn't about to walk several blocks in negative-degree temperatures! $3 9 p.m. — ​I get home and talk to my roommate for a while before he goes to bed. A fellow stand-up comedian in town asks me to debate him during a holiday special, but I tell him no because I'd need more time to prepare. He says he understands — he's asking a day before the show.

"​6:55 a.m. — ​Wake up, shower, take care of the dog, get ready. I didn't manage my time well and have to dry the clothes I'm wearing this morning. It works out and my clothes are only damp. Yay, adulting! ​7:40 a.m. — ​Stop by Starbucks and get my usual Americano and egg bites, paying with the gold card. ​8:05 a.m. — ​At work and in for another busy day. ​10:45 a.m. — ​Take my lunch and head home to play with the dog and reheat my food. I'm low on food and need to go to the grocery store soon. I pay some bills and text my roommates for their portions since they're both still asleep. After, I check the mail; still no Christmas gift. I really wish I wasn't still holding out hope; it sucks. 11:30 a.m. — ​Get back to work for back-to-back group and individual sessions with my clients. The holidays have made things a little hectic. During a quick break in my schedule, I place a mobile order for groceries at Fred Meyer. I'm excited to make low-carb burrito bowls! I order heavy cream, jalapeños, low-carb tortillas, cheese, garlic, guacamole, taco seasoning, diced tomatoes and green chiles, frozen chicken, salsa, sour cream, bell peppers, green onions, cabbage, beef steak tips, sesame oil, pickles, zucchini, and coconut butter. Food in Alaska is so expensive and the quality is tenuous, but it's still cheaper than eating out all the time. $83.88 ​4:30 p.m. — ​I head home after a busy afternoon. I'm going to a planning meeting for the upcoming DSA Women's March, then hang out with one of the guys I'm seeing, C. But as I'm preparing dinner, my roommate collapses into a grand mal seizure. My roommate is epileptic and manages his seizures through medication; this is his first seizure in a long time and it is extremely scary. ​5:15 p.m. — ​I call the paramedics as soon as his seizure starts, and for some reason, they send over 11 EMTs. He eventually comes to, slowly, but refuses to go to the emergency room because he can't afford it. It is so fucking frustrating that people are turning down necessary, potentially life-saving medical care because they can't afford to rack up $1,500 on top of already extensive medical debt. I understand his decision, but I strongly urge him to let me take him to the ER like the paramedic advises. He says no, and I respect it. ​6:15 p.m. — ​My roommate's sibling shows up, and I leave for a few minutes to pick up my Fred Meyer order. Back home, I start cooking again. In the Instant Pot, I make a combination of chicken breast, ranch dip, cream cheese, and cheddar. While that's cooking, I bake bacon to crumble in it later. I also make chicken fajita bowls for work with seasoning, peppers, garlic, onion, and tomato and put that into individual glass containers. I periodically check on my roommate who is wiped out from his seizure. 10:30 p.m. — My roommate wakes up and I serve him some dinner. Seeing what a seizure looks like gives me a lot of empathy for what he's gone through his whole life, and I see him in a new light. Seizures are fucking scary and he's incredibly brave. We process what happened and then go to bed. Daily Total: $83.88",4,86
"​7:00 a.m. — ​Wake up, shower, take care of the dog, add salsa and sour cream to a burrito bowl. 7:45 a.m. — ​Go to Starbucks and get my Americano — but no egg bites! I realize my Starbucks card is getting low so I refill it. $25 ​8:05 a.m. — ​Work as usual. Lots of paperwork, and I'm more than ready to start my last three-day weekend for a while. 11:30 a.m. — ​Take lunch to go check on my roommate and let out the dogs. I check the mail (nothing) and go back to work, fighting the urge to get more coffee. I didn't sleep well and I feel sluggish and unmotivated, despite all the work I definitely need to do. ​4:21 p.m. — My day at work was hectic. It wasn't horrible because I absolutely love my job and the clients I serve, but it ended on a sour note. I have a strong urge to eat my feelings. In the past, I would drive to my favorite chicken wing place and spend, no joke, $25 on wings. I'd do that several times a week; it was out of control. I couldn't afford it either, but somehow I spent the money anyway. I'm super tempted to start the habit again but I stay strong. I see that the Naked Smokey Eye palette is on NordstromRack.com for $25 before shipping, and I definitely buy it. I tell myself it's my reward for dealing with my day and not binge-eating shitty food. I started wearing makeup very recently, and I really like the confidence boost it gives me. $31 ​5:30 p.m. — ​I go home and play with the dog. My roommate asks for a ride to the bank and I agree. Because of his seizure, he can't legally drive for six months and I offered to help him out as much as I can. While I wait for him, I get a drip coffee, paying on my Starbucks card. 7:30 p.m. — ​I meet friends at a comedy show. I'm taking a break from performing for a while but I still like to go and support friends, plus it's always fun. I get a turkey bacon and avocado sandwich, pickle chips, and a drink. $30 12:30 a.m. — ​After the show, we all hang out for a while, talking and taking cheesy polaroid pictures. I don't drink much so I offer to take two of my friends home. They ask me to stop at Taco Bell (obviously) so I do (obviously). I get a burrito and a Diet Pepsi, but my friend offers to pay. 1:30 a.m. — I get home and chat with my roommate for a bit before heading to bed. Daily Total: $86",5,86
"10:30 a.m. — ​I wake up with no alarm. I love these kinds of days. My roommates and I have a cleaning date scheduled; our house has gotten messy so we agree to do a purge together. I want to get coffee and my roommate needs a ride to get his dog's medicine. I order coffee and two yogurts ($3.86 on my Starbucks card). We return home and deep clean, getting a bunch of stuff loaded up for donations. ​4:30 p.m. — ​I decide to take a nap before my date tonight. Z. and I planned a winter hike on Flattop. Even though I'm doubtful it's accessible at this time of year, I'm down to try it out. I wake up to get ready and go downstairs, only to see that my dog rifled through some of the stuff we planned to take — including two pieces of dark chocolate I bought in Scotland a few months ago. Fuck. I call the vet and they say to bring her in. ​8 p.m. — ​Cancel my date with Z. and rush the dog to the vet. I'm so angry at myself for leaving it in her reach but grateful I saw the packaging before it was too late. I get to the vet and they check her in, get her vitals, and induce vomiting. Z. comes over and sits with me for a little bit. The dog is fine in the end; they check her stomach and don't find any of the chocolate so it's possible I may have overreacted, but honestly, I'd rather be safe than sorry — and this is the entire reason I have a savings account. The visit costs more than $200. I pay gladly because my dog is worth it. $225 9:30 p.m. — ​Stop by Walgreens to get popcorn and chips. So much for eating healthy; what a fucking week. $6.56 ​10 p.m. — ​Get home and watch , snuggling and monitoring the dog until way too late. Someone texts me and I realize that it's 1:40 in the morning, so I go to bed. Daily Total: $231.56",6,86
"8 a.m. — ​Wake up and fall back asleep. It's too early. 11 a.m. — ​Get out of bed and shower. I agreed to show my Roomba to a woman from Facebook marketplace. The Roomba is cool and I wanted one for a long time, but I almost never use it (and it scares my dog) so I've decided to sell it. 12 p.m. — ​The potential buyer comes over, checks out the Roomba, and decides she wants it. She gives me $100 in cash and I tell her that if it gives her any problems, she should return it and I'll give her a refund. She says it should be fine though. 12:30 p.m. — ​I run and grab coffee, paying with my Starbucks card. 2:20 p.m. — ​My roommate and I go see at a local theater pub. I order a steak burrito, breadsticks, and a drink. My roommate forgot her card so she uses mine and pays me back on Venmo. $29 (including tip) 4:30 p.m. — ​After the movie, I go home and take a nap. I love naps. I have plans with friends for New Years, but I'm not doing anything until I sleep for an hour. 6 p.m. — ​Wake up, shower, get dressed. I stop by the store and buy Champagne, gum, and an iced coffee. $26.93 7:30 p.m. — ​Pick up my friend and head to our other friend's party. It ends up being an extremely fun and goofy time, and I spend most of the night there, feeling grateful for good friends and excited about the new year. Daily Total: $55.93",7,86
"9:30 a.m. — I wake up around 9 after dancing the night away. BF, friend and I stayed at a retreat center this past weekend for a New Years party. We grab some of the treats — potatoes, shakshuka, fruit salad, and a sweet orange cardamom pastry. I pass on coffee. 12:30 p.m. — We thought we were full from breakfast but end up at a brewery on the way back. I can't pass up a chance for Pliny on tap. We sign up for a table and there are a few other groups ahead of us. To pass time, we walk across the street and check out a bookstore. I start my New Years resolution of reading more books and buy by Murakami, and , a mystery with a fun cover. $33 1:30 p.m. — My friend buys lunch for everyone since BF drove. I've been craving a tuna sandwich all weekend and finally get one, along with the aforementioned Pliny! Friend gets a sampler and BF gets a dark beer; both of them order pizza. After, we head out to finish the bulk of our drive back home. 9 p.m. — We stop by an Indian place where my boyfriend buys dinner; we split chicken biryani and naan. Half of my tuna sandwich is left over from lunch but I need groceries anyway, so we stop at Sprouts and I get a bundle of spinach, almond milk, veggie straws, potato chips, a rotisserie chicken, pecans, and a bag salad kit. I am a bit nervous about going back to work after the holidays because I know things will ramp up quickly. I am hoping the snacks can help me destress. $23 Daily Total: $56",1,87
"7:30 a.m. — First day of work after the holidays. I usually wake up at 7:30 and take a five to 10-minute shower, making it to my desk around 8:30. I have to work on a paper and submit it this week but it has been difficult to focus. I tried to work on it during holidays, but failed and now I am running out of time. I grab soda water from the café. We get free drinks (soda, coffee, and tea). None of it is fancy but it does the trick. 11 a.m. — I eat my leftover tuna sandwich (though the potato chips in it didn't keep well) along with the salad kit. Still procrastinating on the paper, I look up a mead tour that my friends want to go on. I buy a Groupon for BF and myself; the original price is $70 for two tastings and a tour. After coordinating with friends, I schedule us to go on the same date a few weekends from now. $27 3 p.m. — I beat my 3 o'clock slump eating a dark chocolate bar with cherries and almonds. My friend bought it for my birthday and I enjoying it, wishing there were more cherries. 6 p.m. — I meet a friend for dinner at a new restaurant similar to Panda Express. In the end, neither of us is impressed and I don't love the quality of the meat. We talk about holidays, boys, and future plans. When I met her a few months ago, we bonded over our mutual love of hiking. She got injured later on so we mostly meet for drinks or food now. $9.50 7:45 — I fill up my tank and purchase a car wash, passing on tri-foam and going for the mid-grade option. I have to go inside to make the purchase and end up buying mini-donuts. $44 Daily Total: $80.50",2,87
"4 a.m. — I wake up way too early and don't fall asleep again until 6. When my alarm finally goes off again at 7:30, I hit snooze until I am forced to get out of bed at 7:40. I get into the office at 9 and grab a banana and coffee before my meeting. I eat three of the mini-donuts I bought last night. 12 p.m. — Before lunch, I work on more emails, my paper, and type up notes. Lunch today consists of chicken and spinach and an Arnold Palmer from the café. I also send a friend a message to cancel our climbing date since I am too tired. 5:30 p.m. — I head home, clean the bathroom, and tiredly make a bootleg risotto using packets of parmesan and turkey burger meat after I eat a quick snack of cereal. I also make a mocktail; I love mixing different drinks together. 9 p.m. — Talk to BF on the phone and then pass out. Daily Total: $0",3,87
"3 a.m. — I wake up because of an earthquake! BF and I chat online for a bit until I finally pass out around 5. I am a light sleeper and I have not been sleeping well this week. I wake up again at 7:30, and dial into my 8 a.m. meeting from home. Finally make it to the office by 9 for another meeting and manage to grab a banana and coffee before it starts. After that, I focus on my paper. 12:30 p.m. — Lunch is chicken and spinach again, and I'm not tired of it yet. At 2, I snack on the potato chips and veg straws I bought. I can feel the paper deadline creeping closer and am a bit stressed. That, and the lack of sleep, are not good for me. 4:50 p.m. — Meet my friend at the gym, which is primarily for climbing but also has fitness classes. I do a few routes that I haven't completed before, and leave feeling good. 8 p.m. — I meet my parents and brothers for dinner. My brother is going back to college for the spring semester and is vegetarian, so we meet at a vegan Chinese restaurant. I love all the dishes, especially the fake ham. My parents pay. 9:30 p.m. — I get home after talking to BF on the drive home. At home, I browse the internet, reading about various gums. I'm looking for a brand I heard about that has a calcium supplement. It has been phased out but is still being sold on Amazon, so I purchase a few packs. Head to bed early, exhausted. $20 Daily Total: $20",4,87
"5 a.m. — Wake up early again and can't fall back asleep this time. I am getting really tired of this. I get into work at 9 and buy a banana and coffee from the café. I snack throughout the morning on that and mini-donuts while I finish the paper. 11:45 a.m. — The same lunch as yesterday with potato chips. My company offers a snack on Friday afternoons, and today's is hot chocolate with a few toppings, including sprinkles and regular and vegan marshmallows. I grab a cup and almost die of a sugar rush. 4 p.m. — It's a friend's birthday and we meet for happy hour drinks at a bar and restaurant. I order a tofu rice bowl that ends up being incredibly spicy, and my BF texts to say he'll meet us later. We hang out for a bit and then go to another bar across the street. For some reason, I am craving mashed potatoes but they only have cauliflower. I purchase a side of that for a few bucks and order a blended piña colada with blue curaçao. My BF meets us at the second restaurant and orders beer and fries. I pay and we leave at around 10:30 because I need sleep. $30 Daily Total: $30",5,87
"10 a.m. — BF and I are doing a wine tasting trip today. We wake up and grab donuts first; the donut holes I ordered are slightly dry, but the sprinkled one is better. We get a large coffee to share that's too hot to drink. $5 11:45 a.m. — We find a place to eat lunch on Yelp and decide to try it out. We split a sandwich and BF pays. 3 p.m. — We finally make it to the first winery; the wine is amazing and BF buys a bottle of Sangiovese. I don't know that much about wine but I usually prefer whites. We go across the street next, which ends up being crazy since everyone is already drunk. They show us a long list of all the tasters they give out for free and we get excited. I get a bit buzzed and purchase honey chipotle almonds that spill all over the counter when I try to open the bag. Yep, I am drunk. BF drives us to the hot springs. $6 4:30 p.m. — We go to watch the sun set at the hot springs. They're nice but the view isn't the best since it is winter and the grape fields are barren. I also end up destroying a silver necklace wearing it in the water! BF pays and also gets us a bottle of champagne to share. 6:30 p.m. — I am craving Thai, so we find a place neither of us has tried on Yelp. I order pad Thai and BF orders mango curry. I also get us spring rolls. We had a fun day, but it's time to drive back. $40 8:30 p.m. — BF is still driving and he needs a Red Bull. I fill up the gas tank while he also buys Reese's Peanut Butter Cups. We eat a lot and contemplate getting boba, but decide we aren't craving it enough. Finally back at home, we hang out for a bit until we go to bed around 11. $35 Daily Total: $86",6,87
"10 a.m. — After eating leftover Thai food, we go to Target to get coffee at the Starbucks inside. We want to hike today and coffee is always awesome before a hike. The park is only 20 minutes away from my house and the hike is relatively short — five miles, mostly flat. 3 p.m. — We go to the jewelry store so I can drop off my necklace to be fixed and pick up popcorn chicken and boba across the street. 5 p.m. — Head to my friend's house because she wants to show us a few new anime shows. We linger and watch anime until 8 or so. BF still needs to drive back home and he lives an hour away. After he leaves, I watch Netflix back at home and then pass out around 11. Daily Total: $0",7,87
"8:30 a.m. — I wake up being 100% cuddled by our three dogs and feeling so rested. My husband makes coffee and sits down to play video games. I make a latte and sit around lazily until the last possible minute to get ready for church. 12 p.m. — We are home again and both ravenous. Fortunately, we have leftover chicken and potatoes so it's a quick reheat. 5 p.m. — We head to the grocery store. We usually do one big trip per week on the weekends and since I cook six nights per week, there's a lot to get. We both had gym memberships before we were married but we've canceled them to cut back on spending, so my husband runs back home from the store for exercise. $100.22 6:30 p.m. — Every Friday night, we eat Chinese food and rent a movie. We had friends over Friday, so our tradition got pushed to Sunday. My favorite place is closed on Sundays but trying something new was a nice change. $22.54 9 p.m. — We're planning a trip to London next year and have a budget discussion. My mom and I are big into earning credit card reward points for travel, so my husband and I weigh the pros and cons of signing up for two new cards for their free hotel stay sign-on bonuses. We already have two out of six nights taken care of and conclude that tomorrow, I'll sign us up for one more credit card and we'll book a home vacation rental for three nights. 10:30 p.m. — We've been addicted to a game on our phones for about six months now and occasionally make in-app purchases. My husband is the culprit this time. We play a bit before heading to bed. $3.40 Daily Total: $126.16",1,88
"7:50 a.m. — My husband rolls out of bed to take the dogs out and water the lawn. He usually leaves work earlier than I do so he takes the first dog-walking shift while our newly-seeded lawn tries to sprout. 9:30 a.m. — I arrive at work half an hour after my husband. We work for the same company and it's a 45-second walk to each other's office. 11 a.m. — I sign us up for our new credit card and make the first payment on our vacation rental. It will end up costing us about $360 but the rest isn't due for more than a month. As much as I'd love to have a luxurious vacation stay, we decide on a budget-friendly but stylish studio in the city. $162.84 12 p.m. — My husband doesn't eat breakfast and usually just eats an apple for lunch. I don't know how he does it. I heat up leftover Chinese food from last night and offer him a few of my dumplings to supplement his fruit. 1 p.m. — My husband will be out of town next week so I'm trying to think of things to do without him. After scouring upcoming local events on Facebook, I decide to try a watercolor class next Wednesday. I already have some off-brand paints, so I message the instructor to make sure I won't be banished for not buying the recommended materials. That would be a deal-breaker for me. $15 3:45 p.m. — We moved from a big city last year where my commute was an hour in traffic each way and now I relish my 10-minute commute. I stop at the gas station on the way home because I don't think my car will start again if I don't. Our grocery store gives away gas coupons based on how much you spend that trip. Today, I'm saving $0.10 per gallon. $24.30 4:15 p.m. — I walk all of the dogs before my sister FaceTimes me. Every time she calls, I get motivated to clean while we talk. 5:30 p.m. — I make two portions of an Asian salad, eat one, and save the other for my husband, who has been coaching toddler soccer for a couple of months. We love Asian salads but this new recipe is mediocre. I'll delete it from my Pinterest board later. 7:30 p.m. — My husband is home and we are off to try a new swing dance class. I've wanted to get into it for a while and he's been a good sport. We tried learning from online videos a few months ago, but couldn't find a free option that didn't leave us completely overwhelmed. I've been keeping an eye on the swing dance community in the big city closest to us and they are offering a free introductory class tonight. We'll dance the night away there! 9 p.m. — Not quite what we expected. There were a TON of people because it was free, and it was organized so that I never got to dance with my favorite dance partner — my husband! After this class, we'd have to pay for the classes for the rest of the month and I don't think it's worth it. We stop at a grocery store on the way home because I'm on the hunt for hazelnuts. They don't have any but my husband suggested we buy cake for dessert ($5.45) and I stock up on dish sponges ($13.21) that are cheaper here than at our regular store. $18.66 Daily Total: $220.80",2,88
"8:55 a.m. — I really wanted to hit a coffee shop this morning for a latte but my budget conscience is getting the best of me. We have a latte machine anyway and I'm running on time for once, so I make one for my husband and myself. 1 p.m. — It's been a busy day but my husband and I planned a lunch date. He has a punch card for “free noodles for a year” at Noodles & Co. (It's really just buy one bowl, get one free once a month for a year, so we go once a month.) We usually do their online surveys for a free appetizer each time we go but I forgot this time; we order the pot stickers anyway ($9.45). He drove so he fills up on gas ($40.83) and picks up a video game he had preordered ($52.33) while we're out. $102.61 3:30 p.m. — I head home, but not before realizing that we got a small foreign transaction fee when we booked the vacation rental. I make a mental note to look into foreign transaction fees and how I can avoid them while abroad. $4.88 5:30 p.m. — My husband is coaching soccer again so I settle in for a few hours of . I don't usually have the attention span to binge-watch shows, but I can't get enough of Rory's love life. 7:15 p.m. — My husband is home and showered just in time for me to finish making turkey burger patty melts with fries. I freeze enough turkey burger meat to make one more for myself when he's out of town next week. 10:30 p.m. — My husband plays video games while I read my library book for a few hours. I make us tea and heat up pumpkin cookies I stored in the freezer last week before we go to bed. Daily Total: $107.49",3,88

I scarf down the last of the leftover chicken and potatoes (I follow the one-week rule for leftovers and it hasn't failed me yet) before my boss calls me back into his office to type a few emails. 1 p.m. — My husband pops into my office, excitedly about our favorite author's newest book release. We don't seem to share the same feelings about libraries. $15.89 4 p.m. — After the hectic day I just had, a trip to the dentist's office is actually relaxing. I get an exceptionally chatty hygienist, which makes the cleaning go faster. This is the first year I've had dental insurance in awhile and I'm really glad I do. $21.80 5:30 p.m. — We're both starving so I get our Mediterranean chicken and veggies going. It's an easy meal to make and I watch while it cooks. My husband goes out for a run — he is way more disciplined than I am. 7 p.m. — After eating and watching a show with our free Hulu trial, I suggest we use a coupon that came in the mail to get milkshakes. $4.76 10:30 p.m. — We both spend the evening reading before hitting the lights. Tomorrow is going to be a long day. Daily Total: $48.02",4,88
7:45 a.m. — I leave a little earlier on Thursdays and Fridays so I take the dogs out and get an egg and toast going. 9 a.m. — I am amazingly bad at getting up early enough to fully get ready. I literally ran out the door to get to work on time and I settle in for a lot of paperwork. 12:30 p.m. — I pull out my leftover Noodles & Co. for lunch. I am an expert at making single servings last several meals. 1 p.m. — My husband was traveling for work for the day and spotted a Chipotle. He gets lunches reimbursed when he travels so it was on the house! ($9.69 expensed) 6 p.m. — Husband and I settle in to eat spaghetti and watch YouTube videos. We spend a little too long afterward being lazy. 7:10 p.m. — I failed to get off the couch in time to get ready so I'm flying around last minute figuring out what to wear. We're watching my brother-in-law play a concert about 30 miles away. My in-laws are very generous about paying for us when we're out and they covered our tickets. 11 p.m. — Our backs are killing us and I'm glad to be sitting in the car again. Our post-concert tradition is always getting fast food on the way home; my chicken sandwich hits the spot. $7.39 Daily Total: $7.39,5,88
"9 a.m. — I thought I was going to be late but miraculously, I hit my desk right at 9, homemade latte in hand. 12 p.m. — I always try to hold off for lunch until noon or later, so I reheat my meager portion of Mediterranean chicken and veggies and glance at the newspaper. We considered getting newspaper delivery to our house but borrowing them from work (and stealing the crossword section at the end of the day) is much cheaper. 1 p.m. — My husband noticed that one of our sprinklers broke this morning so he went to Menards to get lawn watering paraphernalia. $39.41 5:30 p.m. — I meet my husband at home and we start our Friday night movie and Chinese food ritual. $22.95 8 p.m. — We have tea and pumpkin cookies while my husband plays video games and I read. I also make our bi-weekly donation to our old church. Daily Total: $62.36",6,88
"7:30 a.m. — My husband is up early to watch a soccer game. We both love lazy Saturday mornings spent in front of the TV with caffeine in hand and sleeping dogs on our laps. 12 p.m. — I've planned a surprise date to the zoo! One of our first unofficial dates was a trip to this zoo and it's the first time either of us has been back. I waited until the off-season started so tickets are cheaper. $14 2 p.m. — We are starved but nothing sounds good, so we finally decide on Applebee's. Contrary to most of my Applebee's experiences, the pasta I chose today was pretty disappointing. $22.34 4 p.m. — We finish our date walking around downtown for what we thought was our town's fall festival, only to find out that the bulk of excitement happened this morning. 6 p.m. — Since we've run out of leftovers, we do our weekly grocery trip to have something to make for dinner. $111.56 9 p.m. — I do a little tidying up and gather laundry for tomorrow so we can finish the night watching YouTube videos before heading to bed.

"5:30 a.m. — One of my cats (I have two) wakes me up around this time almost every day. He wants to aggressively snuggle and communicates that with head butts and loud purring. I am able to fall back asleep because the cat chooses to headbutt my partner, A., instead of me. 6:30 a.m. — Alarm goes off and I hit snooze until 7. Oops. This Monday is a little rough because we stayed at our friends' apartment in Hoboken over the weekend. We were up until 3 a.m. on Saturday and drank a lot of champagne and wine. I obviously haven't recovered from the late night yet. Am I getting old? I finally get ready at 7. I skip breakfast — a bad habit that I really want to break in 2018. I am never hungry in the morning but I would be better off eating something anyway. A. makes me a coffee and puts it in my travel mug, which I grab before leaving for work at 8:30. 9 a.m. — I am at my desk by 9 because my commute to work is very easy; it takes about 20 minutes max. I get settled, check my agenda for the week, and start emailing clients to check in. I wear a lot of hats at my company, I am the lead user experience designer, manage all ongoing UX projects, and some user research programs. Last week was busy and full of deadlines and I'm thankful this week is a little less hectic. 12 p.m. — I'm starving (I need to start eating breakfast) and instead of getting a healthy salad, I give into my craving for carbs and order pad Thai. The Thai place I usually order from is a short drive away and their lunch special is a great deal. (I work in a stuffy suburban town where a mediocre sandwich from the deli costs around $14. It is ridiculous.) I drive 10 minutes to an ATM to withdraw $40 cash (ATM fee is $3), then I pick up the order ($8.53) and chat with the lady for a bit. Back at the office, I eat my side salad and half of the pad Thai at my desk while reading this week's Money Diary. $11.53 2 p.m. — I have a case of the Mondays and can't focus for too long. I raid our office kitchen (it is always stocked with free snacks) for something sweet. I settle with a handful of pub mix and a can of Coke Zero before getting back to work. 6 p.m. — We had meeting after meeting all afternoon so I am a bit burnt out. I decide to call it a day and leave the office. I stop at Whole Foods on the way home for a few groceries so I don't order any more pad Thai for lunch this week. I get baby spring mix, romaine hearts, cucumbers, grape tomatoes, avocados, red onions, cauliflower, a bag of pepitas, two boxes of granola cereal (a request from A.), hemp milk, green tea, and mini chocolate cookies. I hate Whole Foods' prices but it is close to my house and the convenience is worth it. $45.58 7 p.m. — I do a load of laundry, watch some Bravo, and wait for A. to get home from work. I make salads with the groceries and pantry items. A. usually cooks dinner but I've been trying to share the dinner responsibilities lately! We watch the ""Milk Money"" episode of on Netflix and then the new episode of . We can't get enough of and I love that I got A. hooked on a silly reality show. We laugh out loud at James Kennedy the whole episode. 10:30 p.m. — I get in bed and work on the crossword puzzle on the app. I probably shouldn't do this before bed but it's nice bonding time for us after a long workday. Daily Total: $57.11",1,89
"6 a.m. — My alarm goes off and I hit snooze until 6:30. At 6:30, I put on music and I lay in bed looking at my phone. A. gets up to go to the gym while warning me to get to work early so I can leave early before it starts snowing this evening. I ignore this warning. I finally get out of bed around 7:20, put on , and get ready for work. 9 a.m. — It was lightly snowing on the way to work. At the office, I make myself a coffee and put hot water in a hot water bottle I keep at my desk. I use one at work all of the time, either for cramps or just to keep warm. (My office is freezing.) 9:30 a.m. — A. got me Kenzo sneakers for Christmas but they are too big so we plan on returning them. I take a break from work emails and browse the Kenzo website. I have been eyeing the Totem Flat Booties which are 50% off right now but my size isn't in stock. I sign up for a stock alert email. 12:30 p.m. — I heat up the second half of my pad Thai for lunch and grab a bag of Sun Chips from our office snack cabinet. I'm back on the Kenzo website. I convince myself that I should go for the heeled boots instead of the flat while they are on sale. Free shipping and the fact that we are returning the sneakers soften the blow. $228 1 p.m. — We need a new voice recorder for work, so I buy two on Amazon Prime that have the best reviews. ($135 expensed) 1:30 p.m. — I'm feeling groggy and unmotivated. I decide to leave the office and take a very cold but short walk to a coffee shop for a chai latte. The walk and the latte make me feel better. $3.46 5:45 p.m. — I try to leave work but end up talking to my boss for 30 minutes about workshop and speaker topics for an upcoming conference. 6:45 p.m. — At home, I play with the cats, do some chores, and make another big salad for dinner. I put on music and start writing my submission for conference speaker. When A. gets home, I stop working and we watch TV and talk until bedtime. 10:15 p.m. — A, and I get in bed but do not go to sleep until 11 due to long overdue quality time... It's hard to find time to be intimate when you are mentally exhausted from work, the news, family drama, and life overall. This is something we agreed to work on in 2018. Daily Total: $231.46",2,89
"6:30 a.m. — We wake up to a light snow storm and I hit snooze once. We lay in bed with the cats until 7:30, snoozing and chatting. I already know I'll be late this morning so I text a few people to warn them that I'll be in at 9:30. After getting ready, I make a salad for lunch and pour coffee in my to-go cup. A. cleans snow off my car (what a gem) while I bundle up for the weather. 9:30 a.m. — The drive to the office was easy because the roads are fairly clear. Someone brought in a giant container of chocolate chip cookies and I help myself to two. These will be gone by lunchtime in my office. 12 p.m. — I have a 12 o'clock meeting on Wednesdays so I grab the container of pub mix in our kitchen and bring it to the conference room to snack on. After the meeting, I offer to walk the office dog and we go for a chilly walk around the block in the snow. It is a nice mental break. 1:50 p.m. — I scarf down the salad I brought to work before a 2 o'clock meeting. The salad is really unsatisfying so I eat another chocolate chip cookie — the last one! 6 p.m. — I leave the office after A. calls to say he is working late tonight, meaning I'm on my own for dinner. On my way home, I stop to pick up an order of pierogis from a new Polish restaurant in my town. I need comfort food in this weather. $6.23 7:30 p.m. — Spend the rest of the night finishing the conference speaker submission and a thought leadership article for my company. A. and I jump into bed around 10. Daily Total: $6.23",3,89
"9 a.m. — I woke up late again today so I don't leave the house until 9. 11:45 a.m. — We have an internal lunch meeting so my boss asks me to grab lunch for the team in the meeting. I order hot subs from the Italian deli and pay with my company card. 2 p.m. — I received an invitation to a black-tie fundraiser event in the mail, which is exciting because I designed the invites for the host nonprofit organization. It looks great! I have been volunteering for them for five years now by offering my graphic design skills pro bono. I text A. and ask if he wants to buy us two tickets because his company might expense the event. 3:45 p.m. — Snacktime. I raid the kitchen for a handful of candied pecans and a bag of Sun Chips. Free snacks are crucial. 7 p.m. — Today was crazy busy. I finally call it quits at 7. I meet A. at home and we decide to get cocktails at a restaurant we haven't been to in a while. I order a delicious blood orange fizz cocktail. Since I've been eating salads, I go for a burger but it comes overcooked and I immediately regret my choice. A. pays the bill ($77.05) but puts it on Splitwise, which we usually settle at the end of each month if it is not even. $38.53 9 p.m. — We're home by 9 and I immediately get ready for bed. I'm exhausted. Daily Total: $38.53",4,89
"6:30 a.m. — I get up a decent time today. Get ready for work, eat a bowl of cereal with hemp milk, and take my time getting to the office. 9 a.m. — I get to work on time and put on headphones so I can get to work. I have two presentations to get out today and want to finish them by the early afternoon because I have meetings. 12 p.m. — I go for a walk during lunch. It helps me focus to get fresh air and move throughout the day. I can't sit too long. I grab hummus and chips from the office kitchen afterward. 5:30 p.m. — Today was another busy afternoon full of calls and meetings so I bounce at 5:30 after my last meeting. 6 p.m. — A. isn't hungry when he gets home so we both snack on things we already have. I make avocado toast and eat tortilla chips with salsa. This is common on Friday nights for us; we rarely feel like making meals at the end of the work week. We open a bottle of wine and watch the last episode of . 11 p.m. — Time for bed. Tomorrow is the Women's March on New Jersey in our town. I am excited to see how many people show up. Our town is full of activists and social justice organizations so it is a great venue for this event. Daily Total: $0",5,89
"7 a.m. — Up early to get ready to go to a fundraiser breakfast for Mikie Sherrill, a badass woman running for Congress in New Jersey District 11. We donated to her campaign a few weeks ago to secure tickets to this brunch. Since moving to this area five years ago, I have become more informed and involved with local politics through volunteering and attending events. A. and I think it is important to meet your representatives face to face, so we try to attend events and town hall meetings. 8:30 a.m. — Breakfast is packed. I am so happy so many people are here to support women running for office. We manage to get a bagel, coffee, and some pastries from the self-serve buffet. 10:30 a.m. — After breakfast, we head to the march to meet up with A.'s parents and uncle. We walk to the town hall to grab a spot and see the speakers and newly-elected governor. (BYE, CHRIS.) We manage to meet up with more family friends while we listen to the speakers. Around noon, we begin the march to the park in the middle of town. There are so many people; it's a huge turnout. At the park, the new governor is supposed to speak but he defers to his wife, who talks about a time she was sexually assaulted. I am a ball of tears. It's hard to hear but I am happy she told her story. 1:30 p.m. — We walk to our favorite place in town to grab takeout; it's a family-owned Mexican restaurant that we go to almost twice a week. We all order burritos and A. pays ($35). I buy Jarritos for a few of us while we wait for the food. $4 3 p.m. — After we eat lunch with A.'s family at our apartment, we say our goodbyes. At home, we grab a bottle of bubbly from our wine fridge and walk to a housewarming party for a friend who bought a house in our neighborhood. There are a lot of people, food, and wine, and it turns out to be a great time. I indulge in more than a few glasses of wine. 6:20 p.m. — We decide to leave the housewarming party with a group of friends to go get drinks. We try three different places before finding a fancy cocktail bar that isn't packed. The group orders cocktails and appetizers but I don't eat because I'm stuffed from 2 p.m. burritos. I offer to split the tab but I think A. splits the bill with our friend. 9 p.m. — We go to another bar. I am slowing down because I've been on my feet all day, and I only order water. We are able to sit and chat at this bar. We stay for a few hours until A. and I order a Lyft but the guy cancels twice on us! We decide to just walk. 11:30 p.m. — I pass out immediately after hitting the pillow. What a long day. Daily Total: $4",6,89
"10 a.m. — A. and I don't roll out of bed until late. I make us coffee and A. leaves to go work at his office for a few hours. I watch TV and read the newspaper. 12 p.m. — Half of my veggie burrito from yesterday is in the fridge. I add fresh cheese on top and heat it in the oven. While it is heating, I fry an egg too; leftovers are always better with an egg on top. 5 p.m. — I lounged most of the day, spending my time working on small portfolio projects or watching Bravo. A. gets home from the office and tells me his friends are at the bar watching football. I offer to give him a ride so I can pick up groceries while I'm out. I drop him off but instead of getting groceries, I just pick up sushi instead; groceries can wait. $12.68 6:30 p.m. — A. gets home and we spend the rest of the night catching up on shows. I am traveling two days for work this week so I'm feeling recharged after a lazy Sunday. Daily Total: $12.68",7,89
"8 a.m. — I lost my job a few months ago and have desperately been trying to be savvier about my spending. One of the first things we sacrificed was our gym membership. Paying $300-plus for eucalyptus towels was just too much. We have a small gym in our building and I go down there when I wake up and log a few miles on the treadmill before doing weights. 10 a.m. — Have a quick shower, eat a toasted English muffin, and go to my part-time sales associate job nearby. The store has been really quiet after Christmas, and hours are being cut so this is a shorter shift than I usually do. 4 p.m. — Finish work and head home. Quickly eat a couple of crackers and feed the cat before walking to a bar near my apartment to meet a friend I haven't seen for a while. We order a bottle of wine and finish it pretty quickly. We order one more glass, then meet my husband and some friends at a different bar around the corner. We split the check and pay $50 each. I order a Diet Coke at the next bar (my trick for keeping my hangovers at bay!) and my friend pays. It's so fun to be out with friends; life has been getting me down a bit recently and it's easy to end up spending weekends doing nothing in an effort to save money. We head to a BBQ bar and order a few plates to share along with a round of drinks. Split the bill between four and I pay my and my husband's share. We leave and decide to get one more drink at another bar. Husband's friend buys the round. $100 1 a.m. — On our way home, my husband says he is desperate for a Big Mac so we make a quick stop at McDonald's. I order a Filet-O-Fish — even though I'm not hungry — and my husband orders everything off the menu. $26 Daily Total: $126",1,90
"10 a.m. — We have a very lazy day today. I decided that 2018 would be the year I complete a half marathon, but the wine and the McDonald's have me feeling gross this morning. Instead of going for a run I make eggs for brunch. Whoops. Spend the rest of the afternoon watching Netflix, doing a few chores around the house, and napping. 5:30 p.m. — It was my birthday a few months ago and I was gifted tickets to on Broadway with Amy Schumer. The show was written by Steve Martin, whom I LOVE, so I'm very excited. We decide to eat dinner downtown instead of trying to find somewhere near Times Square and end up at a cute Italian place we've never been to before. We split an appetizer, husband orders lamb off the specials, and I go with pasta. Finish off the meal with crème brûlée and then almost have a heart attack when the check comes: the two bottles of still water we ordered were $9 each! $170 (including tip) 7:30 p.m. — Hop on the subway to Times Square and make our way to the theater where I buy another water and a bag of M&M's. Nearly have another heart attack when the bill comes to $10. I knew we should have stopped at Duane Reade to get snacks! $10 10 p.m. — The show was great and we briefly consider going for a drink before heading home but decide against it. We walk a few blocks to get on the subway away from Times Square and go home. Watch an episode of and eat my left-over M&M's with a glass of wine before going to bed. Daily Total: $180",2,90
"9:30 a.m. — We make it down to the gym this morning and run for 30 minutes. Have a quick shower and make our weekly meal plan along with a very nice Italian coffee my husband makes. I've been meal planning for as long as I can remember and I love how organized it makes me feel. Husband has to pop into work this morning for a few hours so I go grocery shopping, equipped with a list and reusable bags. I get salmon, kale, eggs, broccoli, onions, mushrooms, oranges, bananas, frozen veggie nuggets, and eggs. I also stock up on an incredible English cheddar my mother-in-law found when she came over a few months ago. I'm sorry, America, but your cheese is terrible and this stuff is delicious — expensive, but delicious. My husband and I are trying to make more time for dates and decided we'd make homemade pizzas tonight, so I also pick up dough, pizza sauce, and mozzarella. $76 11:30 a.m. — I make a quick stop at H&M to return a dress I bought before Christmas but end up exchanging it for a sweater, a jacket (which was a huge bargain at only $7!), a plain white t-shirt, and an ear cuff that I love even though it is probably too edgy for me. $50 2 p.m. — My husband is still at work so I catch up on on Hulu and eat scrambled eggs. It's such a gorgeous winter day that I decide to meet my husband; we go for a walk in the sunshine and get coffee. We have a long chat about how anxious I'm feeling about my career. I'm worried I'll never find a job over here and I'm really concerned about the effect that'll have when/if we move back home. $8 4 p.m. — We pop into a bodega on the way home and get chips and Diet Coke to have with our pizza tonight. We get back and watch a few hours of Netflix with homemade nachos before we make the pizza and watch another episode of . I swear, I've spent so much time on the couch this weekend that it's molded to my body shape. $8 Daily Total: $142",3,90
"8 a.m. — Same old, same old: wake up, scroll through Instagram for too long, go to the gym, and eat homemade muesli. 10 a.m. — I'm not due at work until later this afternoon so I decide to work on a few job applications. I've been lucky enough to get a few remote freelance gigs, but my last one ended just before Christmas and I need to find something new. Since losing my full-time job and struggling to get many interviews, my confidence has really taken a hit and I'm so close to giving up. I hate the job application process more than anything; I feel like every waking moment should be spent searching and applying, and I have a constant voice in my head telling me that I'm a failure. I had a great job back home and I don't understand why I'm not getting ahead here. I've tried everything — recruiters, reaching out to companies directly, using my (small) network of contacts. I know that “New York is a tough place,” but I feel like everyone else here has a job. Why don't I? 12 p.m. — I make eggs and sautéed kale for lunch and work on a cover letter for a role that's a bit of a career change. I'm not happy with how it's sounding, so I call it a day before walking to work for a short and sweet shift. 7:30 p.m. — A new noodle place opened up on our block and I saw on Instagram that they're offering 50% off for their soft launch. Arrange to meet my husband there for dinner but find out it's closed! We decide to go home and have a goat cheese salad for dinner instead. 9 p.m. — Remember I signed up to volunteer to read to schoolkids a few weeks ago, but I needed to complete an online form before I could enroll in orientation. Do the form in bed then fall into a very restless night of sleep. Daily Total: $0",4,90
"7 a.m. — I wake up feeling very grumpy and emotional. I've always been incredibly independent but since moving to the U.S., I feel like I've become a timid little mouse. Not good in a city as loud and crazy as New York. I miss the old me. I also hate the fact that my husband pretty much 100% financially supports me at the moment. I try to contribute what I can with my freelancing and part-time jobs but it feels like a drop in the ocean sometimes. I head down to the gym and blast Kanye and Beyoncé, hoping some of their confidence will rub off on me. It works, and I feel pumped for the day! I eat a bowl of muesli and a satsuma for breakfast and tidy the apartment, which always seems messy in the mornings. 11 a.m. — My eyebrows have officially merged and become one. I am in desperate need of a good thread, but the place I used to go was $40 with tip. I know, I know — but I'm super protective of my eyebrows and have had so many bad experiences that I just took the hit. Now though, it's time to stop being a snob. I go to a little place a customer told me about at work. It costs $10 with tip and I love the end result! I scold myself for wasting so much money on my eyebrows over the last two years. $10 11:30 a.m. — I have trouble concentrating at home so I go to a coffee shop and spend a few hours finishing the application I started yesterday. Fuel my work with coffee and a coconut macaroon and skip lunch. $4.50 4 p.m. — Make a quick stop at Target on my way home to get peppers, milk, and paper towels, which I forgot to buy on Sunday. End up buying a few other bits and pieces because it's Target and walk home. $15 7 p.m. — I make tofu Thai curry for dinner, which I end up eating alone as husband has to work late. Daily Total: $29.50",5,90
"8 a.m. — Decide to take a day off from the gym and potter around for a few hours before heading to work. It's taking all of my willpower not to do any online shopping but money is tight this month after we went home for Christmas. I really want to buy new clothes but I fight the urge! 3 p.m. — I have a couple of items to return to the store I work at, so I do that once my shift has finished. After, I meet my husband and we have coffee before I head home to work on yet another job application. I emailed the cover letter I was working on yesterday to my husband who gives me a bit of feedback. I tweak it, then go to apply and discover the job has been taken down. ARGH! So annoying. I wallow for a bit and watch before making roasted salmon with potatoes, kale, and broccoli for dinner. I feel very virtuous after a healthy dinner, but end up eating a huge bag of popcorn and half a packet of chocolate biscuits my mom sent me from home. $8 10 p.m. — Check my credit card balance before bed and see I forgot to cancel the three-month free trial for a résumé ATS scanner I signed up for, and I've been charged. Damn it. I'd better start having some luck with these job applications I'm sending off or I'll be pissed that I've wasted that money. $88 Daily Total: $96",6,90
"8 a.m. — I have the day off today and have woken up in a strop again after yesterday's vanishing job posting. Decide I need more Kanye and Beyoncé to cheer me up, so I head to the gym. I start my (very slow) run when a guy comes in and I feel bad that I'm on the treadmill. He makes it very clear he wants to run by standing around and looking at me instead of using the other equipment. I contemplate getting off so he can use it, but immediately feel annoyed with myself for even thinking that. I have as much right as he does to be on the treadmill and I vow to ignore him and finish my workout. I end up pushing myself further than I usually do and I feel super strong! 9:30 a.m. — Tidy up the apartment and clean the bathroom before I FaceTime my best friend, eating Greek yogurt with frozen peaches and granola while we talk. She always makes me feel better and I feel positive about life for the first time in a while. We decide that I should consider an internship. I spend a few hours doing more job applications, including one for an editorial internship and two remote part-time writing roles. 2 p.m. — I eat leftover Thai curry from the other day for lunch. It's another gorgeously crisp and sunny day so I wrap up, go for a walk, and treat myself to a coffee. $4 3:30 p.m. — Get back and feel revitalized! Sit at the table and do another job application, play with the cat for a bit, and find an internship I think I'd like to apply for. I worry that I'm too old and no one will want to hire me as an intern, but I try to address that in my cover letter. Fingers crossed! 7:30 p.m. — I make a disgusting dinner of Quorn chicken pieces and vegetables in a sauce made out of Diet Coke. It's really not very good but my lovely husbands eats it all. 8:30 p.m. — Finally get around to booking a pap smear. There's a big Instagram campaign at the moment in the U.K. encouraging women to get checked. I realize I'm a few years overdue so it's time to put my personal embarrassment aside and go for it. I'm getting my bikini line lasered on Sunday and I figure if I can let someone get up close and incredibly personal in the name of vanity, I can do it for my health, too. After a disappointing week, I treat myself to an at-home gel manicure kit from Amazon Prime. $77 Daily Total: $81",7,90
"7:30 a.m. — I wake up in an extremely frustrated mood. I was unable to sleep until 4:30 a.m. for some reason and I have a 10 a.m. meeting in the financial district. I do some light stretches and grumpily get ready for work. 8:45 a.m. — I get on an Uber and do my eyeliner, still in a mood. The ride is expensed; my company expenses transportation for travel to meetings before 9 a.m. or if the distance is quite far from home. ($15.80 expensed) 9:30 a.m. — I meet my bosses in a sandwich shop and discuss the presentation we're giving later. I grab a flat white and a ham and scrambled eggs wholemeal sandwich. My bosses and I talk about upcoming projects that I will have to run simultaneously as they travel for the next two weeks. $7.50 11:45 a.m. — That was a tedious one. I hitch a ride with one of my bosses back to the office. 12:30 p.m. — The office gets noisy as a group of freelancers come back from a technical recce. They invite me to lunch but I decline as I'm too busy and jumpy working on a current project. The reason for my jumpiness (and probably why I couldn't sleep last night) is because my end-of-year appraisal is today. I'm one out of few video producers in our small company, and it's been less than a year since I joined them. I'm terribly pessimistic about my performance at work, even though I've been told multiple times that I'm doing pretty well. My anxiety can get the best of me sometimes. 1:45 p.m. — I decide to join the group for lunch but am still too nervous to eat anything. I order a Thai iced tea and nibble on fritters. A coworker pays for my drink with the company card. 3 p.m. — I finish compiling photos of dresses that I've steamed for a wardrobe fitting tomorrow morning. My boss asks if I'm free to have the appraisal chat. Here goes nothing... 3:45 p.m. — That went super well. All of my bosses are pleased with how I've been doing despite me being new and offer me a pay raise as well as a bonus paycheck! Woo-hoo! I feel much better and call an Uber ($13.44 expensed) to pick up more dresses for the wardrobe fitting. 4:30 p.m. — I pay $12 for the dress with my own money. I'll be expensed for it after I fill out the claim form. I call an Uber to bring me to the nearest mall to pick up shoes. Funnily enough, I get the same driver! He seems to be a fun guy. The fare comes to $4.28 (expensed). 5 p.m. — I wander into Rubi and find a nice pair of cream wedges. There's a sale going on and I contemplate getting a chic pair of black platforms that only cost $15 ... but I resist and leave to get a very late lunch. 5:30 p.m. — I'm also supposed to find a fuchsia pink dress for tomorrow's fitting but it's so difficult! Everything's too gaudy. I give up and decide to get grilled rice with salmon for my late lunch. $12 6 p.m. — It's a miracle! I walk by a shop selling generic clothes and find a decent fuchsia pink dress. It was 50% off too! ($52.28 expensed) 6:30 p.m. — I've been feeling pretty bad flu-like symptoms today and waddle my way to the nearest pharmacy to get some flu pills. I also pick up Breathe Right strips since I'm sleeping over at N.'s house tonight. I've recently started snoring (something I detest in other people when they sleep) and it's been disturbing him. I feel like a shitty hypocrite. $8.20 7 p.m. — Catch another Uber back to the office and take a short nap. ($14.29 expensed) 7:15 p.m. — I get a bit of a tummy ache and am stuck in the bathroom for a bit. Things get kind of weird when my other producer starts asking me questions from outside the bathroom about work. I yell back saying that she can text me instead of asking me through the door, but she says it's important and then goes quiet. I exit the toilet and realize that the office lights have been switched off. What's going on? My colleagues surprise me with a huge ""Surprise!"" and sing ""Happy Birthday"" to me! My birthday's tomorrow and it's a really nice thing of them to do. They take a couple of photos and the office cat tries to swipe a taste of the cake. I pick the little guy up and pose for a photo. 7:45 p.m. — I finish the cake with my colleagues and get back to finishing a copywriting job. I'm staying late in the office today as N.'s flight from Bangkok lands at 8:30, and I'll meet him at his place. 8:45 p.m. — I walk to the nearest train station to get to N.'s place. I tap in with my preloaded train card and switch trains from the yellow to the purple and finally the green line. 9:45 p.m. — N. is ecstatic to see me. We haven't seen each other since mid-December as he was spending time with his family. I've really enjoyed spending time with him for the past two months and our relationship was kind of going somewhere, although it's not so great now. His company is in a bit of a situation and there's a huge possibility that he'll be returning to Switzerland. We sit down and talk about how things will progress and decide to go with the flow and enjoy what we have now. It's shitty but we try not to think about it. We snuggle and watch . 12 a.m. — He surprises me with a small ice cream cake and a candle. I get pretty emotional soon after as I receive a message from my mom, whom I haven't spoken to in three months. I moved out in September as things were very rough at home and my mental health was deteriorating. It's very uncommon for Asian kids to move out, especially at my age, so I've been a bit of a black sheep in the family. She apologizes for the things she said and did and asks if we can have dinner next week. I decide not to reply yet and cry for a little bit in N.'s arms. 1 a.m. — I get some happy birthday loving and fall asleep. Daily Total: $27.70",1,91
"6:30 a.m. — I wake up at a very odd hour. Apparently, with the flu and my snoring, it just got worse! I feel super bad and crawl out of bed to snooze on the sofa. N. refuses to let me sleep on the sofa and drags me back in. He's a swell guy; I'm going to be really sad when he leaves. 8 a.m. — We roll in bed some more and then quickly get ready for work. I have to be at the media campus by 8:45 and book an Uber. N. yells from the shower that he'll get reservations for my birthday dinner tonight. He gives me a wet kiss and I run down to catch the Uber. ($4.28 expensed) 8:45 a.m. — I get there on time and wait for my creative director and boss. 11:30 a.m. — The fitting goes pretty well and I hitch a ride back with my producer. We vaguely talk about our appraisals and complain a little about issues in the project. 12 p.m. — I cuddle the office kitty for a bit and continue sourcing dresses for other talent. This is getting annoying due to unreasonable demands... 1:30 p.m. — A group of colleagues and I head out for lunch. I'm not very hungry and order chicken cutlet rice and iced tea. $4.51 6:30 p.m. — As the day goes by, it gets really busy. I panic as I was supposed to leave an hour and a half ago to pack things to stay over at N.'s and then get the train to meet him for dinner in town. That's definitely not happening. I call an Uber back home ($5.26), pack up most of my things, and then book another Uber to meet him. I use a $5 discount code ($5.26). $10.52 7:15 p.m. — I am shook! I got a text from N. before seeing him saying that he wanted to get me something for my birthday but wasn't sure if it would be the right pick. After we kiss hello, he takes me to a bookstore and points to a Dan Brown book. Confused, I ask why Dan Brown (nothing bad about DB, just saying) and he cheekily tells me he's pulling my leg. Amused, I walk with him towards a game shop and he asks the shop owner to pick up the ""reserved gift"" — a brand new PlayStation 4! I've wanted one since last year but never bought it because it was more of a want than a need and I could definitely use the savings for much more important things. I get slightly tearful and give him the biggest hug ever. We also get a couple of games to play later. I'm excited! 7:50 p.m. — Since N. got me the PS4, I call an Uber to get to our dinner location. $5.26 10 p.m. — Dinner was at a popular Mexican place on a quaint hill in town. We have a reservation on the terrace with sparkling fairy lights. We order totopos con todo with salsa roja, piña habanero salsa and guacamole, tostada de atún, pollo quesadilla, tacos (carnitas, chorizo con res, camarónes), a margarita (for me), two micheladas with Coronas (for N.) and four shots of mezcal. I enjoy having good conversations with N. He graciously pays, stating it's a birthday dinner and my heart feels so full. 10:45 p.m. — I set up the PlayStation and we play Mortal Kombat XL for a while before going to bed. Daily Total: $20.29",2,91
"8:15 a.m. — We snuggle in bed until 9 and get ready for work. N. books an Uber and drops me off at work as usual when I stay over. 10 a.m. — I need to dive into work and start preparations for tomorrow's shoot. But first I call PlayStation Hong Kong to remove two-step verification from my original account. I've been procrastinating on this since November. It takes a while (their security is top notch!) and all's settled. I wait for a dress to arrive for the talent and continue prepping. 12 p.m. — I book a Grab (a Singaporean ride-share) to the talent's house with my director. ($5.25 expensed) 1 p.m. — I leave my director to assess the last few things at the house and book another Grab to get the last few items for the shoot. ($7.51 expensed) 1:30 p.m. — Purchase several necklaces and earrings as options, again using petty cash. I pick up a grey t-shirt, a belt-hole puncher, and a faux pearl necklace as well. Sourcing for wardrobe options can get tiring! ($49.45 expensed) 2:30 p.m. — I wander into the drugstore and pick up another pair of earplugs since the ones I got for N. didn't work so well. I also buy bottled water and anti-bacterial wipes. $10.80 2:50 p.m. — Book a Grab back to the office. ($8.26 expensed) 3:30 p.m. — This flu is seriously not getting any better! I suspect it's a viral infection and my boss tells me to go to the doctor. I walk to a nearby clinic and am prescribed antibiotics. I hope this works. $22.50 4:30 p.m. — An extremely enticing email pops up in my inbox. I've been meaning to try GuavaPass for the longest time and now they're offering a six-month unlimited class pass at $44. I go for it. The classes are all super interesting! I book an Ashtanga Mysore yoga class at 7 p.m. on Monday. $44 6:30 p.m. — I can't take it. My nose will end up being the death of me! I book a Grab to go home and my boss tells me to expense it. I've never been more grateful. ($5.25 expensed) 7:30 p.m. — After taking a short nap, I realize that I haven't eaten anything at all today. I get my ass up and walk to the nearby supermarket to get a few things. I'm too lazy to cook so I get store-bought sushi for dinner, as well as add frozen chicken breasts, Special K, and snow peas. $9 9 p.m. — I finish the sushi and make instant noodles. This is what I get for not eating all day and being lazy! 10:30 p.m. — I crash after taking a shower. Early call time tomorrow. Daily Total: $86.30",3,91
"6 a.m. — Up and at 'em. I book a Grab to get to my first location. ($12.71 expensed) 10:30 p.m. — That was a really, really, really tiring and shitty day. First shoot of the year and it was … unpleasant. My boss drops me off at the office with a huge pile of wardrobe items. It's also my weekend to cat-sit the office kitty, which perks me up. I book an UberPet to N.'s place, expensing it on my boss' account. 11:30 p.m. — N. is so happy to meet the kitty! He's more of a dog person but I've never seen him give so much love to a tiny, grey, moving furball. 1:30 a.m. — We both pass out. Daily Total: $0",4,91
"11:30 a.m. — It's a very lazy day for N. and me. We stay in bed and play with the kitty. 1:30 p.m. — We get up and decide to buy food and groceries to cook dinner. Halfway through the 10-minute walk, my stomach starts to cramp horribly. This is probably the result of taking the medicine without eating anything. I grumble the whole way with N. sympathetically patting my back. I see that the pastries that I found so delicious on set yesterday are being sold in the mall, and I wolf one down and feel much better ($2.60). I hate forgetting to eat. N. gets two grilled chicken burritos with tons of veggies and rice and bubble tea. When we settle in on the sofa back at the apartment, we look at each other and realize we didn't get groceries. Doy! $2.60 3:30 p.m. — We play Overcooked on the PS4 while the kitty nibbles on our ears. Around 5, I get sleepy and take a nap. I set the alarm to 7 p.m. to walk back to the supermarket and make dinner. 8:30 p.m. — Yeah, that didn't happen. It is most definitely a lazy day. N. orders Dominos. 10 p.m. — More Overcooked and pizza! Kitty tries to pounce on one of the pizzas and N. cuddles him tightly. 11:30 p.m. — Bedtime. We did not achieve anything today and promise to do more tomorrow. Daily Total: $2.60",5,91
"8 a.m. — N. and I are woken up by the kitty prodding our heads. We give him some kisses and refill his kibble bowl. 10:30 a.m. — We finally get up and shower. The kitty watches us from outside the glass door. Why. 11 a.m. — I messed up! My best friend got us tickets to and for some reason, I thought it was at 1:45. Turns out it's at 8 p.m.! My best friend and I make plans for me to return the kitty back to the office, set up the PS4 at my place, and take the bus to a dinner place near the movie theatre. N. has his helper coming over at 3 p.m. to clean up and he has to study too. We agree to meet up again after the movie ends. For now, we head out to get lunch. 1 p.m. — It's sweltering outside. Typical Singapore. I get chicken rice and sugarcane juice for both of us. N. gets lor mee (a Chinese-inspired dish with thick, starchy gravy and yellow noodles) with shark nuggets. I chastise him quietly for contributing to the extinction of sharks. He pays for our lunch and we walk back, looking around at the quaint houses in his neighborhood; it's pretty gentrified but still so beautiful. We also get two pricey but delicious coffees at a nearby hipster café. N. covers this as well. 2:30 p.m. — I kiss N. goodbye and he gets ready to call his family. He's an Orthodox Christian and apparently, it's Christmas today. I wait for the UberPet to take me to the office and use my boss' card again. The kitty looks kinda bummed to leave. 3:30 p.m. — I handle the kitty's needs and meet up with my best friend to take the bus back to my place. We discuss the movie and my friend's enlistment life. 4 p.m. — We play Overcooked! It starts to rain heavily and we worry a little about how to get to the dinner place. I quickly do a load of laundry and we leave. 6:30 p.m. — We get to the place on time and I get kind of suspicious when my best friend starts looking shifty. He brings me out to the patio and one of my best girlfriends is sitting there! Apparently, they've been planning to surprise me for a while. I am definitely surprised and am very happy to see my friend. We have a nice dinner of chicken karaage don (me) and kimchi ramen (best friend). They decline my efforts to pay. 7:30 p.m. — All three of us slowly make our way to the movie theater and I am greeted with surprise number two: my second best girlfriend carrying two huge balloons with the number two on them! I am mortified and also very amused. They know I hate grand gestures and snap photos of me looking embarrassed as heck. We stash the balloons in my friend's car and head up to the movie. It's a small, local theater that mostly screens indie films. We get three bottles of Evian, Thai iced tea, and fries. They pay for this, too. 10:30 p.m. — That. Was. Amazing. Holy shit, it was so good! Armie Hammer looks so delicious. Kinda sucks as he and Timothée Chalamet reportedly support terrible men as directors (whom I will not bother to name). We decide to go back to my place for a round of beers, a local version of Cards Against Humanity, and garlic bread. 12 a.m. — My girlfriend agrees to drop me off at N.'s place. I am so very, very, very grateful to all of them. I hug them goodbye and head up to meet a sleepy N. Bedtime soon after. Daily Total: $0",6,91
"7:30 a.m. — There is a huge thunderstorm outside and I don't want to get up. Ever. We snuggle in and get up an hour later. 9 a.m. — N.'s Uber takes way too long to arrive so I book one on my app instead. It gets here much faster and he passes me a $50 note to cover it. The Uber drops him off first then takes me to my office. The whole trip is $22.26 — that's $10 extra! I guess I can't complain because of the thunderstorm. 10 a.m. — I refill my water bottle and eat French vanilla granola with milk, and the kitty comes by and tries to get a taste. I slowly pack up the items used for the shoot two days ago and do my reimbursement form. It comes up to more than $70. Great! I submit it to my producer. 12:30 p.m. — My colleagues are already hungry and craving Korean food. We take a 10-minute walk to the nearest mall and the Korean place is packed. Seems like a bad idea, but we still manage to get seats. I get kimchi chicken ramen with iced green tea while they get kimchi beef ramen and saba fish with rice. $4.50 1 p.m. — I repair my screen protector since it got badly damaged when we used as a prop on set. The art department guys promised to pay me back and the cost is $21.70. My colleagues get bubble tea and I decide to get one too ($2.25). $23.95 2 p.m. — I start working on a new project that needs six new copies. (I also do copywriting and conceptualization besides producing.) 6:15 p.m. — I leave the office, rushing to my Ashtanga Mysore class at 6:45. Unfortunately, I forget that the rush hour for buses is terrible and end up arriving at 7:05 after transferring to another bus. 8 p.m. — That was a really good session. It's my first time and I feel calm for the first time in a few weeks. I sweated so much! I wait for a bus to get to the nearby mall that has a supermarket, where I order a big sushi roll made with brown rice, shredded carrot, chicken, cucumber, and unagi slices. ($8.18) I also pick up some ingredients to make teriyaki sauce: cornstarch, low-sodium soy sauce, ground ginger, brown sugar, and extra-fine grain bread ($17.26). $25.44 9 p.m. — I take the long bus back to my place and get on GuavaPass to book more classes. I choose a pole class on Wednesday and an Intense Ride class on Sunday. I've filmed at the gym where the ride class is being held and the location is pretty sweet! 10 p.m. — I take out chicken breasts to defrost and then hop into the shower. After, I prepare the teriyaki sauce and stir fry the chicken with boiled snow peas. The brown rice finishes cooking and I prep three days of lunches and dinners before eating Ben & Jerry's ""Everything But The…"" and watching old episodes of . 12:30 a.m. — Bedtime.

"8 a.m. — After I drop off my daughter at my grandmother's house (she lives fives minutes away by foot) I take the bus to work using my monthly card. I'm starving and I won't be able to stop for lunch until 1 p.m. today. Because I'm a little early on time, I make a quick stop at a boulangerie and get a croissant ($1.20) and a café crème ($2.45) that I eat on their outside table. I enjoy the rays of sunshine with my breakfast. $3.65 11:45 a.m. — I look after a group of 16 children between the 18 months and three years old. They are adorable — and a lot of work — but right now they're all sound asleep with full tummies and clean diapers. I enjoy the quiet time and make the most of it by ordering my lunch on Deliveroo. That app is my Kryptonite. I usually bring lunch from home but I was away all week end and came home quite late on Sunday. I drool over a million possibilities and end up ordering a quiche with a side salad, an iced coffee, an orange, and olive oil loaf cake slice. I pay using a $6 luncheon voucher; I get 20 of them monthly at work. $12 6 p.m. — Finally, my workday is over! We've had many sick coworkers lately, so work has been tough. I get off the bus and go straight to the supermarket. I really just want to pick up my daughter and go home, but my fridge is empty and that would mean having takeout again, which is unreasonable. I get a bag of oranges, bananas, tangerines, almonds, zucchinis, lemons, mushrooms, olives, potatoes, chestnuts, brussels sprouts, muesli, milk, a jar of arrabiata tomato sauce and a jar of plain tomato sauce, pesto, pasta, semolina, Greek yogurts, goat cheese, rocket salad, a jar of soup, a pack of falafel, chickpeas, lentils, eggs, dark and milk chocolate, brioche, ground coffee, shampoo, and toothpaste. I make a quick stir fry with the zucchinis, mushrooms and the olives and add the spaghetti into it. We also have some chocolate for dessert. $74.10 Daily Total: $89.75",1,92
"9 a.m. — I stop at the ATM on my way to work to get cash for my coworker who bought our new coffee machine. I pay back my share ($12). Today, I ate muesli, Greek yogurt, and bananas from home for breakfast, and I brought yesterday's leftovers and two tangerines for lunch. I walk past my local boulangerie — without going in — with a sense of pride! $12 3 p.m. — My colleague fancies a bubble tea delivery. I join in for an iced coffee, and two other colleagues order iced teas. I pay on Deliveroo ($22) and they pay me back their shares immediately. $5.5 7 p.m. — I stop at the pharmacy to get painkillers ($3) for terrible headaches I've been having lately. While I'm there, I buy a face cream ($18) and almond oil for my daughter's skin. I have a refillable bottle so it's $8 dollars instead of $12. $29 Daily Total: $46.50",2,92
"7 a.m. — I start extra early today as it's my turn to open the nursery and parents start coming at 7.30 a.m. It's too early for me to eat when I leave home to drop off my daughter at 6, so I pack some bananas and almonds to munch on later. I also make myself a nice café crème with our brand new machine while I wait for the parents to arrive. 12 p.m. — Today, I have half the day off. I pick up my daughter from tennis practice and we stop at a local bistro, Café Longchamp, for lunch. We share a baby leak salad (that I end up eating all by myself), and each have an omelet with fries. (The adult portion costs $3.50 more.) For dessert, she also gets a scoop of chocolate ice cream from the kids' menu while I have an espresso ($1.80). $29.30 2 p.m. — We walk past the carousel and my daughter wants to ride it; she does it three times as it's only $6 for three tickets! She loves it; they blast Disney songs and she sings her little heart out when ""Let It Go"" starts playing. After that, we stop at our favorite bookstore. The owners are three lovely ladies who are super into children's literature. They always give great advice and take the time to flick through so many albums with my daughter. She chooses two books and I pick up a novel and two books I ordered a couple of weeks ago for work on child development. The latter costs $37 but is for our shared bookshelf at work; I'll get a full refund tomorrow. $40 4:30 p.m. — After a stroll around the harbor, my daughter falls asleep in her stroller so I decide to stop at my favorite clothes shop, Des Petits Hauts. I want to buy everything! Sales are on, and I end up buying a brooch shaped like the planet Saturn at 50% off ($15.50); a much-needed pair of brown suede boots, also 50% off ($147) because I go through shoes very quickly and had no decent daywear shoes left; an oversized, white wooly cardigan at 70% off ($82); a pretty, flowery silk scarf at 50% off ($92); a white blouse at 70% off ($64), and a little black dress at 70% off ($59). I pay with the gift card I received for my 30th birthday. I've been saving it for a good sale and that was definitely the right move! I still have some money left on the card. (I've been very spoiled!) We go home and I make spaghetti all'arrabbiata for dinner and put the leftovers in a lunchbox for tomorrow. Daily Total: $69.30",3,92
"8:30 a.m. — I don't need to be at work today until 10 a.m., so I make toast with butter and jam and freshly squeezed orange juice for breakfast and I take my daughter to school. Thursdays are the only days I can do this so I enjoy every minute of it. After I drop her off, I go and grab a coffee and a croissant at a local café with a mother I've been friends with since my daughter and her son were in nursery school together. It's nice catching up on the school gossip — and she knows it all. My treat. $5 1 p.m. — I've only been at work for a few hours when my daughter's school calls to inform me that she has a fever and isn't feeling well at all. I call my gran so she can pick up my daughter while I make my way back. She is sleeping when I get home. I wait for her to wake up and heat up soup from the fridge for lunch with a little salad and a yogurt. I call the pediatrician who accepts to see her after hours. The consultation is $39 and I'll have $20 paid back in a couple of days by social security. She has a case of angina and gets prescribed painkillers and throat soothers. I go the pharmacy get the medication; it's $7.50 and will be paid back in full on my account in a few days by social security. Back at home, I make her soup; she hardly eats anythings and sleeps a lot. I call my manager to let her know I won't be working tomorrow either. I snack for dinner and binge-watch on Netflix. $19 Daily Total: $24",4,92
"11:30 a.m. — My daughter isn't feeling great and we stayed in all morning. We order in with Deliveroo. I get cream of tomato soup, avocado and cream cheese bagels, and cupcakes from an American bakery. Everything costs $25 but I put two $6 luncheon vouchers towards it. My daughter loves it, especially the pretty red velvet cupcakes. $13 3 p.m. — I decide some fresh air would do us good and bundle her up in her stroller to go for a walk around the beach. She even comes down to throw pebbles. We get crepes and hot chocolates from a cart ($12) and eat while watching the peaceful sea, enjoying the winter sun. We meet up with my mum and on our way back home, we stop at a vintage toy shop and my mum decides to buy a treat. My daughter chooses a tiny wooden doll house ($25) and a tea set ($15). $12 7 p.m. — Our walk tired her out. She nibbles on breadsticks and cheese, takes her medication, and goes to sleep. I buy our train tickets online for our trip to Paris in the spring ($122). (We live 500 miles away from Paris.) I also buy tickets to go up the Eiffel Tower ($46) since I hear they sell out very quickly. I catch up on reading, eat snacks for dinner again, and fall asleep very quickly. $168 Daily Total: $193",5,92
"11 a.m. — Today my daughter wakes up super early and is determined to go to her morning dance class. I hesitate and give in; if she gets too tired, I won't be far so I can pick her up. I take her to her class with the bus (free until the age of six, and my daughter is four). I go to a nearby shop and pick up things we need for the house while I wait — light bulbs, a small beginner's toolbox, a bath rug, some bowls, and a salad bowl. $47 12 p.m. — Her dance class is finished, she is fine, and she is up for her playdate with my friend's child. On our way over to their house, we stop at a boulangerie to get pastries to bring with us ($18). My friend treats us with delicious paninis for lunch. The kids have a great time and so do the grownups. $18 6:30 p.m. — My mum comes to pick up my daughter for the night, I have a date, well, a double-date really; it's my friend's boyfriend's neighbor/friend. When they leave, I rush through the door; there's not a decent pair of tights to wear. I pick up three pairs ($29) at my local shop, along with bobby pins ($3.50) and concealer ($8) $40.50 8 p.m. — We meet for drinks at a winery. We each buy rounds ($34) and share tapas ($20 but my date pays). It's a lovely, cozy place; everyone is very friendly and the wine is excellent. We leave to catch a late movie showing. $34 9:45 p.m. — We just make it on time to see . I insist on paying for my own ticket but the guys are sneaky and beat us to it. So, I pay for the popcorn ($17) and my friend pays for the drinks. We all enjoy the movie a lot; Jessica Chastain never disappoints. It's long past midnight when we come out and I'm very tired. I call an Uber and my date waits for it with me. It was a lovely evening. I don't have dates or even nights out very often. $17 Daily Total: $156.50",6,92
"9 a.m. — It's Sunday! My favorite day of the week. I love how everything slows down on a Sunday; lazy days are the best. I ask my neighbor to watch my daughter, who is still asleep, while I get breakfast. It's an agreement we have: I get croissants, pains au chocolat, and baguettes ($6.50) and I give a couple to my neighbor as a thank you. I also get a small bouquet of wild flowers from a stall by the shop ($6). I also buy ingredients for lasagna at the small grocery store next to the bakery ($17) $29.50 1 p.m. — We eat the vegetable lasagna I made earlier and watch on pay-per-view ($6.20). How good is Studio Ghibli! $6.20 2:30 p.m. — The whole family goes to my grandmother's house for coffee and cake. This is what good Sundays are made of! I pay my cousin for my share of my grandmother's birthday present. My daughter has a blast playing with her cousins and it's hard to get her home. $40 Daily Total: $75.70",7,92
"6:30 a.m. — I start the day with a cup of blackberry tea and a scoop of collagen protein. I usually hit the gym by 5:30, but I slipped and twisted my ankle over the weekend and am trying to give it a rest. The warm weekend weather melted the snow but with temps dropping overnight, I figure I should get up and going so as not to be late to work due to bad roads. 8:15 a.m. — My intention to get to work on time failed, but with my executives out of the country, no one seems to notice or care and I go about my morning routine. I heat my overnight oats in the microwave for a minute (blueberries, oatmeal, unsweetened coconut milk, and collagen protein) and grab a mug of hot water to make tea at my desk. 10 a.m. — I am hungry but am trying to figure out if I am just eating out of boredom. Weeks when my executives are traveling are always slow. I snack on a few gluten-free cheddar crackers for a snack from my food drawer. I keep a designated food drawer to keep me from spending all my money and calories at the office vending station. 12 p.m. — My mom texts to ask if I want to come over for lunch. I grab my lunch from the office fridge and head to her house. About two weeks a month, I order prepared lunch meals from a local meal prep company at $10/meal. My mom and I chat and I eat a not-so-satisfying veggie burger and sip a cup of ginger tea. Spending time with my mom always brightens my day. 2:30 p.m. — Work is very slow today. I dive weeks deep in a fitness vlogger's YouTube account, something I have no actual interest in. It's about time for an afternoon snack, so I pull a protein peanut butter cup out of my drawer and try to eat it without making a crumbly mess on my keyboard. 4 p.m. — My cousin texts my mom and I that she's nearby for an appointment and asks if we want to meet up for happy hour. I dip out of work an hour early and meet them both for a cocktail and a cheese plate. Cheese = my favorite part of life. I pick up the tab and tip because my mom raised me and my cousin is a newly-employed teacher $28.11 7 p.m. — My boyfriend, Chris*, heads out of town tomorrow for the remainder of the week, so I make dinner tonight at his place. We eat salmon, broccoli, and brown rice while we catch up on each other's days. After we clean up the kitchen, I help him pack for the week. He hates traveling for work and I do my best to lighten his mood. We have a very fun black-tie event the evening he gets home and both of us are very much looking forward to it! It's an automotive industry event often referred to as AutoProm. 9:30 p.m. — I make a cup of Sleepytime Tea, turn on some music, and fall asleep wondering if Chris knows where his bowtie is.

"6:30 a.m. — I skip the gym again today hoping my ankle is better by tomorrow. I forget my morning tea and collagen and feel very foggy this morning. 8:30 a.m. — I am somehow late to work again today. I put my overnight oats in the microwave and grab a mug of hot water for tea. I dread days without my executives. I feel so unfulfilled at work without a lot going on. At least my oats taste like a warm blueberry muffin. 9:30 a.m. — I walk to the office fridge and pull out a Wella Bar (Awesome Almond!), reminding myself to enter this in MyFitnessPal. My gym is doing a six-week challenge and we're in the second week. 10:55 a.m. — More boredom snacking. I pull a bag of SmartPop out of my desk. 11 a.m. — I am now craving Chipotle. I brought lunch to work, but my craving gets the best of me. After browsing the nutritional content online, I place a pick-up order for a steak burrito bowl, sans rice. $8.32 12 p.m. — I leave the office and head to a quick-change oil shop. My car has been reminding me to change my oil for over a week now. I usually hate getting my oil changed because the staff is so unfriendly and tries to up-sell me on everything, but today is my lucky day, I pull in and the staff is friendly and efficient. I am out of the shop with an oil change, a new air filter, and a refill on my wiper fluid in under 15 minutes. I make a note to leave a Google Review for the wonderful service $88.11 12:30 p.m. — I stop and pick up my burrito bowl. Oh, how I love Chipotle. I start to head back to the office but see a big red Target sign looming ahead on my right. A self-proclaimed shopaholic, I recently evaluated my finances and am trying to get my shopping-for-sport under control. Today, I resist the urge and am very proud of myself. I think of my savings account increasing and wonder when Mint will send me another congratulatory email on my newly developed spending habits. 12:33 p.m. — Just past Target, I spot a new health food market and pull in to get a bottle of kombucha. In a severe lapse of judgment, I gave up coffee for the month of January and have been replacing my afternoon coffee craving with a bottle of kombucha. It's on sale, two for $7. I also grab a Pink Lady apple and a container of pre-cut mixed berries. $13.78 7 p.m. — I'm craving something for dinner but, not wanting to do much about it. I stop by my parents' house and there's a pot of homemade chicken noodle soup on the stove, so I help myself. My dad and I end up asking Alexa the most ridiculous questions we can think of. Turns out, the love of Alexa's life is R2-D2. Can't blame the bot for that! I love spending time with my family. I always leave feeling so blessed and peaceful. 8 p.m. — I get home to a package in my mailbox! I walk into my studio and drop everything in the middle of the kitchen floor to open up my package. It's grain-free granola I ordered from a Chicago-based blogger I follow. 9:30 p.m. — After tidying my studio, making a list of a few things I need for home, and talking to Chris on the phone, I finish a cup of decaf tea and go to bed. I am an introvert by nature and usually don't mind when Chris travels for work, but I missed him a lot today. Daily Total: $110.21",2,93
"5 a.m. — Up and at the gym for the 5:30 a.m. class. I like to work out on an empty stomach so I grab my water bottle and head out the door. The group fitness instructor is a no-show (weird, but I've never liked her) so everyone bands together and kicks ass with a group workout on the fly. I am not usually hungry immediately following a workout but this morning I consider my gym shoe a viable snack. 7:30 a.m. — Out the door a little early for work. With Chris out of town, I realize how little I keep at home. I go to the market to pick up a few things to keep at the office, including frozen blueberries, unsweetened coconut milk, and Siggi's yogurt (two for $3!). I charge $10.48 to Chris' card. I get to work just before 8 a.m. and mix in a handful of the grain-free granola I got last night in with the yogurt I bought. So good! I resist immediately eating another yogurt with more granola and text my girlfriends who also work out at my gym. We bash the instructor who didn't show this morning; nothing like a good group-text vent session. 10:15 a.m. — My executives are on their way back and clearly purchased Wi-Fi during the flight; my inbox is on fire. It's the fire and chaos that makes me love my job. I grab a mug of hot water and make a cup of blackberry tea, glad to escape boredom snacking this morning. Another protein peanut butter cup should get me through until lunch. 12 p.m. — Mom texts me just as I'm walking out the door for lunch. She asks if I'm bringing dresses over to try on. My Rent the Runway delivery for AutoProm should have arrived by now, but I got a delayed notification from UPS. I decide to go see my mom anyway. We eat chicken noodle soup and warm chocolate zucchini muffins as we talk about the family cat (whom I think is possessed). I stop at my favorite coffee shop on my way back to the office and get a blueberry tea with the gift card Chris got me for Christmas. He calculated what one coffee or two teas a week would be for a year and put it on a gift card. My most thoughtful and appreciated gift this Christmas! The staff asks how my coffee moratorium is going, I sigh and say it seems to be getting harder. They remind me I'm halfway through the month and a coconut milk latte isn't far off in my future. 1 p.m. — My inbox is full and I've got a full list of tasks to complete, including trying to resolve a hotel room fiasco for an upcoming international trip. Moving my executives to a lesser hotel halfway through a conference our company is sponsoring? Not happening on my watch. 4 p.m. — George*, my favorite executive, touches down in Detroit and is in full effect. I convince him to delay coming into the office because he is never that effective post international travel. I open the second bottle of kombucha I bought yesterday and debate leaving work early to grab my Rent the Runway rental, but after tracking online, I realize it still hasn't been delivered. Officially getting worried. 5 p.m. — I have enough time to swing by the store to pick up a few things I didn't buy yesterday. A few staples turn into a lot of impulse purchases, like a dessert-flavored tea. I hate myself for this. I consider putting it all on Chris' card because I know he wouldn't mind, but I know these are all for my place and put it on mine. At the checkout, I take out $20 in cash for tips I'll need on Friday. $45.16 6 p.m. — The spray tan studio is packed for AutoProm. I'm easily the youngest person there by 20 years but I don't mind; the older ladies are hilarious. While I am waiting, Rocksbox sends me an email reminder to return my items but damn it, I love one of the necklaces and I have an account credit to use! (I canceled my subscription when I set up my budget at the beginning of the month.) It's only $30 after I apply my $29 account credit. I get sprayed down and purchase a bottle of tan extender. $85.78 8:30 p.m. — My Rent the Runway is finally delivered and disaster strikes: Two dresses don't fit and the one that does has a massive rip down the side. I call Rent the Runway in a panic and get a customer service specialist who couldn't care less about my plight. After a 20-minute call and full-on customer service 'tude, I hang up and try to focus. I open up my laptop to search local department stores' current stock online. I realize my internet isn't working and remember I canceled my Wi-Fi when my provider tried to jack my bill up by $50 over six months ago. (Shows you how often I'm really at my place.) I use my cell phone as a hotspot, saying cheers with a cup of tea to unlimited data from my work phone plan! 10 p.m. — I've purchased three dresses I feel lukewarm about for store pickup tomorrow from the larger mall about 40 minutes from me ($603.25 on Chris' card). I figure I can take a longer lunch tomorrow to pick them up. That gives me four hours after work if those dresses don't fit to hunt something down near me. I wish I lived somewhere with better local shopping. I call Chris to update him on my plight and promptly fall asleep. I've always appreciated my ability to sleep even when I'm stressed. Daily Total: $130.94",3,93
"7:40 a.m. — Out the door a little early. Forget to make tea. I want to wash the salt and slush off my car before I get to work. Fueling female driving stereotypes since 2005, I nearly cause an accident pulling into the car wash when I forget to put my car in neutral. $6 9 a.m. — I am so distracted by the dress situation that I start drinking my mug of hot water without a tea bag. George is in the zone and I am glad he is back. He encourages me to take a long lunch to pick up my dresses. I grab my yogurt from the fridge and granola from the drawer and am excited about breakfast because it tastes so good. 1:30 p.m. — Back in the office after my lunchtime sprint to pick up my dresses. I buy two salads from Whole Foods on my way back for George and me. ($11.58 expensed) 3 p.m. — My salad sits on my desk untouched. I open my drawer looking for something else but don't find anything appetizing. I take a LaCroix from my fridge stash instead. Why am I so wasteful? I let George know there's an extra salad in the fridge for tomorrow's lunch since I won't be in and he's not the best at feeding himself. 7:30 p.m. — After work, I put on a fashion show for my mom, baby brother, and sister-in-law. We all agree on a dress and I go to the local mall to get a pair of shoes for the new dress ($135.66). They are pricey but I've needed a good pair of black pumps for a while. After, I meet one of my besties for dinner. He recently started working at my company (yay!) but with our schedules, it's been hard to even get lunch together. I am glad to catch up with him and am getting more and more excited for AutoProm. We're fluid about who picks up the tab. I think it's my turn, so I pay ($49.04). $184.70 9 p.m. — My usual decaf tea, phone call with Chris who is at the airport ready to fly home, and off to bed. Very excited for tomorrow but my love of sleep captures me quickly. Daily Total: $190.70",4,93
"6:30 a.m. — My internal body clock wakes me up earlier than I'd like, so I lay in bed but my restlessness gets the best of me and I'm up early. 9:30 a.m. — Out the door with a pile of items to return. By 11 a.m., I've returned $450.56 worth of dresses to Chris' credit card and another $173.86 for the shoes I purchased for my original dress to my personal card. I am feeling good about this as my new dress and shoes ultimately cost me less than what Rent the Runway would have. While I'm still bitter, party of one, when it comes to Rent the Runway, I did get a full refund and a credit for my next rental. 3 p.m. — With my hair ($35 plus a $10 tip) and makeup done (free as I am a VIP Rouge member at Sephora, meaning I spent $1,000 at Sephora in the last calendar year), I swing by Chipotle to get Chris and me something to eat ($15.58) before we head out. $60.58 5 p.m. — We arrive at the AutoProm pre-party. Chris had a heated work call on the way and I worried it would prevent him from enjoying the evening but upon arriving, we happily run into several friends and enjoy free food and drinks as the night begins! 11 p.m. — After hours of fun, food, and drinks, we venture out on our own. Everyone thinks AutoProm is about the cars. It's not — it's about the unparalleled people-watching: the glam, the weird, and the just plain ugly. I love it! We hop to a few of our favorite bars, including an Irish pub with $1 jello shots. Chris picks up the bar tabs and I pay for the Ubers. I grab a cup of water from the last bar as our Uber home pulls up and hiccup the entire way home in my fancy gown like the classy lady that I am. $47.87 Daily Total: $108.45",5,93
"12 p.m. — I sleep until noon, something I almost never do. I am fairly hungover, as I knew I would be, and so is Chris. I drive us to our favorite breakfast diner for hangover sustenance. Chris does a bit of work on his phone and I browse social media and photos from the night before. Chris picks up the bill. 1:30 p.m. — After I drop off Chris at his car, I stop at a coffee shop and get an overpriced cup of tea before I take a lazy drive through the city with my heat blasting and windows down. It's nearly 50 degrees in January! Hangover or not, I live for sunny days in the dead of winter. $3.25 3:30 p.m. — The sunshine and fresh air are calling our names. Chris and I take our bikes out of the garage and do a slow loop around town. It is cold but the sunshine and fresh air feel great! We talk about all the bike rides we want to take in the spring and summer. 6 p.m. — I make a veggie and shrimp stir fry at home. After a quiet dinner, we are both still very hungover and craving something sweet. Chris runs to Target for Halo Top and I make a box of Simple Mills chocolate chip cookies to crumble on top while we watch . Curled up on the couch with soft blankets, I smile at Chris and tell him we're living the dream. 8:30 p.m. — I am ready for bed. I make a cup of decaf tea that I barely finish before I fall asleep. Daily Total: $3.25",6,93
"9 a.m. — I sleep in later than normal again. Time for tea and a quick breakfast of eggs over easy, spicy chicken sausage, and brown rice. I scarf it down before I get ready for church. 11:15 a.m. — Chris and I recently started attending a new church. I am so moved by the sermon, I tear up during the prayer. 12:30 p.m. — On our way to my parents' house for family brunch, Chris and I take a detour to a nearby bar for one cocktail. He is feeling very stressed and anxious today and I know it's always helpful to sit and talk it out. His career is incredibly fast-paced and high-stress, so I try to be considerate of that as much as possible. 1:30 p.m. — My mom makes an amazing spread for brunch as per usual: two different quiches, cinnamon bread, sausage, bacon, and fruit. We catch up with my family and I suspect that my youngest brother is recovering from a night of shenanigans since he seems slightly hungover. Sunday brunch with my family is one of my favorite parts of every week. 3 p.m. — Chris and I planned to stop at Costco on our way back to his house but we completely ignore our responsibilities for the day and go to the next town over for Sunday Funday instead. We hop to five different bars, have a drink at each, spend hours talking, and split an app at the last one. Chris picks up the tabs. 7 p.m. — We're back home. Friday night was a blast but there's nothing like quality time with just the two of us. I check the fridge and confirm I have enough food to make it through Monday, though I'll have to stop at Costco after work tomorrow night. I don't like running errands after work, especially on Mondays, but I know Chris needed a relaxing day today. I hope the week ahead isn't too difficult for him. 9:30 p.m. — I make a cup of decaf tea and add a splash of honey, which naturally means I down it in a matter of minutes. My sweet tooth always gets the best of me, even in small ways. I put on my noise-canceling headphones but don't think I make it through one song before I fall asleep. Daily Total: $0",7,93
"7 a.m. — Even though it's the weekend, we're up early with our puppy. I eat a bowl of oatmeal and make eggs for my husband while he brews our coffee and feeds our dog. (I haven't been able to stomach the smell of her food since becoming pregnant eight months ago.) A couple of years ago, I gifted my husband a subscription to a Coffee of the Month club as a birthday present. We loved it so much that we kept it. The first week of every month, we get two pounds of fair-trade coffee beans delivered to our house from our favorite roaster in Northern California. We also invested in a grinder (which we bought using my husband's Amazon rewards credit so it was technically free), a scale, Chemex, and kettle. In the long run, the cost comes out to about $1 per cup of delicious coffee — way cheaper than what we would pay at a café. 12 p.m. — My morning is spent watching on Hulu, washing and putting away the first six months' worth of baby clothes we received at our shower (what does one do with all the tiny socks?!), cleaning the house, and munching on potato chips with homemade hummus. There's no food at home so we decide to go to the farmers' market for lunch and groceries. Before ordering lunch, we buy what we need/want from the market: red fife sourdough bread which has only three ingredients, apple spice jam, persimmons, and mandarins. $30 1 p.m. — We share three pupusas for lunch from one of the booths at the farmers' market. I try to convince my husband to get dessert at a bakery nearby but we both resist the temptation. $9 1:30 p.m. — After the farmers' market, we head over to Trader Joe's to do our weekly grocery shopping. This week, we're making beef and bean chili and Southwestern chicken salad so we get ingredients for those, plus food for our dog, cereal, milk, eggs and snacks. $84 7 p.m. — I spend the rest of the afternoon nesting, cooking chili, and baking spice cookies that are similar to Russian ones I've been craving but don't have all the ingredients for. Time for dinner! I can only eat a small amount before getting full on account of my stomach being squished. After dinner, my husband suggests watching a Christmas movie to which the answer is always ""Yes!"" We turn on the lights of our tree, have tea and cookies, and watch . It's incredibly cheesy, but that's to be expected. The spice cookies are good but don't totally satisfy my craving. 9 p.m. — We get ready for bed and read parenting books until we fall asleep. I'm currently reading about “using the extraordinary power of less to raise calmer, happier and more secure kids.” Three years ago, we donated about 75% of our possessions using the KonMarie Method and earlier this year, I switched over to a capsule wardrobe. Babies and kids have a tendency to attract a lot of stuff, but we want to stay mindful of what kinds of toys, clothes, etc. we keep for him. My husband is reading a book on meat smoking; he bought a smoker a couple of weeks ago, which I suppose is like his baby until the human gets here. Daily Total: $123",1,94
"5:30 a.m. — The puppy wants to go outside to do her business and my husband has work security training at 6 a.m. I guess it's time for me to get up, too. I eat oatmeal for breakfast and get ready for work. Before leaving for work, I pack a lunch of bread from the farmers' market, cheese and veggies, plus a couple of fruits. My husband has made us coffee so I take mine to go. Before work on weekdays, he drops our dog off at his parents' house so she can play with their two dogs. He heads out around the same time as I do. 10 a.m. — I have a meeting now to discuss and finalize the marketing strategy for an upcoming fundraising event, but I sneak a couple handfuls of popcorn and trail mix into my mouth as my coworker walks in. My coworkers have gotten used to me eating pretty much all day, which is a great perk of pregnancy. 12 p.m. — I get a Facebook message from my husband about a miscommunication with his lunch meeting at work today. Apparently, he's having lunch with his coworker tomorrow instead so now he needs to buy something else to eat. They have a cafeteria at his office so he gets a chicken pico de gallo wrap. $8 5 p.m. — There are only 30 more actual work days left before I head off on maternity leave. With so much to do and not enough time, it feels like a race against the clock. Before I realize it, the day is over and it's time to go home. I stop by the library my dad works at to pick up by Edwin Catmull and Amy Wallace. I'm trying to get in as much reading as I can before our baby arrives. The last time I visited my dad at the library, they had donuts. No such luck tonight. 6 p.m. — As soon as I get home, I put the chili on the stove to heat up and eat a snack of potato chips and hummus until my husband gets home. Then, we have dinner together and take the pup for a walk. I love how excited she gets even if we take the same route every time. 8 p.m. — Time for tea, cookies, and relaxation! I decide this is a good time to look through my baby shower photos and pick the ones I want to print to send with my thank-you cards. Shutterfly wants my email address and they send me a gift of free 50 prints and a sheet of address labels. An hour later, the battery on my laptop is running low and the charger is nowhere to be found. We've been having construction done to our house, including getting a dishwasher installed which will be so helpful with a baby. The problem is that random things have been getting moved or lost. While I lose my mind trying to find my laptop charger, my husband orders me two replacement chargers. I swear pregnancy brain is not to blame for this one! $36 Daily Total: $44",2,94
"6 a.m. — A fun way to wake up is to get punched in the bladder from the inside. I highly recommend everyone try it sometime. On the bright side, the puppy hops into bed for morning cuddles. For breakfast, my husband and I eat cereal. I finish getting ready for work and pack the same bread, cheese, veggie, and fruit lunch as yesterday. A couple of days ago, I used older coffee beans to make a batch of Mexican cold brew coffee (by adding a cinnamon stick to the coffee grounds and water) so we both take a cup of that to go. It tastes amazing and was so easy to make. My husband's company is treating him to lunch today. 10 a.m. — I take a break from work to munch on popcorn and trail mix and finish placing my Shutterfly order. I can't decide between two designs of address labels so I buy both (but only have to pay for one). I also have to pay for shipping. $17 12 p.m. — Someone heated up Italian food in the kitchen and now I really really want pasta. But alas, I shall stick with my own lunch. 4 p.m. — I leave work a little early today because my husband's company is treating everyone and their plus ones to see the new movie together. We both meet up at home then drive to the theater together. I was hoping we could have dinner at a nearby Italian restaurant but we don't have enough time. Chipotle bowls will have to do. $16 9:30 p.m. — On our way back home, the gas light of my car comes on and my husband stops at the station to fill it up for me. The closest one to us is also very expensive so he doesn't fill it up all the way. $30 Daily Total: $63",3,94
"6 a.m. — It's my husband's birthday! He's at the gym so I let our puppy outside and start making oatmeal for breakfast. I wanted to make something more festive, but we don't have the right ingredients. He gets back a couple of minutes after I start making breakfast. We eat breakfast together and I give him his birthday present (a watch I bought from Nordstrom during my 10x points day in early December) to open before we get ready for work. I made sure all of our Christmas shopping was done in late November/early December because I'm a Gemini and don't mess around with Mercury retrograde. 9 a.m. — Once a month, the Champions for Change program has a meeting at our office to discuss ways we can improve the food systems in the low-income neighborhoods we serve so that residents have access to healthy, affordable food options. While it's not required to attend, I sit in on these meetings with my intern because it's something that I'm passionate about. After the meeting, the leader gives out the cookbook with recipes using farmers' market ingredients. A few of the pages that I quickly glance look delicious and I can't wait to try them out. 12:30 p.m. — There is leftover lunch from a departmental meeting and I scan the buffet to see if anything looks appetizing. The dietary restrictions that come with pregnancy can get frustrating, like when lunch is catered and the only options are deli meat sandwiches or salad with blue cheese. I settle on a couple of bread rolls and potato to supplement the leftover chili I brought, which makes for quite the hearty lunch. My husband is getting treated to lunch yet again. Lucky duck! 4:30 p.m. — I leave work and drive to the historic core of downtown to meet my husband and in-laws for his birthday dinner. I have about an hour to kill before our reservation so I decide to stop by The Last Bookstore. Parking is a hassle because I used up all my cash at the farmers' market but I finally find a lot nearby that accepts credit cards. $8 6 p.m. — Resist the urge to buy all the books. I want to buy something to support the bookstore because it's one of the last ones left in the city, but it's too difficult to decide under pressure since my husband will be here at any minute. He's decided to pick me up so I don't have to walk to the restaurant in the dark and the rain. We go to Little Sister, an Asian fusion restaurant. The waitress recommends ordering two dishes per person so we get fried beef meatballs, two types of spring rolls, shaking beef, black rice with seafood, pork confit noodles, and spicy lemongrass fried chicken. She warns us that we've ordered one or two dishes too many but we're planning on eating leftovers for tomorrow anyway. Plus my unborn child counts as a fifth person, right? 8 p.m. — We are stuffed but ready for dessert. Bottega Louie is across the street so we walk over. We order a hazelnut brownie, tiramisu, and a Napoleon for dessert. I sneakily ask the cashier to put a candle on the tiramisu so we can sing ""Happy Birthday."" It was all so delicious and my in-laws generously treated us to both dinner and dessert. Daily Total: $8",4,94
"7 a.m. — It's been cold lately (by L.A. standards) so our dog hasn't wanted to go outside as early. I let her out and make oatmeal for myself and my husband while he prepares breakfast for our dog. We eat in bed with the dog for family cuddle time. (Also because there are covers to keep us warm.) When I get to work, there are chocolate-covered strawberries! The holidays and pregnancy are a pretty good combination because I feel no guilt. 1 p.m. — For lunch, I eat leftovers from dinner last night. Peanut butter cookies have magically appeared on my desk. During my break, I also place a large Amazon order of nursing bras, a birthing ball, an aromatherapy diffuser with essential oils (all of which I plan to pack in my hospital bag), and a baby tub and hamper for the nursery. $205 4 p.m. — After work, I stop by Whole Foods 365 to pick up a rotisserie chicken for dinner and ingredients for the dish I'm making for our office holiday potluck tomorrow. It turns out we need way more random stuff than I anticipated. I end up also buying broth, ground allspice for those Russian spice cookies I've been craving for weeks, cornstarch and bananas (for banana pudding that I've also not been able to stop thinking about), and avocados. The cashier asks me when I'm due and if I know what I'm having. We somehow have a five-minute conversation about gender stereotypes. $77 5:30 p.m. — When I get home from the grocery store, I munch on Trader Joe's white truffle potato chips (which are incredible) while I start making a savory goat cheese, corn and herb pudding for the potluck. I found the recipe in the farmers' market cookbook I got a couple of days ago and wanted to try it out. While shopping, I thought that macerated balsamic berries would be the perfect addition to this dish. It all tastes good to me but my husband tells me not to subject my coworkers to weird pregnancy food combinations. I decide to save the berries to eat at home. While the pudding is cooking, I make Southwestern chicken salad by heating up a can of refried beans from Whole Foods, shredding the rotisserie chicken and adding those, avocado, and harissa salsa, to the top of organic shredded cabbage slaw from Trader Joe's. 8 p.m. — After dinner, we watch while eating a dessert of macerated balsamic berries topped with granola. And by ""watch,"" I mean I fall asleep 20 minutes into the movie while my husband endures a film he had no intention of watching in the first place. Daily Total: $282",5,94
"6 a.m. — Most days, like today, I am in awe of how lucky I am. My husband is making us giant pancakes and coffee while I cuddle in bed with our dog. I love him! We top our pancakes with the berries I made last night and watch while eating breakfast. It's the blind taste test episode in which contestants have to guess what herb or spice they're tasting (with mashed potatoes as a base) while blindfolded. The red team is doing extremely poorly to the point that I scream at the TV that they should get their “chef license” taken away. The irony of judging cooking show contestants from the comfort of my own couch doesn't escape me. 8:15 a.m. — Since it's the Friday before Christmas and we have a half day at work, I am able to show up to the office a little later than usual. I gather my potluck contribution and head out. 11 a.m. — It's time to go to the potluck and I have successfully completed no work today. Everyone is in a very chatty mood. There is so much food and my coworkers keep insisting I cut in front of them in the buffet line because ""the baby needs to eat"" — even when I go back for seconds. I enjoy half a slice of pizza (I split a slice with my coworker), two types of salad, fried chicken, a tamale, potato chips, a chocolate peanut donut and a glass of Martinelli's sparkling cider. After lunch, I get to go home and roll back into bed. 6 p.m. — My parents and brother have come over so we can go to dinner for my husband's birthday together. It's another shared plates type restaurant so we order a ton of food: two types of toast, one with burrata and persimmons and another with taleggio and caramelized onion, farro salad, brussels sprouts, Moroccan-spiced fried chicken and fries, pork and veal braised meatballs, pork cheek ragu with pappardelle and black pepper cavatelli with kabocha squash. To our surprise, we finish everything. The desserts look delicious as well so we order a chocolate hazelnut tart and apple cinnamon cake to-go. This restaurant was quite pricey for only five people so we split the bill with my parents. $118 10 p.m. — My family spends the rest of the night playing Cards Against Humanity, laughing hysterically, and eating dessert with tea. It's such a lovely end to a wonderful day and an even better start to the holiday weekend. Daily Total: $118",6,94
"8 a.m. — I slept surprisingly well last night despite being ridiculously full when I went to bed. I can't decide if I'm hungry yet, but I eat a small bowl of Raisin Bran cereal anyway. It helps to keep things moving along if you know what I mean, and I can use all the help I can get right now in that department. My husband lets our dog out. 8:45 a.m. — Our puppy (who is a white Husky Lab mix) wants to be let back inside but I discover that she has been having way too much fun digging. Her entire face and her legs up to her stomach are covered in mud. On top of that, we have to get ready to go to brunch. We cajole her into the shower and wash her before showering ourselves. By some miracle, we are out of the house in time to make it to our reservation at Redbird in Downtown L.A. Since my husband's birthday is so close to Christmas, we usually do one big activity to celebrate, like kayaking in San Diego or taking a winery tour. Being pregnant doesn't allow for much craziness, so we decided to have a fancy brunch date at a place we've been wanting to try for a very long time. 9:45 a.m. — We make it to the restaurant in record time. The roads are gloriously empty because the L.A. transplants have gone back home for the holidays. The valet is $12 but we find street parking instead. $4 10 a.m. — We walk the half block to the restaurant and are seated right away. I've kept a list of dishes I want to try for at least a month so ordering is a cinch. We get coffee, a brioche donut, biscuits with red-eye rabbit gravy, Basque baked eggs, and a waffle for dessert. The staff was so sweet and put a candle in the waffle for my husband to blow out. $84 11:15 a.m. — After brunch, we stop by Trader Joe's to get groceries for the Christmas dinner we're hosting for our families. My husband has been obsessively researching barbecue recipes and he's excited to take his meat smoker for a spin. We're going to make ribs with a cherry BBQ sauce, baked beans, and mayo-less potato salad with lemon, red onions, and parsley. My mother-in-law is planning to bring a regular salad of some sort and my brother is baking rolls or cornbread. I'll figure out something for dessert tomorrow depending on what I'm craving. For dinner for seven people (and hopefully leftovers), we did pretty good cost-wise. $120 12 p.m. — We've only been gone for two hours but our puppy got so bored while we were away that she tore up all of the mail that was delivered, which appears to have included a holiday card. She looks so proud of herself that we can't even be mad. I spend the next few hours playing with her, putting away laundry, and sorting through my Amazon deliveries. 4 p.m. — My husband and I take our dog for a walk so she doesn't get restless. When we get back, he serves her dinner while I make ours. I make a pasta sauce by cooking down the rest of the organic cabbage slaw and adding rotisserie chicken, tomato sauce, marjoram and thyme. Then I boil some whole wheat penne, pour the sauce on top and sprinkle with Parmesan cheese. I also make garlic toasts with the last few slices of bread from our farmers' market haul earlier in the week. This impromptu dinner turned out much better than expected. The fresh herbs make all the difference. 7 p.m. — After dinner, we play with our puppy outside for a bit. Then I make myself a cup of red raspberry leaf tea and read on the couch with the dog while my husband plays some video games. Alone time is going to be so much more difficult to come by once the baby is here. I use this time to set up a meeting with our doula, research ridiculously expensive childbirth classes, and fill out my 2018 planner with to-do items and due dates. With a baby on the way, I feel like I need to work extra hard to stay on top of everything. My husband joins me on the couch shortly after and we talk about the prenatal class and our first family vacation. I read him the most notable parts of the parenting book while he cuddles my belly. My heart feels so full. Daily Total: $208",7,94
"8 a.m. —Wake up late; it's the weekend! My husband lets me sleep in while he makes coffee and finds cartoons on TV for my son. I jump in the shower, put in my contacts, brush my teeth, and moisturize. (I am trying to be consistent about skincare now that I am in my 40s. My dedication ebbs and flows; right now I am on a good run.) After I throw on my mom uniform (yoga pants, tank, sweater), I drink a cup of coffee while scrolling through my social media apps, make the bed, start a load of laundry, empty the dishwasher, and wake up my daughter. I get her dressed and we eat breakfast together (i.e., I finish my coffee and steal handfuls of her dry Fruit Loops). She also eats a banana and drinks a glass of milk. 10:45 a.m. — My son has soccer at a local park. It's usually earlier in the day, but it's unseasonably cold here so they pushed the start time one hour. I watch him drill and then do a scrimmage for 25 minutes. He doesn't score but he does get two assists; he also shows improvement in stopping the ball and dribbling. I am proud of him! I chat with the other soccer moms and then we play at the playground for a bit. 12 p.m. — We meet my husband and daughter at The Raven Grill, our favorite neighborhood brunch spot. I order a mimosa and a grilled chicken sandwich with olive tapenade. My husband gets a fancy grilled cheese sandwich with an Arnold Palmer, and the kids get a PB&J, chicken strips, milk, and fruit ($66.94). I only eat about half of the chicken so we bring home; I'll give it to the kids as leftovers. We also stop by Picnic, the restaurant's fast-casual bakery and sandwich shop, for three loaves of cranberry-walnut bread ($24). We'll keep one, give one to my dad (who is here for a few months on a temporary assignment), and give one as a hostess gift later this evening. $90.94 1:30 p.m. — It's nap time! I settle in for a few hours of mindless Food Network and HGTV and text with a friend about an upcoming beach trip we are planning with our families. Since having kids, I've found that it's really nice to travel with friends who also have little ones. They entertain each other and there are extra adults who can make keeping an eye on everyone easier. I search potential properties on VRBO and send them to my friend for review. 3:30 p.m. — Nap time is over. I do laundry, clean up, and get ready to go over to our friends' house. I can't wait to see them; the plan is to order in and let the kids hang out for a while. 5 p.m. — With our friends. The kids play well together — there are tons of toys and lots of pets. We order a few pizzas and our friends pay. I deliver the gift and it is well received; they love Picnic bread! 7:30 p.m. — We stop by the wine store on the way home and I get a bottle of Mark West pinot noir. I decide to skip bath time and put the kids to bed. Settle in on the couch to watch the Patriots football game with my husband and drink a glass of wine (or two). $15 11 p.m. — I have been fighting a terrible cold and cough. I feel better but I'm still congested. Going to try to go to bed early. Daily Total: $105.94",1,95
"7 a.m. — I get out of bed and get my son dressed to watch the Houston Marathon. The route goes right through our neighborhood and we are at a mile marker, which means top-40 music and an announcer have been blaring for the last 30 minutes. I make coffee and grab a cereal bar for my son and we head over to the course to cheer on three friends who are running. It's freezing but my kid loves it. We high five the runners and try to yell inspiring words. There is music, police cars flashing sirens to encourage the runners, friendly dogs, and neighbors. Forty-five minutes later, my fingers are numb. My son doesn't want to leave so I bribe him with the promise of hot chocolate and cartoons. 10:30 a.m. — I take my son to a bookstore café. I buy books for him ($55.07) and get a chai latte with almond milk, plain milk for him, and a croissant to share ($9.42). I bring my own paperback, by Liane Moriarty. I've been reading her books since I watched last year. We hang out and read — my favorite way to spend an hour on a Sunday. $64.49 12 p.m. — I like to bake on Sundays, so today I decide to try Alison Roman's salted butter and chocolate chunk shortbread cookies. They are all over the internet and I figure a million Instagram influencers can't be wrong! They are super easy and require only a few ingredients (all of which I have on hand). I place them in the refrigerator to chill. My husband is taking our daughter for a walk, so I play with her and fix lunch until her nap time at 1:30. 12:30 p.m. — I take my son to the grocery store, an expensive one that's always empty. I hate fighting crowds and my favorite, cheaper store is packed on Sundays after 9 a.m. I buy a ton of food including snack food for the kids, potato chips, dip, salsa (football Sunday!), flour, sugar, vegetable oil, red wine vinegar, carrots, peas, bananas, potatoes, avocados, grapes, apples, cauliflower, broccoli, blueberries, milk, sour cream, butter, cheese , yogurt, frozen pizza, frozen hash-browns; fresh tortellini, ground beef, venison sausage, prosciutto, Chik'n nuggets, diapers, and six bottles of wine. (I buy in bulk to get the 10% discount.) I remind myself that this store is way too expensive and promise to wake up early to go to the other store next weekend. I also buy my son M&Ms for being such a good helper. He eats half and says he wants to save the rest for later. I need willpower tips from him! $373.02 1:30 p.m. — I hit the drugstore next and buy three cans of shaving cream for my husband,  Band-Aids, several types of cold medicine for me, and three deodorants. My husband likes to stock up and we usually buy through Amazon, but I am trying to do less of that. $75.54 2 p.m. — Unload groceries and prepare mac and cheese, peas, and a banana for my son. I clean up around the house, start dinner, and bake my cookies. My dad comes over to watch football with my husband and I savor the quiet time while the kids are napping. Where has the day gone? 4 p.m. — Work on preparing dinner for the kids, my husband, and my dad. Tonight, it's turkey meatloaf, mashed potatoes, fresh cauliflower and broccoli, and chocolate chip cookies for dessert. The cookies are amazing. 6 p.m. — Give the kids baths and tuck them in. Can't wait to relax and watch mindless television. 12:30 a.m. — Fell asleep on the couch. I drag myself to the bathroom to brush my teeth and fall into bed. Daily Total: $513.05",2,95
"6 a.m. — Wake up. This is early for me, but I have to be at work no later than 7:45 and my commute is 45 minutes long. I shower, throw my hair in a bun, slap on some makeup, and get dressed. I make coffee at home and hit the road, listening to on my commute. The hosts are hilarious and listening preserves my sanity. 7:45 a.m. — My commute involves a toll road that I think is faster and safer. It's expensive but I think it's worth it to get to work and home without risking an accident. $4 8 a.m. — I am part of a team interviewing for a mass hiring program at my company. I grab tea and meet up with my interview partner to divide our tasks. I am still fighting a cold and cough and hope that if I hydrate, I can get through the interviews without hacking up a lung. 12 p.m. — They provide us with a boxed lunch. We finish our morning interviews late so the only option left is tuna salad sandwich on a croissant. This is totally unappealing but I am starving. I eat the tuna salad (avoiding the limp croissant), chips, and a cookie. I have a diet Dr. Pepper, which is also gross. The only other option is Pepsi products, which I do not like, so I skip. I grab a bottled water and get ready for the next round of interviews. 4 p.m. — We are finished with the interviews. I catch up on emails and phone calls and then head out around 5:15. It's MLK Jr. Day, so traffic is fortunately light. 6 p.m. — I arrive home and my husband is already feeding the kids dinner — Newman's Own cheese pizza, roasted carrots, and fruit. He is a rockstar. I am so lucky to have such an amazing partner. I sit with the kids through dinner, eat pizza, and drink a glass of wine. I play with the kids for a bit and then help with baths, stories, and bedtime. 9 p.m. — The kids are in bed. I log back onto my work computer for an hour or so to answer emails I couldn't get to during the day. My husband and I hang out and chat until it's time for bed. I am still feeling under the weather and hope that if I get to bed early, I'll start feeling healthy. The weather service is predicting icy rain tomorrow (a non-starter in Houston) so there is a high likelihood the kids' daycare will be closed. I prepare myself for a day of trying to entertain them while working from home. 11 p.m. — My attempts to go to sleep early are thwarted by a group text from two of my good friends. There is major gossip and despite my best efforts to get a good night's sleep, I am sucked in for 45 minutes. Finally, brush my teeth and fall asleep. Daily Total: $4",3,95
"5 a.m. — I wake up and learn that daycare and work are closed due to heavy ice. Houston and ice are a very dangerous combination. I log on to my computer, answer some emails, and have a cup of coffee. The kids get up around 7 a.m. and we feed them breakfast, get them settled with cartoons and toys, and try to work remotely. We also call our housekeeper; she comes once a week and I do not want her to have travel in this weather. We reschedule for Friday. This means I need to start the kids' laundry; my son is on his last pair of pants. 9 a.m. — My son needs new shoes. I go to Amazon and present him with two options; he chooses the cheaper ones! I also throw in a few of pairs of fuzzy socks for myself. (I normally would randomly order a pair of socks, but I love them. Especially during this cold snap.) The purchase is $70.89, but we have an Amazon credit card, so I am able to pay with points. I continue to answer work emails and keep the news on in the background. The highways are very icy and the mayor is asking everyone to stay off the roads. I hope it's better tomorrow but it is doesn't look like it will be at the moment. 12 p.m. — Make lunch for the kids and nibble on salami and crackers for me. 1 p.m. — Take several conference calls and try to cram as much work in as possible during my kids' nap time. I also log on to the Harris County Toll Authority website to pay a toll I missed last week. (I was driving my husband's car and he does not have an E-ZPass.) It's $3.25 ($1.50 + a $1.75 surcharge); so that this does not happen again, I sign him up for an E-ZPass and put $40 in the account. They'll send us the pass in the mail. We've been in Houston for almost 10 years; it's time! $43.25 5 p.m. — For dinner, my husband made a meat sauce with pasta and roasted carrots. It was delicious but I am exhausted and overwhelmed. I give the kids a bath and then we have an impromptu dance party in the living room when my son asks Alexa to play one of his favorite songs. It's awesome to blow off some steam and the kids have a blast. 11 p.m. — I go to bed. Everything is closed again tomorrow and I am dreading trying to work and manage my kids who, understandably, are suffering from major cabin fever. Finger's crossed that I make it. I have always respected moms who stay at home with their kids (read: work at home!), but that respect grows immeasurably when I have to do it myself. Reminder to be less grumpy at work... Daily Total: $43.25",4,95
"7:30 a.m. — We are still iced in. I'm dreading trying to work and watching the kids at the same time. 12 p.m. — Make lunch for the kids, counting down the minutes until nap time. I've been trying to field work calls and emails while simultaneously entertaining the kids. I hope I can squeeze in a few hours of productive work during nap time while the kids are asleep. I also secure a babysitter for Friday night. We have an event related to my husband's job and I do not want to have to cancel. Proud of myself for being proactive! 5:30 p.m. — Our nanny is available to help out. We pay her $20 per hour and she is amazing. She takes the kids outside and my husband makes hotdogs and peas for the kids. We eat dinner, play, and have bath time. Nanny stays for two hours and helps us through dinner and baths; she's a lifesaver. I handle stories and teeth brushing for my daughter. My husband does the same for my son. We somehow get everyone into bed before 8 p.m., but my son's not asleep and I fear he'll resist bedtime. $40 9:00 p.m. — Kids are finally asleep. I text with a friend who's a foodie, trying to decide on a restaurant to celebrate my dad's 75th birthday in a few weeks. I settle on a super-fancy Italian place that has rave reviews. I peruse the dessert menu and see cannoli, one of my favorites. I am sold! I book the reservation. I must remember to get a babysitter! Daily Total: $40",5,95
"6:30 a.m. — I wake up, shower, and dress, then wake up the kids, get them dressed, put bananas in their backpacks, and leave to drop them off at daycare. I help them get breakfast from the school buffet; the school charges $1 per child for breakfast. Everyone is settled and I am relieved that life is getting back to normal. $2 7:30 a.m. — I need to get hardwood floor cleaner for my housekeeper. I purchase the cleaning supplies, she cleans the house, and when she runs out of something, she leaves me a note. I figure the stores will empty this time of day and I can knock it out quickly. I purchase the floor cleaner and also pick up a few essentials: bananas, yogurt, yogurt smoothies, salami, tortilla chips, cover up for a pimple on my chin, a loaf of bread, and fruit and croissants to share with my colleagues. I race home to drop off the groceries and head to work. $50.30 8:55 a.m. — Take the toll road to get to work. The roads are filled with sand to combat the ice and a rock flies up and hits my windshield, leaving a crack. Argh. I'll have to try to find a glass repair place this weekend. Arrive at the office, very glad to be back in my routine. We have a cleanup day scheduled, so in between phone calls and emails, I sort through my files and decide what to recycle and what to keep. I munch on a croissant for breakfast. $4 11:30 a.m. — My boss orders in Chick-fil-A as a reward for our cleanup day. I wolf down two chicken strips, a lemonade, and fruit before going to a meeting at another site. 3:30 p.m. — My meeting is over and I have approximately 30 minutes before my next round of conference calls. I chat with some of my clients and get a craving for chips, so I go down to the convenience store on the first floor of the building and buy Ruffles chips and a water. At least I avoided soda! $3.32 7:30 p.m. — I wrap up my work and go home. I do not usually work this late but this week has been crazy and I needed quiet time to do deep-thinking work. I take the toll road again and call my husband on the way. Our nanny is there helping with the kids and my dad has stopped over for dinner. We agree to order Chinese food and we will have dinner when I get home. $4 8:20 p.m. — I put my son to bed (he's still up) and then join my dad and husband for dinner. We share crab puffs, steamed dumplings, General Tso's chicken, beef with asparagus, and rice. My dad and I open a bottle of sauvignon blanc and my husband has a beer. $52.73 (including tip) 9:30 p.m. — Half of my Amazon purchase has arrived; my fuzzy socks are here! I call my brother, we chat for a while, and I go to bed. I have a super early day tomorrow. Daily Total: $116.35",6,95
"6 a.m. — I wake up early because I have an 8 a.m. conference call and I have to get myself ready, help my husband with the kids, and be out the door by 7 a.m. if I am going to be on time. We have a jeans day today, so at least that part is easy. I also wear my favorite boots, a sweater, and a scarf; it's still freezing here. Everyone is dressed, show-and-tell items are selected, and I toss bananas in the kids' bags. I grab a Diet Coke to drink on the road. I don't have time to make coffee and I need the caffeine. 7 a.m. — I'm on the road and I take the toll road again. I listen to with Preet Bharara, one of my favorite podcasts. He's the former U.S. Attorney from the Southern District of New York and always has an interesting take on current events. Today, he's interviewing the producer of a new Netflix series about corporate white-collar crime. I'll Google it when I get home; it sounds like something I would love to watch. $4 7:40 a.m. — Arrive at the office and spend the next two hours on teleconferences. 10 a.m. — I have another meeting at 10:30 but I am feeling sluggish, so I decide to run down to the Starbucks in my building and get a chai latte. I usually get regular milk but given my lactose issues, I ask for almond milk instead. I did not mind it when I tried it last weekend but when I go back to my desk and taste it, it's disgusting. I try a few more sips and still hate it. It must be the brand of almond milk. I toss it and head to my next meeting. $5.10 12 p.m. — My coworker asks if I want to eat lunch. I have yet another meeting at 1 and I should stay at my desk to answer some emails, but I decide I need a break and we agree to meet in the lounge area in 10 minutes. I run back down to the Starbucks and order a breakfast sandwich and a Diet Coke. (I realize I have a problem.) I love breakfast anytime of day! When I get to our lunch spot, I discover that the barista gave me two sandwiches. So nice. I probably should not eat both of them, but I do. Yummy, but I feel a little ill. $6.45 5:15 p.m. — Leave the office. My husband and I have a party with his coworkers tonight and I want to get home and help him get the kids fed and ready for bed. I listen to the news on the way home because I am interested in whether the pundits think the government is going to shut down; Congress has until midnight tonight. I take the toll road. It's raining and traffic is terrible, and I do not get home until 6:30. $4 7 p.m. — I get the kids settled in front of , their current favorite. I like the movie but at this point, the music is making me crazy. The babysitter arrives, I attempt to make myself look cute, and we head out the door. The party is fun, complete with a jazz band and delicious desserts. We mingle and before we know it, it's almost 10 o'clock. We head home and pay the babysitter for three hours of work. $60 10:15 p.m. — My BFF calls. She lives on the West Coast and also has a small kid, so we have to coordinate if we're going to chat. (Sometimes I want to actually talk instead of text — Gen X.) She tells me about a job she is thinking of applying for and I give her the lowdown on my week. I miss her so much. We sign off and I watch the countdown to the government shutting down. We're on Central Time, so at 11 here, it's midnight in D.C. and Congress couldn't get it done. I decide to go to bed. This week was crazy exhausting but we made it! Daily Total: $79.55",7,95
"6:40 a.m. — C. and I spent the weekend at his brother's farm upstate so we get up early to catch the train into the city. We're toast after spending a full Sunday doing manual labor on the farm. C.'s brother drives us to the train station, and we buy tickets on the mobile app. $18.50 9:45 a.m. — Finally off the train. It takes a transfer in Jersey and a subway ride to get to my office, and it's Monday morning rush hour. Woof. I decide I need a bacon, egg, and cheese sandwich to survive the morning. I order it on an everything bagel and fork over my money. The only bodega in my work hood closed so now, I have to rely on a bougie bagel place for my BEC fix. $8.11 10 a.m. — Get to the office and pour a cup of coffee with cream. I have a bite of the coffee cake sitting on the counter and eat my BEC with hot sauce at my desk. C. texts to tell me he's stopping for a sausage, egg, and cheese. Snap him a picture of my BEC and tell him great minds think alike. 1 p.m. — I'm not very hungry but I know the afternoon will get away from me if I don't grab something now. Head to a local joint that has good/healthy food. It seems pricey but I can save half for a second meal. I get braised Mediterranean chicken over sweet potato mash and a side of kale-avocado-bean salad and cauliflower. $11.38 1:30 p.m. — Ugh. Cauliflower tastes like sulfur. I've never loved it, but I always hope I'll grow out of not liking it. Wrong again. 2 p.m. — A coworker is going to a fundraiser to benefit victims of Hurricane Maria. I want to contribute, so I Venmo him $20. I have a stockpile of cash in my Venmo account from various birthday gifts and from covering friends, so it feels like Monopoly money to me. $20 3:30 p.m. — I'm bored, and this afternoon has been so unproductive. I cut up an apple from the office pantry and drink some water. I'm so sore from the farm work yesterday! 5:10 p.m. — I practically run out of the office. I'm so excited to get home. I veg on the couch for a while with a seltzer and my book. 7 p.m. — C. and I watch (our weeknight tradition) and make dinner. He went to the store earlier and got flank steak, greens, and artichokes. We eat an amazing dinner and binge watch the second season of . I'm asleep before I hit the pillow around 10:30. Daily Total: $57.99",1,96
"7:20 a.m. — My alarm goes off and I'm not ready to get out of bed. I take a quick shower and head into the city on the subway. 8:45 a.m. — Stop by the coffee shop and get an iced skim latte and a zucchini peach muffin. I have a site visit at my company's future office, so I put my breakfast on the company card. ($7.45 expensed) 10:15 a.m. — The site visit is over, and I'm really excited about the new office. There's lots of marble and swanky light fixtures — definitely an upgrade from our current space. I walk 15 minutes uptown to the old office. 12 p.m. — My company is doing an online promo to stress-test our website. They're offering 50% off three items for all employees (we usually only get 25% discounts). I buy C. a new pair of Nikes, a Patagonia jacket for him for Christmas, and I get myself a pair of Vans. $129 1:30 p.m. — Heat up my leftover lunch from yesterday and wolf it down at my desk while reading. 2:30 p.m. — Second lunch! C. packed me the rest of the flank steak from last night plus greens and dressing so I toss it all together in a big bowl that I keep at my desk. 3:45 p.m. — Spent the last hour browsing dresses on Rent the Runway for a gala C. and I are going to next month. I love dressing up, but I don't own anything fancy, and I want to go big for my first gala. I find an amazing Badgley Mischka dress that retails for $660 and is only $115 to rent before shipping, insurance, and tax. My work bestie sends me a $30 discount since it's my first time using RtR, so I apply that and order the dress. $108.34 5:20 p.m. — Leave the office and take the subway home. The trains are a nightmare, and I come home in a major funk to a sunburned and hangry C. I drink a seltzer on the couch and fume while he complains about work. 7 p.m. — We watch C. makes a sausage and Swiss chard pasta, and I make a salad. We manage to snap out of our funk and watch an episode of followed by an episode of with chocolate peanut butter ice cream. Hit the hay at 11. Daily Total: $237.34",2,96
"7:30 a.m. — Alarm goes off and I stare at my phone in bed for 30 minutes. I forego a shower and head out the door. It's humid, and the whole way in, I feel like I'm going to die on the subway. 9 a.m. — Pour myself an office coffee and cut up a banana over oatmeal. This is my normal work breakfast, but I've been bad the last couple of days with BECs and muffins. 12 p.m. — My office has a town hall meeting today and lunch from Le Pain Quotidien is provided. I take a half ham-and-cheese and a half turkey club sandwich plus arugula salad, a cookie, and a strawberry. 2:30 p.m. — Nibble on a few sour gummy worms that I have stashed under my desk for mid-afternoon sweet tooth emergencies. 3 p.m. — Walk to the coffee shop with a colleague for our weekly 1:1. We each get iced tea. ($4 expensed) 5:30 p.m. — Head out of the office for a long walk home. I need to call my parents to catch up, and I like doing that while I'm on a walk. I call my mom and trek the 4.5 miles over the Brooklyn Bridge and to my apartment. 7 p.m. — Home just in time for . I watch with my roommate and then heat up leftover sausage and chard pasta. C. is at a work dinner and won't be home 'til later. 10 p.m. — Spent the last couple of hours reading and staring at engagement rings on the internet. C. gets home, and we giggle and talk for an hour and a half before passing out. Daily Total: $0",3,96
"7:40 a.m. — Alarm goes off, and I'm up, showered, and out the door. 9 a.m. — Coffee and banana over oatmeal from the work pantry. 12:15 p.m. — Walk to my go-to healthy lunch spot, and order a small kale, black bean, and avocado salad with sweet potato mash and salmon on top; it's delicious. $10.89 3 p.m. — Find an almost ripe peach in the office pantry and eat it at my desk. 5:15 p.m. — My afternoon was uneventful at work, but my office has a happy hour down the street. I stroll over with a couple colleagues and order a beer. ($7 expensed) 6:30 p.m. — I'm on my way to meet C. and some of his friends for dinner and drinks in Brooklyn. When I get there, C. has a beer waiting for me. We order four tacos, and I pay since C. offers to get my beers for the night. $18 10:30 p.m. — We have a good time and a few more beers, and at the end of the night we hail a cab for the mile to our apartment. C. tells me he'll pay if I buy him a slice of pizza. We stop at the pizza place right under our apartment and order a cheese slice for C. and a pepperoni slice for me and stumble upstairs to bed. $6.50 Daily Total: $35.39",4,96
"8 a.m. — TGIF, but oh man, I'm hungover. Three and a half beers never made a dent in me before; I am clearly getting old. I have a meeting with my financial advisor at 10, and my boss knows I'll be in late. I get dressed, eat a bowl of cereal, and head out by 9 to go uptown. 10 a.m. — My financial advisor is so nice. I order a giant coffee, and we go over my investments. We're moving money around and transferring $11,000 into a mutual fund, and starting in mid-October, I'll be contributing $1,050/month into various investment funds. We agree that I can decrease my 401(k) contributions to 10% of my paycheck and still max out on my employer match, while keeping my discretionary funds comfortable. 11:15 a.m. — Back at the office and there are donuts on the counter. I cut a jelly donut in half and proceed to inhale it. 12:45 p.m. — My colleague asks if I want to grab lunch, so we go to our favorite cute café and decide to sit outside since it's so beautiful. I order a steak salad with blue cheese, onions, strawberries, hazelnuts, and snap peas, and it's so freaking good. ($24 expensed) 3 p.m. — Snack on sour gummy worms from my desk stash and decrease my 401(k) contributions to 10% per my financial advisor's instructions. 5 p.m. — Eat a pot sticker and a scallion pancake from the office before I head home. It's finally the weekend! 6 p.m. — The jacket and shoes I bought earlier in the week arrived! C. loves his shoes and jacket, but I'm not really excited about my Vans; they're very white. I'm not sure if I'll keep them for next summer or send them back for a $30 refund. 7:30 p.m. — C. and I each drink a beer, and he suggests we hang out on the couch and order delivery for dinner. We've been dating for almost a year and a half, and we've literally never done this before. We decide on our favorite Szechuan place and order spicy marinated cucumbers, spicy pork wontons, and double-cooked chicken. I pay and tell C. he can get groceries tomorrow. We chill on the couch for the rest of the evening. $37.50 Daily Total: $37.50",5,96
"11:30 a.m. — We slept in until 9 a.m., and C. makes coffee for us to drink in bed with our books. I finally get hungry, so we scramble eggs with sausage and eat that with toast and potatoes. 2 p.m. — We shower and kick around the idea of grabbing a beer in the neighborhood, but instead we head to the grocery store. We get chicken breasts, carrots, onions, mustard, toilet paper, Kleenex, sponges, crackers, brie, and greens. C. pays since I got dinner last night. 3 p.m. — C. sears the chicken and gets it going on the stove in a pot with water, carrots, onion, and garlic. I make a quick dough in the food processor and put it in the fridge to chill. We put together the leftovers of dinner from last night for a late lunch, then drink beers with cheese and crackers. 6 p.m. — A friend stops by for a drink, and C. and I split a beer while I de-seed a pomegranate. After our friend leaves, we shred the chicken and make filling for a chicken pot pie. I roll out the dough and we pop it in the oven. While it's baking, C. makes chicken salad with the leftover chicken for lunches next week, and a green salad to go with our chicken pot pie. I top the green salad and the chicken salad with pomegranate seeds. 9 p.m. — C. has a sweet tooth, so he makes a quick peanut butter fudge with butter, sugar, vanilla, and peanut butter. After it chills in the fridge for an hour, I eat a small piece and then head to bed. Daily Total: $0",6,96
"6:40 a.m. — Ugh. We're up so early for a Sunday because we're going back to C.'s brother's winery to help harvest grapes. C. puts coffee for us in thermoses and buys yogurts and an apple for the road from the bodega downstairs. Our friends pick us up in their car. 9:30 a.m. — We're finally at the vineyard, where we pick grapes all day. It's backbreaking and C. and I stop midway down our row of vines to share a donut and drink seltzer. 5 p.m. — We're finally finished and leaving the vineyard. I wanted to head back to the city by 5 p.m. to avoid Sunday traffic, but it looks like that isn't happening. We get to C.'s brother's farm where he's made a feast for everyone who helped with the harvest. We drink lots of good wine and eat sausages, cheese, bread, and tons of fresh veggies from the farm, plus the rest of C.'s fudge from last night. 10:30 p.m. — I can't believe we left so late. Of course we hit traffic, and it takes us over three hours to get home. I shower and crawl into bed extremely cranky and unenthused to end my weekend this way. Daily Total: $0",7,96
"7:15 a.m. — Stop for gas on my way to work. I knew I should've gone over the weekend, but I really hate doing so for some reason. (I tend to ride it out until I'm genuinely afraid my car will die.) Ideally, I'd drive a more fuel-efficient vehicle, but I love my SUV and all the space. Our dogs fit comfortably, and once we have kids, it'll fit the whole family. Plus, once the Model 3 is available, we're getting one for my husband, and that will ease my gas mileage guilt. $42.67 9:45 a.m. — H-E-B offers curbside pickup for groceries and it is amazing. I go online to their website and order our groceries for the week. They charge more than in-store prices, but since it keeps me from impulse shopping, I've saved quite a bit in the long run. I pick out chicken, shrimp, ground turkey, mushrooms, romaine, tortillas, 2% cheese, waffles, Lunchables, enchilada sauce, buffalo sauce, other produce, wine (DUH), paper plates, new Holiday glade plug-in refills, and Skinny Cow ice cream. I pay for everything and I'll pick it up on my way home. $97.25 11 a.m. — Lunchtime! Everyone in my department goes to lunch at 11 a.m., something that took getting used to when I started this job in June. Now I can't imagine eating any later and at 10:55 — my tummy is growling. I walk the quarter-mile from my building to the onsite cafeteria and browse through the choices. It's underwhelming, so I opt for the deli line. I get a turkey-chicken wrap with avocado, baked Lays, and a bottle of water. Lunch is expensed because my company deposits $30/month onto our badges for use in the cafeteria; they also match the $30 I contribute, so I end up with $90/month for only $30; it's a great deal. It's almost the end of the month, so I have about $22 left. Only one more day and I'll get another $30, so I'm not worried. ($4.75 expensed) 2:15 p.m. — I should learn that when I get the deli line food, I always end up hungry in the afternoon. If it weren't such a long walk, I'd go pick up fruit or a healthier snack, but that walk is brutal and it's unnecessarily hot and humid today, so vending machine it is! I get Goldfish crackers and eat them at my desk while I browse the internet. $0.75 2:45 p.m. — I love my job and the people I work with but to be honest, I could do my job in 20 hours a week or less. I've expressed this to my boss and he's working on getting me more to do. Until then, I spend the majority of my day browsing the internet and getting paid good money to do it; could be worse! I end up on Wish, a shopping site that's my weakness. Everything is so cheap and I've always liked what I've ordered. My sister-in-law's birthday is the day before Thanksgiving and she has wanted studded-heel booties for a while; I find the pair she likes for half the normal price and add them to the cart along with cute kitchen gadgets I can put in my mom's stocking. I also add a sweet necklace for my husband's grandmother and a necklace for my sister-in-law. I enjoy buying Christmas gifts early! Makes me feel ahead of the game. $36.75 3:15 p.m. — We are hosting our first Thanksgiving this year and I am determined to make it beautiful. My best friends are flying down from Dallas (yes flying — that drive is literally the worst) and that has increased our guest count to 10. I only have eight cute napkins and napkin rings, so I go to Target.com and order one more set of each. I also decide to order cute wifey and hubby coffee mugs because I'm a newlywed and am a sucker for all things husband/wife. I browse all their holiday collections but decide to wait and go in person with my husband. $47.50 5:30 p.m. — Made it to H-E-B and they had to substitute a few items, but luckily the price difference was super minimal. They load everything in my car and I head home. I'm greeted by my sweet husband and our two adorable dogs. I pour a glass of wine and sit on our patio while they run around and play. I turn on the grill because tonight we're eating grilled buffalo chicken sandwiches. My husband brings everything out so I can keep playing with the pups. They're both rescue dogs and are truly the light of my life. Anything I can do to make them happy fills my heart with so much joy. Of course, this means they get some of the cheese I'm putting on the chicken. Spoiled doggos. $1.72 9:15 p.m. — As we get ready for bed, my husband mentions that he wishes he had more bandanas for work. He only has two and he hates wearing them multiple days in a row. His job is all manual labor and the bandana helps keep him warm when it's cold as well as helping collect sweat in his hard hat. I tell him to order some but he reminds me that I'm the one with the Amazon Prime info, so I hand him my phone and places the order. We combined our finances long before we were married. I have always made more money than him, but I also spend significantly more money than he does, so it has never bothered me to combine things. I sometimes feel guilty because he ALWAYS asks before he buys things and I never do. I don't know if that'll become a point of contention once we are out of the honeymoon phase. Time will tell. $15.42 Daily Total: $242.06",1,97
"7:30 a.m. — On my way to work and running a little late so I take the toll route. I'm trying to cut back on how much I pay the toll, but it makes a huge difference in time. I also am always okay taking the toll when my husband and I carpool. We aren't carpooling today though because it's HALLOWEEN! Trick-or-treating starts at 5:30 p.m. in our neighborhood. I won't be home by then, but I wanted my husband to get back in time to start handing out candy. It's our first Halloween with trick-or-treaters and we are so excited! $2.77 11 a.m. — Lunchtime. It's Taco Cantina Tuesday: two tacos, rice, and beans. I look forward to Tuesday lunch every week! I still have money on my badge, so it doesn't cost me anything. 2:30 p.m. — I walk to the cafeteria and pick up a little container of fruit (also covered by my badge). I proceed to walk around the site and eat my fruit. It's kind of cold and drizzly, but I'm wearing the right jacket and it doesn't bother me. 5:55 p.m. — My husband calls and tells me about the groups of trick-or-treaters coming down our street, and that a house on our cul-de-sac turned into a haunted house. He also says he was a little heavy-handed with the first few groups and we will need more candy. I stop at Walgreens and pick up two more big bags. I get Reese's because that's what I would want and I fully intend to enjoy some. I also pick up a bottle of red wine because all I got from H-E-B yesterday was white wine and it's chilly out. $27.40 9:30 p.m. — We blew through five large bags of candy tonight and still had to turn our porch light out early. It was so much fun. We sat in our front room and played Jenga, drank red wine, and passing out candy. Our dogs were less than pleased that they couldn't give kisses to every little kid, but they managed to get a few in. We enjoy a few pieces of candy and head to bed. Daily Total: $30.17",2,97
"7:25 a.m. — Taking the toll today because we are carpooling. I enjoy riding to work with my husband because it gives us a chance to chat and hold hands. I always drive so I'm a little distracted, but it's still nice to start my day with my hand in his. $2.77 11 a.m. — I always go to lunch at 11 on the dot. If I could go at 10:55 to beat the rush, I would — but that seems a little too eager. It's the first of the month so I put $30 on my card. I get in the pizza line, which is notoriously long and slow, but the pizza is good and worth the wait. Twenty-five minutes later, I'm sitting down for lunch. My department always has two to four tables pushed together and we eat as a group. It's such a nice change from my last job where I would eat alone at my desk. $30 5:25 p.m. — The day flew by because I had an afternoon full of meetings. I wasn't able to do any internet shopping, so that's for the best! On our way home, we decide to go to a game shop and pick up Reaper Minis, little game figurines that are typically unpainted. I'm not going to use them, but I'll enjoy painting them with my husband. He plans to use them for when he plays Dungeons & Dragons. He's a gamer and I'm not, but we find small ways to do things together and painting little warriors sounds fun. We will order the paints on Amazon tonight. $26.40 7:30 p.m. — We sit down for dinner and look through Amazon to find the right paint set and place the order. After, we curl up on the couch and watch . We totally missed the bandwagon on this show but decided to start watching it and now we can't stop! We watch two episodes before bed. Lights out before 10. $37.61 Daily Total: $96.78",3,97
"7:30 a.m. — Not carpooling today, so I stop to get Starbucks! Venti iced soy chai it is. My husband calls while I'm driving to work and we chat about the episodes we watched last night and exchange theories about what we think will happen. $5.52 10:30 a.m. — A friend of ours works at a local restaurant and messages me about a wine night event they're having. She isn't working that day and wants to see if my husband and I want to join her and her boyfriend. Tickets are $30 each and include snacks and wine. She sends me the link so I can buy our tickets. These friends are our only ""couple"" friends and we really enjoy hanging out with them. I'm looking forward to this next week! $60 11 a.m. — Thursday is build your own pasta day, but I'm not feeling it. I opt for a salad and a big cup of soup. The total is less than $5 and I'm very pleased with my choice. I sit with coworkers who are mostly talking about work today. I'm an admin for a department of engineers and do not have much to contribute. I have no clue about what their jobs entail, but I'm trying to learn so I can help them more. 4:05 p.m. — My husband sends me a message with a link to a Christmas tree for sale on Facebook Marketplace. Our house has vaulted ceilings and I told him how much I wanted a tall Christmas tree this year. I also mentioned how bummed I was that they're all so expensive. The link he sent is to a 12-foot tree for only $225! I'm sold and so excited. It's a great price and will look stunning in our front room. We plan to put our old, dinky, five-foot tree in our den. Two Christmas trees to decorate; I can hardly contain my excitement. I tell him how happy I am and thank him for even looking. I message the seller and agree on the price. We will pick it up Saturday morning. I go to the ATM onsite and get the cash. I'm glad USAA reimburses ATM fees otherwise I'd be annoyed by the $3 fee they charge. $225 5:30 p.m. — We both enjoyed that red wine from Halloween so much that I stop and pick up another bottle; we're watching more tonight. When I get home, I dance around the front room daydreaming about the huge tree that will be here soon. I start to wonder if it would be weird to have it up for Thanksgiving. My husband says yes, but that we can put it up the day after our Thanksgiving feast. I agree and cry a few happy tears. My husband is an incredible person who appreciates my childlike joy around Christmas. $10.07 10:15 p.m. — We are about to shower when I notice we are almost out of soap. I tell Alexa to order more. We buy it in mega-bulk so, this will last at least six months. Technology is amazing. $15.12 Daily Total: $315.71",4,97
"8 a.m. — TGIF! I forgot my waffles at home, so I walk over to the cafeteria. I'm not feeling the greasy breakfast tacos, so I get mixed fruit and a Cherry Coke Zero. It's back to being overly hot for November and I'm annoyed that I'm sweating when I get back to my desk. Really glad I went for the fruit. 11 a.m. — A coworker asks if I wanted to go offsite with her today for and I accept. I rarely do this, so I don't feel bad about spending the money. We go to Freebirds, get nachos, and catch up on the latest work gossip and discuss upcoming office moves. It's going to be very stressful for us both, but I'm looking forward to having new office furniture. She's looking forward to moving to the main building because they have WAY better bathrooms. (Unfortunately, I'll still have our old, outdated bathrooms with terrible AC.) $8.75 3:45 p.m. — I've been pretty busy until now. With absolutely nothing to do, I proceed to browse all of the internet. I wish this were the kind of job I could leave early from on Fridays but this it isn't. I miss the schedule of my last job — and literally nothing else. 6:30 p.m. — It's Friday and I don't feel like cooking dinner. I convince my husband to get Mexican food and margaritas. We head to our favorite place and get seated right away (part of why it's our favorite). We share queso, I get a fajita melt, and he orders chimichangas. We both get two margaritas. It's pricey, but we don't eat out much and really enjoy margarita date nights. $87 8:30 p.m. — We get home and contemplate watching , but the tequila makes us feel indifferent about sitting around and watching TV. Instead, we play with our dogs, sit outside laughing, and have a good time. We eventually go upstairs and finally go to sleep around 11 p.m. Daily Total: $95.75",5,97
"9:30 a.m. — It's Saturday! I wake up after more than 10 hours of sleep and I feel awesome. I throw on comfy clothes and head to my mom's, stopping at H-E-B and pick up bagels and smoked salmon. My mom lives about 20 minutes away and it's great to be able to spend time with her so regularly since we are close. Today, we plan on sitting on her new couch and working on the Thanksgiving menu. She's a great cook and I appreciate any guidance she can offer. $9.75 2:45 p.m. — After spending the morning planning Thanksgiving, I take a nap at my mom's. I wake up a little before 3 and decide to go home. 6 p.m. — My husband convinces me to order pizza for dinner and Dominos is on the way. We start another episode of while we wait for our food to arrive. I pour a glass of wine, finish it a little too quickly, and throw caution to the wind and pour another. When the pizza arrives, I give them a $5 tip. We chow down, snuggle up, and binge watch until I can't keep my eyes open anymore. Lights out around 11:30 p.m. $32.15 Daily Total: $41.90",6,97
"8:30 a.m. — Wide awake and getting ready for brunch with my best friend. We never get to do this because she always works on Sundays, but she's off today. I'm so excited to catch up with her. 11:30 a.m. — We opt for a bottomless mimosa brunch buffet since we plan on being here for a while and getting our fill. She knows several people who work here, so no one will mind that we plan on holding this table for at least three hours. When it's finally time to head out, I pay for both of our meals and drinks. She's been going through rough times and I'm happy to cover it. $65 3:30 p.m. — My husband calls to ask when I'm coming home. He woke up with allergies from hell and could use tissues and meds. I tell him I'm coming home now and will stop at Walgreens. Poor guy! Allergy season in Austin is terrible. So, I get him the good Puffs (with lotion), allergy meds, and his favorite candy (Sour Patch Kids). $12.15 5:30 p.m. — Husband is feeling better and we decide to take our dogs for a walk. We lived in apartments for so long and now that we are in a house with a huge backyard, we forget how much our dogs love going for walks. We touch their leashes and they cannot contain their excitement. We walk through the neighborhood for about 45 minutes and talk about our plans for Thanksgiving and Christmas. Our family is local and we have family in the DFW area also. I hate the drive up, but he thinks it's silly to fly. I suggest that he drive and he changes his tune! He to look at flights after I explain I have plenty of miles to cover it. 7 p.m. — We are looking for flights and realize there are no good times to book with miles and the prices are steep, but it'll so much less stressful that we book it anyway. I didn't even realize we could get a flight home on Christmas Eve at 7 p.m. Now I'm trying to of ways to share the holiday spirit with the flight crew working that day. I'm also grateful for our friends in the DFW who are letting us borrow a car during our short 24 hours there. $530.48 9:30 p.m. — I say it's bedtime and my husband gets grumpy because he REALLY wants to watch one more episode. I remind him that tomorrow is Monday and we both sigh and discuss how much we wish we could just be stay-at-home dog parents. That's the dream! Daily Total: $607.63",7,97
"11 a.m. — I wake up and I realize I am in A.'s bed. A. is a guy I am dating and last night we made dinner and watched until about 3 a.m. (More truthfully, he cooked dinner while I drank wine, and he watched while I fell asleep on top of him.) We wake up and he makes us coffee, and we sit on his back porch admiring the fall weather while we drink. 12 p.m. — A. and I decide to enjoy the sunshine, so we take his roommate's dog on a walk. We walk all the way around Sloan's Lake and then some. By the time we get back to his house, we realize we have been walking for two hours! 3 p.m. — Neither of us has eaten today and we are starving. It's the Great American Beer Festival this weekend in Denver, which means every brewery in the city is running specials and all the diehard craft beer drinkers are going nuts. (A. is one of them; I am not.) We decide to ride bikes into downtown and hit up a few local breweries. (A. is big into riding bikes... I am not.) He is cute enough that I will learn to (or at least pretend) to like these things. 4:15 p.m. — First stop is FreshCraft and it is crackin'. Denver has a massive craft beer culture to begin with, but GABF week takes it to a whole new level. We each get a beer — don't ask me what kind — and split an order of wings, chicharrones, and an Italian beef sandwich. We split the tab. $24 5:30 p.m. — We decide to walk the few blocks to Falling Rock Tap House, which is even crazier than FreshCraft. I get whatever beer A. recommends, and he picks up this round. We head to the basement and play free pool for a few hours. I cover our second round. Craft beer, especially these fancy ones being tapped this week, are insanely expensive! $21 8 p.m. — I'm realizing now that the sun has set and we have to ride the four miles home in the dark! We walk back to where we locked up the bikes and begin the journey. A. teases me about not knowing how to use the gears on a mountain bike because I only ride stationary bikes (spinning). Once we get back to his place, we feed the dog and catch the end of the Michigan/Michigan State game. A. suggests we walk to a bar in his neighborhood, but I suggest we stay at his house and watch a movie. He mixes us insanely dirty gin martinis, and I somehow convince him to watch . 11 p.m. — We open a bottle of wine and turn on . Just like last night, I fall asleep before I can even drink my wine, and wake up to the credits rolling. Time for bed. Daily Total: $45",1,98
"10:15 a.m. — Wake up at A.'s and head home pretty quickly. I've been here since Friday night and I want nothing more than to take a shower. We're not super serious, so we don't leave things at each other's places. 11 a.m. — Once I'm home, I throw my sheets in the washer, brew coffee, and jump in the shower. I smoke some weed and make a list of things I need from Target. I have bananas that have reached their end, so I decide to make banana bread. I also decide it's time to switch up the photos in frames I have around my house, so I upload some to the Walgreens website and order prints for same-day pickup. 12:30 p.m. — I swear, I can never leave Target with only what I came for. I end up buying new pillows for my bed, towel hooks for the bathroom, eggs, brown sugar, hot sauce, shredded cheese, aluminum baking pans, a ceramic baking dish, an eyebrow/eyelash brush, dryer sheets, toothbrushes and a travel case, a dish rack/drainer, cotton balls, and chocolate chips. The Cartwheel app saves me about $3. $65.19 1:45 p.m. — I stop by Walgreens to pick up my photos and grab cherry ChapStick while in the checkout line. $6.19 2:20 p.m. — I walk in my door and realize I forgot sour cream for the banana bread. I run across the street to Whole Foods and buy some. $1.69 2:30 p.m. — Finally, I have everything I think I need. I make two loaves of chocolate-chip banana bread, and make myself a quesadilla for lunch while watching old reruns. As the bread bakes, I put my clean sheets on my bed, and swap out my photos. I try to hang the towel hooks, but realize I will need to borrow a drill from my dad, so I smoke more weed and lay on my couch watching . Alicia Florrick is goals. 6:30 p.m. — I do some online shoe shopping. On Friday, I saw a pair of shoes I already own and love on clearance on Last Call. I have them in tan, but really want to get them in black as I know they will get a lot of use. Even though I love them, I waver. I decide to wait until I get paid; if they are still available on Friday, it is meant to be. I browse Macy's for new black booties, and see they are having a 40% off sale. Combined with an extra 25% off for using my Macy's card, the total ends up being $29. I also see a pair of Nikes I have been eyeing since July are on sale for half price, but they don't have my size. By the time I get my shipping info entered in, the boots are out of stock! 6:45 p.m. — Another guy I'm dating, B., calls and asks if he can cook me dinner tonight. I agree since I have zero food at my house despite going to two grocery stores today, and head down to his place in Capitol Hill. I grab one of the loaves of banana bread to give him. 7:15 p.m. — Parking is free in Capitol Hill since it is a Sunday. He is driving back from the mountains and I beat him to his place, so I stop into the bar in his building and have a Tito's and soda while I wait for him. Once he picks me up, we head to the Queen Soopers in his neighborhood and he buys stuff for dinner. We trade off cooking dinner pretty frequently; when he cooks, he buys the groceries and vice versa. $5 8 p.m. — B. cooks salmon and asparagus, and we spend the night watching Netflix. I really lucked out with not one, but two, guys who can cook! Daily Total: $78.07",2,98
"7 a.m. — My alarm goes off and I remember that it snowed overnight. Wonderful. I lay in bed with B. for a while before heading out to scrape off my car and get to my house back. The drive is surprisingly not bad, and I spend it jamming out to music in my car. 8:05 a.m. — Coffee at home while I shower and get ready for work. 9:15 a.m. — I'm extremely fortunate to live about five minutes driving from my office, and we have an underground garage. I was the associate of the quarter for Q2, so I even have a reserved spot. I bring the banana bread to my office and eat a slice for breakfast while I check emails. I work all morning on various projects, and eat a handful of Goldfish out of my desk drawer. 12:30 p.m. — I run to the mall on my lunch break. Nordstrom price matches the Nikes, bringing them from $115 to $69.98. I have store credit from a pair of sunglasses they replaced for me last week, which brings my total to $42.86 that I put on my Nordstrom card. At Macy's, I look for the boots that sold out yesterday and have no luck, but I find something similar. I also scope out a pair of riding boots that I wanted to see in person before ordering. At the register, they won't let me use my additional 25% coupon on top of the sale, which annoys me to no end. I buy the booties anyway since I want to wear them tonight ($42.21). On my way out of the mall, I get on the Macy's app and order the booties plus the riding boots and use the extra 25% off coupon they insisted wouldn't work. I'll return the second pair of booties once the come next week. I get a killer deal and pay way less than half for each pair ($120.63 for both). Both Macy's purchases go on my Macy's card. $205.70 1:20 p.m. — On my way back to the office, I stop at my parents' house to borrow a drill and a stud finder from my dad to hang the towel hooks. I also pick up my mail, which includes the aforementioned Marc Jacobs sunglasses. I broke a pair a few weeks ago and since Nordstrom couldn't fix them, they replaced them for me. I say hi to our golden retriever and make a turkey sandwich to eat in the car. 4:30 p.m. — My friend's mom has extra box tickets to see The xx tonight and asks me if I want to go. Uh, yeah! I dip out of work early and run by the liquor store to pick up a bottle of vodka. At home, I make a drink and get ready. $12.95 5:30 p.m. — Uber downtown to the hotel bar we are meeting at. Turns out, my friend's mom has convinced the whole C-suite (which she is part of) that The xx rules; they are now all coming to the show, and bringing a client! We have happy hour in the swanky cocktail bar, and then the CEO decides we need a sit-down dinner, too. I have no idea what this ends up costing, but I can only imagine. After dinner, my friend and I snag an unopened bottle of Chardonnay off the table for the ride up. $9.26 8:45 p.m. — The CEO has arranged a shuttle to take us all to the show. Turns out, it's a Mercedes sprinter van, which he affectionately dubs ""the bling wagon."" We crank some tunes, crack open the wine, and pass the bottle around. 9:30 p.m. — At the show, the box is catered so drinks are flowing and everyone is having a blast. They open with ""Crystalized"" — my favorite song. Afterwards, the bling wagon totes us all back to the hotel downtown. I try to Uber home but the app isn't working, so I jump in a Lyft with my friend and spend the night at her place in the Highlands. Daily Total: $227.91",3,98
"7:45 a.m. — Both of our phone alarms go off in a painful chorus at the exact same time. I peel myself out of bed and Uber home. Southbound traffic in rush hour is unbelievable. By the time I get home, I decide I'm ""sick"" today and will work remotely. I wash my face, make some coffee, and climb into bed. In other news, Ryan Seacrest is Kelly Ripa's cohost these days. Da fuq? $13.29 9:15 a.m. — Kelly Ripa's enthusiasm is making me nauseous, so I turn on old reruns and field work emails from my bed. 11 a.m. — By some miracle of god, I find bacon in my fridge. I make that and settle in for a client call. 12:30 p.m. — B. calls and asks if I want to meet him and another one of our friends for lunch. I head down to Cherry Creek and meet them at Bombay Clay Oven where we all get the buffet and split the check three ways. Parking in Cherry Creek is a nightmare, so I park in my friend's office building where she will validate it for me later and save $8. $18.46 2 p.m. — B. and I decide to cross the street to the mall; he needs a belt and I want to look at a ring in David Yurman that I'm thinking about buying myself for my birthday later this year. I buy a Diet Coke and drink it while we walk around. In David Yurman, the salesperson asks me if the ring is on my wish list, and I tell him, ""Yes. My birthday wish list."" B. then asks how much it costs ($675) and nods his head. I leave the store wondering if he will surprise me with it for my birthday? I would definitely have to stop dating other people after that... $2.37 4:15 p.m. — As we are leaving the mall, I remember I have a client call scheduled for this afternoon. B. asks if he can bring his laundry over to my place (his building charges and I have in unit washer and dryer). He has to run a quick errand, so I stop and grab a drink while I take the client call. Then, I meet him back at his place to help him gather and load everything into his car. $6.50 6 p.m. — Back at my place, B. sets up his computer to work for a bit and I get started on the laundry. My friends think it's weird that I wash his clothes for him, but it's an easy thing to do that he really appreciates. It's just not that big of a deal to me. Plus, this way I can discreetly toss out anything that I'm not a fan of. ""Oh, that Sean John t-shirt from 2004? No idea where it went, babe..."" 8:15 p.m. — It's Taco Tuesday! B. and I head to Adelita's for $1 tacos, chips, guac, and margaritas. We split the tab. The couple sitting next to us tells us that the ice cream shop next door does $1 ice cream ""tacos"" as well (a waffle cone shaped into a taco shell), so of course we have to try them! I get peanut butter M&M and B. gets Oreo. He pays the $2 and I throw in a quarter for tax. $24.25 10 p.m. — Back at my place, we agree we want to go out and decide on $2 bowling at Lucky Strike. I call an Uber to take us to 16th Street. At Lucky Strike, B. buys us a round of beers, loads money onto a game card, and we play Skee-Ball while we wait for a lane to open. I am the Skee-Ball queen and he has never beat me in the year we have been dating. When it's our turn to bowl, he pays for two games of bowling and shoe rental for both of us. $4.62 11:30 p.m. — While we bowl, I order more beers and cheese curds, which turn out to be underwhelming and completely unnecessary. We run into some friends who are also bowling and all agree to hit one more bar before last call. We end up at Tarantula where B. pays for our beers and we play a few rounds of pool. Right as the bar is closing, I turn around and notice some dude has his pants down and is peeing right there on the floor! It's a Tuesday, man! Come on! $30.17 Daily Total: $99.66",4,98
"1:30 a.m. — Last call is over and right as we head to leave, one of our friends tells the bouncer about floor peeing guy. The bouncer chases him down the street, puts him in a headlock, and drags him back into the bar to force him to clean it up. We take that as our cue to dip ASAP and jump in an Uber back to my place. $6.88 7:45 a.m. — My alarm goes off and I make the executive decision to make today another work from home day. I go back to sleep for a few hours and when I wake up, I make us coffee and answer work emails in bed. 1 p.m. — We are both starving and B. wants breakfast food, so we drive to Original Pancake House for sustenance. I get the Denver omelet and orange juice. This week has been out of the ordinary for me with restaurant spending, and I realize I have spent a ridiculous amount of money. I take my leftovers home and vow to eat them for lunch tomorrow. $21.46 2 p.m. — We swing by the store on the way back to my house for laundry detergent and coffee. I use my store's app for digital coupons and save $3 on the detergent. $9.41 6 p.m. — I am going to a surprise birthday party downtown later tonight, so I decide to spend the night at B.'s since it is closer. Parking at his place in Capitol Hill is free after 6, and I Uber in gridlock traffic over the Speer Bridge into the Highlands. The party is a hit — the birthday boy is so surprised! We have drinks and snacks and sing lots of Ariana Grande. $4.80 9 p.m. — I am trying to be good tonight since I have been such a party animal this week, so I say my goodbyes relatively early. If I didn't leave now, guaranteed I would go out with everyone to the gay bar and be out all night. I grab an Uber back to B.'s ($4.62) and snag a bottle of Malbec on my way ($11.80). At his place, we each have a glass of wine, heat up some of the banana bread in a bowl with ice cream, and share it while we Netflix and chill on the couch. $16.42 11 p.m. — Wash my face and go to bed. Daily Total: $58.97",5,98
"7 a.m. — Alarm goes off and I jump right out of bed, something that never happens. There is no traffic on the way back to my place which makes for a great start to my day. At home, I shower/coffee/hair/makeup per usual. I get a text from a family friend that I occasionally work catering gigs for. I decline the event she asks about, but make a mental note to pick up a few gigs before the holidays. I could easily take care of all my holiday shopping if I worked two events — the money is that good. 9:15 a.m. — I spend my morning preparing for a client call, and then an hour on the phone with them for our weekly status updates. I sneak in a granola bar from my desk for breakfast. The company I work for sponsors a scholarship at CU to try to recruit new hires, and the HR supervisor comes over to my desk to remind me that I am taking the winner out to lunch today. She offers me her corporate credit card which I appreciate. Now I don't have to submit an expense report! 12 p.m. — I meet the scholarship winner and take him to lunch at a restaurant across the street from my office. Two coworkers from my department also join us. We get spinach artichoke dip for the table, and I order French onion soup and a French dip. The winner is a nice kid, but it's pretty clear he has no idea what insurance brokers actually do. When the check comes, I use the corporate card to pay. ($85.16 expensed) 4:30 p.m. — On my way home from work, I stop at the gas station and put air in one of my tires just to make the warning on my dashboard go away. $1.50 5 p.m. — I realize I have spent every night for the past week out or with someone, so I relish being by myself tonight. I throw a load of laundry in the machine, pour a glass of wine, and smoke some weed while I watch . I wanted to be an attorney when I was a little kid, and kind of still do... 8 p.m. — I pull together a dinner of frozen dumplings, random veggies, and a teriyaki sauce in my fridge. For dessert, I snack on chocolate chips and Insta-stalk B.'s ex-girlfriend, which sends me in a stoned haze down the social media rabbit hole. The girl is a teacher and the spelling errors in her posts are both comical and horrifying. 9:30 p.m. — I finally get a grip and put my phone down. I run the dishwasher, take out the trash, and do a little bit of work on my computer before I put on a face mask and head to bed. I sprawl out in my bed and watch reruns until I fall asleep. Daily Total: $1.50",6,98
"6:15 a.m. — I am woken up entirely too early by a frantic phone call from my best friend. Her boyfriend, whom she lives with and who basically bankrolls her life, broke up with her this morning and she's panicking. As I talk her off the ledge, I silently think to myself how happy I am that my finances aren't at the mercy of another individual. I did that once in my early twenties and learned the hard way to never allow it again. Her boyfriend's entire world revolves around the fact that he has the financial means to do essentially anything he wants — and he has no problem letting people know it. The man repulses me, quite honestly. 7:45 a.m. — Coffee and usual routine at home. 9:30 a.m. — Today is payday, and this will be the first check that reflects the 12% pay increase I received last week. I love my job, but I worked my ass off the past year and deserve every cent. It is nice to feel appreciated and validated at work; I have too many friends who do not have this experience. My salary is now approximately $65,000 and this check reflects the new wages plus approximately four months of retro-pay. The check total after tax, 401(k), insurance, etc. is $2,961. I multiply my regular check amount by 1.12 to find my increased check amount, and then transfer over the rest to my ""savings"" account which is really a slush fund. I need to get better about saving for emergencies, but at least retirement and health expenses are automatically deducted for me. 11 a.m. — My work wife and I head to Torchy's Tacos for lunch. We snag two seats at the bar and order margaritas and tacos and vent to each other about pretty much everything. Work wife (WW) is a little bit older than me and has been with the company longer, so I truly value her input and perspective on things. She is intelligent and beautiful and I want to be her when I grow up. WW is married, but coaches me how she thinks I should handle things between B. and A. — ditch B. and pursue things with A. — which is exactly what every other friend of mine thinks. $35.11 2 p.m. — I somehow accepted an invite for a carrier call on a Friday afternoon; not sure how that happened. I get an email from the engagement program of our health insurance notifying me that my health club subsidy has been processed and they are sending me a check for $177. You would never know it by my activities this week, but I do belong to (and use!) a gym, and my parents have paid the automatically renewing membership fee since I was in high school. 5:30 p.m. — After work, I head to the salon by my house to get my nails done. I have had busted nails for a few days now and I can't take it any longer. I get a fresh set of coffin shaped tips and I bring my own polish: OPI ""Meet Me on the Star Ferry."" I went through a phase where I was obsessed with nail polish and I have a filing cabinet in my closet of about 40o polishes, so the selection at the salon never compares. $38 7:30 p.m. — My dad calls and asks if I want to come over to my parents' house for dinner. Our golden retriever had surgery this week, so of course I want to see her! He picks me up on his way to the house and cooks us dinner while my mom and I drink wine, listen and sing to music, and just generally annoy him. I lied earlier this week: I have three good cooks in my life these days. 10 p.m. — After dinner, we start watching the new series about the Menendez brothers. I get in an argument with B. over weekend plans and immediately set up a date with A. for tomorrow — a chili cook-off and beer tasting event. When the show is over, my dad insists on paying for an Uber to take me home. 10:30 p.m. — Finally home and I crash. Daily Total: $73.11",7,98
"8:30 a.m. — Wake up to my kitty alarm and real alarm. I feed the kitty and make a large quantity of coffee in my Chemex, also putting together a quick breakfast of homemade granola, sliced banana, and a splash of almond milk. I recently started a new position where I work from home, and I have really loved the savings from not buying coffee or breakfast out. 9 a.m. — My boyfriend leaves for work and I get started with my day: reviewing and organizing my inbox, making a to-do list for the week, and starting some client outreach. I hunker down for a few hours of work. 12:30 p.m. — The morning went by fast! I love having consistent work and projects to do because my last job was pretty much the opposite and every day dragged on forever. I take a break for lunch and remember I need to order one last Christmas gift for my friend. I'm doing a ""self-care"" package for her, including her favorite nail polish and blooming tea. I complete the trio with an aromatherapy diffuser and set of eight essential oils. I love me some themed gifts! I'm not terribly hungry, so I snack on almonds and a few clementines. $37.04 5:30 p.m. — Done with work for the day. I drive to the gym where I do a bare minimum workout of running two miles on the treadmill and core work. I took an unintentional gym hiatus these past few months, so I'm trying to ease back into a routine without burning out. 6:30 p.m. — Before I head home, I text my boyfriend to see what we should do for dinner. We're both feeling lazy, so I place an order at Mamoun's for two falafel sandwiches, tabbouleh, and two mango juices and pick it up on my way home. We smoke a joint, eat, watch , and are in bed around 10:30. $16.85 Daily Total: $53.89",1,99
"8:30 a.m. — Wake up, feed the kitty, and go through my usual weekday morning routine of making coffee and a granola bowl. I listen to SZA's album to get the day started right. 12 p.m. — Break for lunch. I eat almonds and clementines again, but also mash up half an avocado I have in the fridge and put it over a toasted slice of Ezekiel bread. I call my mom to chat. I recently moved back to my home state, and a great perk is being able to see my mom way more than I have in the past few years living in another city. We make plans to go to dinner tonight. 6 p.m. — I meet my mom at Barcelona, a tapas and wine bar, for dinner. It's one of my favorites! We get a cheese and charcuterie board, and of course some tapas: patatas bravas, roasted cauliflower, and bacon wrapped dates. I offer to pay, but my mom insists on covering the bill because she's an angel. 9 p.m. — I drive home and stop for gas along the way. My car is small and gets great gas mileage, so pending any road trips I'm not aware of, this should last me at least two weeks. I head home and (tearfully) read some of my current book, . Fall asleep around 10:30. $20 Daily Total: $20",2,99
"7:30 a.m. — I have an earlier start today because I signed up for a Vinyasa yoga class at my gym (included in my membership). While I truly hate waking up any earlier than I absolutely have to, I come out of class refreshed and happy to have gotten exercise out of the way. I drive home to get started on work for the day. 1 p.m. — The morning and early afternoon flew by again, partly due to client fires that had to be put out. I feel super lucky to have a great group of coworkers that are knowledgeable and supportive, despite the fact that we all work remotely! I am also ravenous because I only had coffee after I got back from yoga. I toast two slices of Ezekiel bread, mash half an avocado on each, and poach two eggs to put on top. I garnish with Maldon sea salt and liberal amounts of sriracha. 5 p.m. — I wrap up work for the day and text my boyfriend; we are running pretty low on groceries. He offers to stop by the store on his way home from work, and gets more Ezekiel bread, avocados, eggs, pasta, crushed tomatoes, cheddar cheese, kale, sweet potatoes, bananas, clementines, tomato soup, and oatmeal raisin cookies ($51.29). We split the bill and I send him $25 via Venmo. $25 6:30 p.m. — My boyfriend makes one of my favorite comfort meals for dinner: grilled cheese sandwiches and tomato soup. It may be simple but it is delicious. We eat and watch a few episodes of , and smoke a little on our weed vape pen. I read more of my book before bed and we fall asleep around 11. Daily Total: $25",3,99
"8:30 a.m. — Normal morning routine. I have a lot of work to get done today and tomorrow so I dive in. 12:30 p.m. — Come up for air and take a break for lunch. I roast a sweet potato and eat it over kale with Caesar dressing. Gap is offering 40% all merchandise for a Cyber Monday and Black Friday deal, so I peruse and pick out Christmas gifts for my boyfriend — fleece-lined khaki pants, a sweater, and two pairs of socks. I have an online shopping compulsion (see credit card debt) that I've been trying to reign in the past year, but I justify this purchase because it's almost half off — and it's not for me! $85.51 5:30 p.m. — I finish up with work and try to decide what to make for dinner. I make a quick tomato sauce with crushed tomatoes, garlic, and spices, and put pasta on to boil. My boyfriend comes home just as I'm finishing up, and we sit down to eat the pasta with a finishing of pecorino Romano. 8:30 p.m. — Boyfriend and I are having strong ice cream cravings (despite the fact that it's winter outside now). We cave and drive over to Arethusa Dairy, an amazing ice cream shop in town that also has a great dairy farm in the state and produces tons of milk, cheese, and ice cream. He gets a shake mixed with raspberry and chocolate ice cream, and I get one of their handmade waffle cones with two scoops of almond toasted coconut ($10.50). My boyfriend pays and leaves a $2 tip. We head home and enjoy our ice cream before bed like the heathens we are. Daily Total: $85.51",4,99
"7:30 a.m. — I go to the Vinyasa class again because I enjoyed it so much. I also have Friday Feels energy and surprisingly have no trouble getting myself up and out. The class is great again, but I forgot my water bottle and have to buy one at the gym. I feel guiltier about using a plastic water bottle than I do about spending the cash, but I'll make sure to recycle it later. Back home to start work. $2 11:30 a.m. — I take an earlier lunch break than usual because I'm super hungry. I make another avocado toast with poached eggs. Sometimes I feel like I eat the same three to five meals in rotation, but honestly, I'm fine with that. 5 p.m. — I shut down work a little earlier than usual and get ready to meet up with a friend for dinner at Mecha, an Asian-fusion restaurant. I change into something that's not my work-from-home uniform (Lululemon and sweaters) and put on makeup. Even when I go out, I don't tend to wear that much; just a few swipes of NARS Creamy Concealer and Benefit's Gimme Brow and GALifornia blush. 7 p.m. — Meet up with my friend at Mecha. Another great benefit of being back in my home state is meeting up with friends I haven't seen in a few years! She is the type of friend I can always pick up with right where we left off, so we have a great time eating delicious food and chatting. We get a few baos, kimchi fried rice, and Thai spare ribs. She gets a cognac Thai tea cocktail, but I don't drink so I stick to Diet Coke. We split the food and tip, and pay for our own beverages. $30 9:30 p.m. — I text my boyfriend, who is at a jazz show at a nearby bar. My friend and I meet up with him and watch the rest of the show. There's a $5 cover, which I pay for both of us because she doesn't have cash. ($10) I get another Diet Coke at the bar and enjoy the live music. My friend heads out, and then my boyfriend and I head home shortly after, around 12 a.m. It's past my bedtime so I fall asleep almost immediately! $12 Daily Total: $44",5,99
"10:30 a.m. — I wake up and sloooooowly make my way out of bed. I relish being able to sleep in on the weekends and take the day at a slow pace. I put water on for coffee, make pancake batter with our industrial box of Bisquik, and caramelize bananas for the topping. The coffee and griddle scents wake up my boyfriend, and he joins me in the kitchen for breakfast. 1 p.m. — We make our way out of the house to run an errand. This is the first apartment we've lived in together without roommates and I really want to get a Christmas tree this year! We go to Big Lots and get a tree stand and string lights. We debate the light colors, since I prefer the more classic, minimalist look of clear lights and he likes the colorful kind. I win the light color battle, with the compromise being that we'll also make a popcorn garland to string. Fine by me! $17.01 3:30 p.m. — By the time we're ready to head home, we realize the tree farm closes in 30 minutes. I really don't want to rush it, so we decide to wait until tomorrow. At least we'll have all the finishings and we can just drop the tree right in. 4 p.m. — At home, I make good on my popcorn-garland compromise and get started on that endeavor. We have a tub of loose kernels, so I put them on the stove in a covered pan and hope for the best. They shockingly don't burn or catch fire, so we string the popped corn with a needle and thread, and rinse and repeat until we have way more than we need. I carefully roll up the completed garland and put it in a box on the cabinet, far away from the prying hands of the kitty. We spend the rest of the day lounging and watching TV. Daily Total: $17.01",6,99
"10:30 a.m. — Wake up and head out to find our tree! We first stop at Dunkin' for a quick breakfast of coffee and a bagel, which my boyfriend and I split. I pay and tip $2. $10.52 11 a.m. — We arrive at the quaint tree farm, a few towns over from where we live. They have complimentary hot chocolate, which makes this place a hit in my book already. We roam the grounds of the farm with a little saw they give us until we find the perfect Douglas Fir. My boyfriend saws it down and we carry it back to the car, strapping it on the roof with bungee cords I keep in my trunk. I am so happy we got a tree, and I can definitely feel the Christmas spirit building. $50 2 p.m. — We get home and put the tree in its stand, which is a little more difficult than I expected. Once it's secure, we add the lights and popcorn garland, and it looks amazing! Even though we don't have any ornaments right now, it still looks beautiful and I'm so happy to have my first real Christmas tree as an adult. It's only a matter of time before the kitty gets curious about it, so I'll enjoy it while it lasts. Daily Total: $60.52",7,99
"8:30 a.m. — Ah, Mondays. Wake up, freshen up, and log on to my work computer. I'm currently between projects (as can happen in consulting) and I usually work from home when unstaffed. Not one to turn down the opportunity to sleep in a little! 10 a.m. — I hate eating first thing in the morning and avoid it whenever it's an option. Finally make my way into the kitchen to make a quick breakfast of toast, eggs, and tea. I'm Pakistani, and black tea with milk and sugar (a.k.a. chai) is, as DJ Khaled would say, major key. 11 a.m. — Chat with my HR rep about the start date for my upcoming project. The onboarding is taking ages since the client requires a ton of security checks and documenting, and I'm starting to get antsy. Being “on the bench” is nice at first, but boredom starts to set in pretty fast. In this case, though, there's not much I can do to speed it up; in the meantime, it looks like it'll be another slow day. 12 p.m. — Read up on the status of the wildfires raging down in SoCal; they look as bad as ever. Worried, I shoot a few texts to friends who live in and around L.A. Here in the Bay Area we had our own turn with wildfires in October, with hundreds of thousands of acres scorched in Napa, Sonoma, and other nearby counties. Berkeley itself was okay, but the air quality was so poor here that I, and many others, turned to respirator masks to get relief from the throat irritation and coughing. The news says the fires in SoCal are so massive we can expect air quality up here to suffer once more. It's scary and saddening to see the effects of climate change play out in such a stark and destructive manner. 2 p.m. — Do a little Amazon browsing, and end up buying a Kindle Paperwhite for my cousin in Pakistan. He asked me to buy one for him, and he'll pay me back; electronics like these are much more expensive and difficult to get there. My family went to Pakistan almost every summer when I was growing up, so I'm pretty close to my cousins there and don't mind helping them out. This cousin in question has a friend in Berkeley who will be returning to the motherland in a few days, and can take it with him to deliver. $115 3 p.m. — Realize that I'm getting hungry, and reheat the leftover salmon I made last night —broiled with dill, butter, and garlic, with steamed zucchini on the side — for a late lunch. 5 p.m. — Log off work for the day. Here's hoping I can start my project soon. One can only browse so much news before one's grip on reality becomes tenuous. 6:30 p.m. — Leave my apartment and head for BART, which I'll charge to my pre-loaded Clipper card. I'm meeting friends in San Francisco to watch , which I've been wanting to see for weeks now. I love Greta Gerwig and coming-of-age movies, so I'm looking forward to it. 7:30 p.m. — Get to the theater right as the trailers start. I quickly purchase my ticket and locate my friends. Thankfully, it's a weeknight so it's not too crowded and we're able to find a group of decent seats together. $13 9:30 p.m. — was lovely. I really empathized with Lady Bird's complex and often fraught relationship with her mom; it reminded me of my senior year in high school. We discuss the film for a bit before splitting up; it is a weeknight, after all, and we all have work tomorrow. I try to avoid taking BART alone at night, so call an Uber Pool. $10.89 10:30 p.m. — Get back home and am a little peckish, but not enough to cook a real meal. Settle on toast with PB&J. The classics are the classics for a reason. Daily Total: $138.89",1,100
"8:30 a.m. — Up and at 'em. I wake up, freshen up, log on, etc. Toast and tea for breakfast, part two. Make a note to get more preservative-free saline eye drops soon. I got LASIK done last year, and while the pros far outweigh the cons, the chronic dry eyes — especially with my large amount of screen time — are real. 11 a.m. — Still no sign of movement on the project onboarding. It's more than a little frustrating. While checking my email, I get a notice from a popular event organizer in the Bay — Rep. Adam Schiff, D-CA, is coming to speak in San Francisco in February! I am a fan of the Congressman and admire his bravery and tenacity, so getting a ticket is a no-brainer. $23.16 12 p.m. — Mega-cringe for the day: I check in to see how Alabama's senatorial election is going because I'm a masochist, and can only cringe at the latest ridiculous, potentially bigoted statements emanating from Roy Moore's camp. I have zero idea what's happening in America these days, or where these people are coming from. It's like a massive parody that was rejected for being too on-the-nose has become our reality. 2 p.m. — Lunch is a slightly haphazard affair of whatever leftovers I can find in my fridge. I desperately need groceries. I come up with leftover Chinese, and supplement it with steamed veggies on the side. I am a domestic goddess. 5:30 p.m. — Head for Trader Joe's, determined to have a less pathetic dinner. Buy milk, eggs, olive oil, turkey bacon, tuna steaks, a salmon fillet, Havarti cheese, sweet potatoes, brussels sprouts, zucchini, penne pasta, marinara sauce, mushrooms, an eggplant, buttermilk, shrimp, chicken pot stickers, garlic naan, a single-serve palak paneer meal (no judgement zone), and a bar of dark chocolate. $67.73 7:30 p.m. — Whip out my cast-iron pan and make seared tuna steaks, with roasted brussels sprouts and baked sweet potato fries on the side. It turns out pretty well, and I feel I've mostly redeemed myself. 8 p.m. — Holy hell, Doug Jones won. Well done, Alabama. I donated to his campaign last month, but even then thought his to be a quixotic last stand. I've never been so happy to be wrong. I donate $20 to the NAACP in celebration; they were instrumental in getting out the vote. Spend the rest of the evening reading pollsters' hot takes and exchanging exclamation mark-filled messages with friends. $20 Daily Total: $110.89",2,100
"8:30 a.m. — Tea and, in a stunning break from the norm, oatmeal. Look at me, spreading my wings. 9 a.m. — Start the day with a call: FedEx is outside with the iPhone X I ordered last week. It's not for me, though, but for another cousin in Pakistan. This is obviously a bigger-ticket item than the Kindle, but this cousin and I are quite close and I don't mind doing her a solid. (My iPhone 6 is still chugging along.) 11 a.m. — A sigh of relief: I receive word from HR and my manager that I'm finally cleared to start the project! I'll be starting at the client site on Monday. Hallelujah. While I am definitely a homebody, even I've started to go stir-crazy. This is very welcome news. 1 p.m. — Polish off the other tuna steak and the rest of the sweet potato fries (which I could honestly eat forever, they are SO GOOD) for lunch. Realize with some alarm that I've also somehow worked my way through a quarter of the dark chocolate bar already. I move it to a different counter. 2 p.m. — Post lunch, check my email to see I've gotten a flurry of emails from various members of the team I'll be joining. Even though I start Monday, there's always an expectation in consulting that you'll hit the ground running as soon as you start, so you don't waste the client's time and money. The emails make it clear there is no shortage of demos, overviews of applications I'll be working with and testing, and workflow charts I can start going through. I'll be working in the healthcare space, and though I've done other projects in this industry, I have not performed this specific role. This is gonna be interesting. Here we go. 5 p.m. — After work and already feeling the effects of information overload from the sheer number of PowerPoint presentations I have to look through. I swing by the UPS store, where an Amazon package was dropped off for me. Grab a latte on the way back. $3.30 6:30 p.m. — Spend some time looking over my cryptocurrency holdings. I've been interested in crypto since I took a course on block chain technology in college, and about a year ago, I bought small amounts of a few cryptocurrencies out of interest in the projects. I've seen some gains since then, but nothing matches Bitcoin's explosive growth in the last month alone: On November 1, it hovered around $6,000 a coin. At time of writing this, it is around $17,000 a coin. That kind of growth is obviously unprecedented — and totally irrational. I can only ascribe this parabolic growth to the sudden spike in societal awareness of crypto in general and Bitcoin in particular. I worry that people who don't appreciate how high-risk crypto is are investing irresponsible amounts of money in it, in the hopes of getting rich quick. The cardinal rule of cryptocurrency is to never invest more than you can afford to lose, and I fear we're headed for a crash that will have ugly consequences for many. 9 p.m. — Watch an episode of on Netflix. I love Michelle Dockery so I thought I'd give it a try, but it's not doing much for me. After, I suffer through a round of HIIT on FitnessBlender. I don't know whose idea mountain climbers were, but I'd like to write them a strongly-worded letter. Daily Total: $3.30",3,100
"9 a.m. — Out the door to meet my cousin's friend. (The one returning to Pakistan, who is delivering the Kindle and iPhone.) My familial duties are complete. The kid looks a bit frazzled; it's finals week, apparently, and he doesn't look like he has slept in a while. I certainly don't miss those days. Get a bagel at Noah's on the way back; the cashier surprises me by giving it to me on the house. Nice start to the day! 11 a.m. — More introductory materials to go through. These demos are loooong. Wondering why knowledge transfer via osmosis isn't a thing yet. 1 p.m. — Fry some chicken pot stickers with a side of steamed zucchini for lunch. Read up on the FCC's vote to repeal net neutrality for a bit before closing my internet browser in disgust. (Take that, ISPs!) This is why we can't have nice things, y'all. My periodic desire to shun society and take up life as a nomad living out of a yurt somewhere flares up. 2 p.m. — Beat down escapist fantasies and open another PowerPoint. I'd make a terrible goatherd, anyway. 5:30 p.m. — After logging off for the day, I make penne for dinner with marinara sauce, ground beef, eggplant, mushroom, and plenty of spices. Listen to the new episode of as I cook. I saw them live last week and they were great; very personable and witty. 7 p.m. — Chat on the phone with my mom for a bit; she's pleased that I'm finally starting my project, and we then move on to the major subject at hand. My brother's getting married next month, and South Asian weddings are crazy, probably over-the-top, multi-day, loud, colorful, family affairs, with tons of food, choreographed Bollywood-style dancing. I'll be desperately trying to remain upright in a sari without accidentally ripping the whole thing off due to misplaced steps. My mom's been in planning mode for months, and though it's been a logistical nightmare, I'm looking forward to the actual event. Daily Total: $0",4,100
"8:30 a.m. — I'm going into the city today to work out of the office, which I try to do at least once a week when I'm unstaffed. I pour my tea into a thermos and eat my toast on the go as I head to BART. 10 a.m. — The office is pretty busy since most consultants don't work at their client sites on Fridays. My assigned space turns out to be in a slightly cramped room shared with two guys on a very loud conference call. Yay. 12 p.m. — Escape the room at lunch, going to my favorite halal food truck and buying a gyro rice plate. Probably unhealthy, but I love it too much. It's a nice day in SF so I go for a walk through the Financial District after eating. $10 1:30 p.m. — Get a very welcome email: Thanks to the work survey I took last week, I've won a ticket to see the Warriors play the Grizzlies next week! My firm works with the Warriors so we get opportunities like this on occasion. My number one team will always be the Rockets (11 straight wins, baby!) but with six years in the Bay, I've adopted the Dubs as a secondary team. They're always fun to watch. 6:30 p.m. — Meet my friends at the movie theater. We have tickets for , and as I'm very serious about my , I insisted we all get here early to secure good seats. I refuse to be stuck in the front row while Rey struggles with the dark side. My friend purchased our tickets online yesterday, so I Venmo him as we walk in. Now, time to enter a galaxy far, far away… $15.69 10 p.m. — Omg. That was so good. I am, as the kids say, shook. No spoilers, but fans of the franchise should be pleased. was amazing but I was a little disappointed by as I thought the plot was too similar to . There's no fear of that here. Also, it was long and I'm now starving. Aside from nightlife, SF kind of shuts down after 10 p.m., but there are a few bars with dinner menus, so we Uber to one (my friend pays). After battling our way to a table, we finally eat. I get a cheeseburger, which is delicious, and we split a slice of cake. $23 12 a.m. — My friends want to go barhopping, and though I don't drink, I usually accompany them to the first few spots because it's fun to hang out. Everywhere is crowded, so conversation is limited, but we finally end up in a pub with a free table and post up for a bit. 1:30 a.m. — I'm dead and call it quits. BART tragically closes at midnight, so I split an Uber back to Berkeley with a friend who also lives here. It's still crazy expensive, but prices surge after midnight and pretty much stay there until at least 3 a.m. I get home around 2 a.m. and happily crawl into bed. $17 Daily Total: $65.69",5,100
"10:30 a.m. — Sleep in with zero guilt, and consider sleeping more even after my alarm goes off. Alas, I have plans to go hiking with friends and one is already en route to pick me up. I bid a sad farewell to my bed, get myself together, and inhale toast and tea by the time she arrives. 11:15 a.m. — We stop by Ike's, a popular Bay Area sandwich chain, to grab rations. I get a Ménage à Trois on Dutch Crunch (they go for zany names). It's my Ike's go-to and is named for its three cheeses (cheddar, pepper jack, and Swiss) and three sauces (barbecue, honey mustard, and honey) paired with chicken and lettuce. It's delicious. I cover my friends' food as well, since they're doing all the driving. $34.06 1 p.m. — After picking up our other friend, we make our way up to Point Reyes National Seashore up in Marin where we'll be hiking. It's beautiful up here and has a huge variety of great trails, many along the coast. One of my favorite things about the Bay is its easy access to nature. Since we arrived relatively late in the day, with not too many hours of sunlight left, we pick a moderate five-mile hike. 3 p.m. — Inhale our sandwiches at our stopping point, a beautiful vista overlooking the Pacific. Attempt several hilarious backlit selfies. 5:30 p.m. — We return to the parking lot just as it starts to get dark. I am so over daylight savings and winter; it's pitch black by 6 p.m. and makes me want to stay in bed watching Netflix. It was a great hike, though, and I resolve to do this more often. (I'm also embarrassingly sore, so eventually my legs will approve of this choice.) 6:30 p.m. — On our way back, we stop at a coffee shop, in desperate need of caffeine. It's attached to a little vintage store and I flip through their collection of used records, coming across a vinyl of . I don't think twice about buying it; my dad is a huge jazz fan, and I grew up listening to Ella, Louis Armstrong, Miles Davis, Dave Brubeck, etc. on his record player. This will be a nice surprise for him when I go home for the holidays! Meanwhile, my friend covers our coffee. $13.02 7:30 p.m. — Finally get back to Berkeley; my friend kindly drops me off. I'm beat, with zero inclination to do anything past showering and changing into pajamas. I do just that, then eat the other half of my sandwich. (Ike's sandwiches are massive.) Next stop: Overall, a good day. Daily Total: $47.08",6,100
"11 a.m. — Peel myself out of bed pretty late, but I'm sore from yesterday and can't be too bothered about it. Looking forward to a lazy Sunday, especially with my project starting Monday! 11:30 a.m. — In the kitchen, I whip up chocolate-chip buttermilk pancakes, my monthly tradition. They take a little while but are so worth it; breakfast is my favorite meal of the day. Have a pancake with turkey bacon on the side and tea. 1 p.m. — I didn't get through all the materials I need to look at for Monday, and since I don't want to embarrass myself, I dedicate the afternoon to getting up to speed. 4 p.m. — Finally set my work laptop aside. There's only so much you can absorb, and the best learning comes from doing, so Monday will be a bit of a crash-course anyway. Have some of the pasta I made earlier in the week. 4:30 p.m. — Wanting to stretch my legs a little, I go for a walk through the UC Berkeley campus, which is gorgeous and abandoned. The students gone for winter break and I make my way into downtown Berkeley before turning around. While I like SF, I think I prefer the smaller-town vibe Berkeley has. It also smells a lot better than the city, which assaults you with a barrage of odors every time you walk out of a BART station. 7 p.m. — Make my second cup of tea and then, after some consideration because I don't feel like cooking, have more pasta. 8 p.m. — Spend the rest of the evening cleaning my apartment and planning for Monday, before getting into bed by midnight. My sleep schedule is totally shot after my irregular week, so tomorrow morning is going to be painful regardless of when I sleep, but no harm in trying! Daily Total: $0",7,100
"7 a.m. — One of my worst habits and best talents is my ability to calculate exactly how much time I need to get somewhere, and then take advantage of it by waiting until the last minute to get ready. This is exemplified by me waking up at 7, having to be at work by 8, and having a 30-minute commute. I feel like a tornado, running around getting ready and packing my things, but it's worth the extra sleep. 8:15 a.m. — I get to work just in time and make oatmeal in the kitchen. Oatmeal is such a sad breakfast, but it's cheap, easy, and healthy, so I've eaten it almost every day since I started working full time. 12 p.m. — I am starving! I walk to the Subway close to my office for a meatball marinara; they're only $2 this month! Unfortunately, they are out of meatballs, so I get a cold-cut combo for the same price. I run into a girl I knew in college and can't remember her name for the life of me, but she remembers mine and we make small talk in the line. $2 1 p.m. — One of my coworkers has a buy-one, get-one-free coupon at Chipotle and I go with her to split it. I already ate, but I'll keep this in the fridge for future lunches. I usually get a salad base at Chipotle, but they're out of salad. Secretly, I'm not too upset and ask to pile on rice. My coworker pays since I paid last time we split. 2 p.m. — My company's Christmas party is this Saturday and we get to invite plus ones. I'm as single as can be, so I've asked my guy BFF to come with me, as I know he'll be great company. I want to get him a tie to match my dress as a ""Thanks for coming"" Christmas gift. I tried ordering the tie online to pick it up in-store a few days ago, but there were lots of issues. I'm trying to buy it again. I also get a pair of leggings for myself. $52 4:45 p.m. — I sneak out of work a little early to make it to a yoga class I really like. It starts at 5, and according to my calculations, 17 minutes is the exact amount of time I need to get to my car, drive to the studio, park, change into workout clothes, and set up my mat. I finish the class as a sweaty mess and head home. 7:30 p.m. — I shower and get ready to meet some of my girlfriends. We're going to River Oaks to see the multimillion dollar houses all lit up for Christmas. I fry some eggs and eat them quickly to avoid spending money later in the evening. One of the friends I'm meeting works at a shoe store and bought a pair of shoes for me with her discount. The shoes are $30, but I only have $10 in cash. I take a $20 bill from my mom to give to my friend. $10 9 p.m. — The lights are gorgeous! I dream of owning a home in this ZIP code one day. We go to a hookah bar after to eat and smoke shisha. The fried eggs don't hold me and I order a Greek salad ($5), a bottle of water ($1 — it sucks how hookah bars always charge for water), and pay my portion of the hookah. $18 Daily Total: $82",1,101
"7 a.m. — In tornado mode. I rush through my skincare routine: Juice Beauty cleanser, Foreo Play brush, and The Ordinary squalane serum and sunscreen. 8:30 a.m. — One of my vendors is hosting a Christmas luncheon, and in an effort to save my appetite, I sub my oatmeal for a square of chocolate one of my coworkers brought from a weekend trip out of state. 10 a.m. — Turns out that chocolate is not a good substitute for breakfast. (Or at least a small piece isn't.) But I'm too busy finishing things before the luncheon to eat anything else. 12 p.m. — The luncheon is great! I grab chicken piccata, ravioli, bread, and salad. I'm disappointed in the dessert though; it's cheesecake, but tastes frozen. I eat one bite and leave the rest. 2 p.m. — A client delivers cupcakes from one of my favorite bakeries to the office! I eat a chocolate one at my desk. 5 p.m. — I leave work and head to a 5:30 p.m. flow class. I get such cheap yoga because I'm still cruising on my student membership from when I signed up in college. I can justify that because I'm still college-aged, and I've referred lots of friends to my studio, right...? 7 p.m. — I head to the mall to sort out the tie situation, and much to my annoyance, no mall in my area has the tie I want! I'm frustrated because there are several charges on my card and no tie in my hands. I cancel the leggings and the tie I ordered and plot another way to get it in time for the party. I kick myself for not ordering it earlier. 8 p.m. — On my way home, my mom calls and asks me to pick up a tray of biriyani and to withdraw $70 to pay for it. She tells me the place is close to home, but when I look it up, it's 10 miles away! I'm already annoyed at having to deal with this after the tie mishap, and when I get to the ATM, I have to withdraw in increments of $20. When I pick the food up, it turns out the total is only $60. I head home and eat a little of the biryani. It's too oily and spicy for my liking, plus I'm not that hungry after my heavy lunch. My mom gives me $70 later, but I only take $40 since the dish was $60 and I took money from her yesterday to buy my shoes. She would never ask me to pay her back, but I'm trying to get out of my high school and college ways and be an adult. Normally, I wouldn't take any money back from her at all for something like this, but this month is tough with gifts and holiday stuff, so I accept. 10:30 p.m. — I've become a bit of a grandma since I started working. I shower, complete my night time skin care with the addition of the Aztec clay mask, and head to bed. Daily Total: $0",2,101
"8:30 a.m. — I'm at work and go to make my oatmeal, but I only have a quarter-cup left! I supplement it with apple pie we have in the fridge at work just because. 12 p.m. — Our building is providing catered food for all the tenants today! A group of coworkers and I head downstairs for free tamales, rice, beans, nachos, and cookies. While we're there, they try to grill me about the upcoming Christmas party. I'm in charge of planning it and I made the event semi-formal, and they're annoyed about it. Oh well! I want it to be an elegant affair. When they're in charge of the party, they can decide the dress code, too. 12:30 p.m. — After eating quickly and taking a phone call, I go to a nail salon near my office. I'm also due for a pedicure, but my dad accidentally charged $250 to my card on Amazon and I'm trying to be mindful of my expenses to offset that. I contemplate paying with cash I have from earlier, but since I asked Shoe Friend to order two more pairs for me with her discount, I save it for when I'll need to pay her back. $14 5:15 p.m. — This is turning out to be an expensive day! I stop at Costco to fill up on gas before my flow yoga class at 6. $25 7:15 p.m. — I'm supposed to meet two friends from college for dinner. We haven't seen each other since the summer, and as the time to meet draws nearer, I remember why. They both flake, individually, when I'm already at the burger joint. I am so annoyed; flaking is my biggest pet peeve. I vow to never make plans with them again — some people aren't worth bending over backwards for. I still go inside and order a burger because I've been wanting to try this place for a while and I'm hungry. $6 8 p.m. — Instead of waiting until tomorrow at lunch to look for the tie again, I decide to go right now. When I get to the Macy's, they tell me they have ONE LEFT! The sales associates says it isn't worth hunting down at this location, though, and suggest that I go to their Woodlands location 60 miles away, where there are four left. I plead to St. Anthony as I search through the tie racks. I find a few good backups, but not the one I want. Being my usual stubborn self, I decide to put them back in the tie section where they belong, and I find the last tie! I am thrilled — and I end up getting a discount because of all the cancelations on Macy's part. $24 10 p.m. — Finally get home. Finding the tie offsets my annoyance with my flaky friends. I guess everything happens for a reason. I hang out with my parents for a bit, then do my nighttime skincare routine and go to bed. Daily Total: $69",3,101
"7:10 a.m. — I wake up a little later that I should. As usual, I rush get myself to work on time. 8:30 a.m. — Refill my oatmeal container with a giant packet from Costco and eat at my desk. 12 p.m. — I finally eat my Chipotle! It's still yummy. When I finish, I go to World Market to look for Christmas crackers to leave on guests' chairs as party favors at Christmas party. I don't find any, but I do get a holiday card for my boss. Next, I go to Walmart to look for the crackers, and of course they don't have them either. I am so over going to multiple places to find what I'm looking for! $5 4 p.m. — I leave work a little early to go to a networking event. I eat mini-chicken skewers and meatballs. Everything is well-planned and I meet tons of people. 7:30 p.m. — I planned to get my legs waxed after the event, but I stayed way longer than I intended and the salon is closed; that means tomorrow will be a very tight day. On my way home, I stop at a specialty store and finally find the crackers! They are WAY overpriced, even with a 20% off coupon, but I'm desperate and know I can expense them. During the drive home, I realize I left my outer jacket at the event. Ugh ... not the best way to make a good impression. I brainstorm ways to fit in picking it up tomorrow into my schedule. ($52, expensed) 8:30 p.m. — I go to the gym for a 45-minute workout. I'm religious about my yoga practice and try to go every weekday as the studio is close to my office, but not my house. I spend 25 minutes on the elliptical and then do an arm circuit. 10 p.m. — I shower and get ready for a dinner that a friend who graduated from college today is having. I missed the ceremony because of my networking event, but I promised to make it for this. The restaurant is 20 miles away and I regret saying yes, but in light of getting flaked on yesterday, I drag my exhausted self over. 12 a.m. — The dinner ends up being a good time, and the family of the graduate pays. As I leave the restaurant, one of my besties texts to say she saw my Snapchat at the restaurant and is at a hookah bar down the street! I'm beyond tired, but she's leaving to visit family tomorrow and I won't see her until the new year, so I go and hang out for about an hour. When the check comes, I offer to pitch in with the other four girls even though I was late and barely smoked. They're still students, and it's just a few bucks. No big deal. $6 1:30 a.m. — Finally home! I wash off my makeup and do a quick brightening treatment before jumping into bed. I don't want my skin to look dull after this long day. Thank god tomorrow is Friday and traffic won't be so bad. According to my calculations, I can afford to sleep in until 7:15, as opposed to my usual 7. Small mercies. Daily Total: $11",4,101
"8 a.m. — I'm the first one on my side of the office! I leisurely eat my oatmeal and read the news at my desk. 11:15 a.m. — I usually bring lunch from home every day, but this week has been an unusual one with tons of free food. I decide to continue the trend of eating outside food and get a meatball marinara from Subway. I usually eat closer to 1, but I haven't replenished my stock of office snacks, since doing so seemed pointless with the holidays right around the corner. $2 12:30 p.m. — I take my lunch break and pick up my jacket, which I thoughtlessly left behind last night. After, I have about 20 minutes left on my break, so I take a quick nap in my car. It's probably not the best habit, but sometimes when I'm really tired, I'll take a power nap in the garage. A year ago, I could go out all night and still function normally at work. Now, going to sleep after midnight turns me into a zombie the next day. 5 p.m. — I wanted to leave work a little early to have time to get ready for the evening, but my boss needs me to take care of something at half-past 4. When I finish, I leave the office and go to the salon for my waxing appointment. 6:30 p.m. — I started coming to this salon when they first opened and used an introductory Groupon. The owner continued to give me the Groupon rate even after the promotion ended, so I get my arms, legs, and Brazilian done for just $65 — including tip. I go home to shower off the stickiness and help my parents put up more Christmas decorations before I get ready. $65 9 p.m. — My girlfriend picks me up and we leave for her company Christmas party. She works at a Big Four firm, and their party is a grand affair with 3,000 people. They rent out the entire Museum of Natural Science, and there's a lot of booze, snacks, and exhibits to look at. A group of us have a blast taking pictures and indulging. 12:30 a.m. — After the party, we go out for dessert to The Chocolate Bar. I try to pay, but my ""date"" and our other friend insist I'm their guest and pay for the ice creams and milkshakes. On the way out, I buy a box of chocolate covered strawberries for my mom to offer the guests she's having over this weekend. Boxes are half-off after 8 p.m., so it's a good deal. $5 1:45 a.m. — Finally home! I take off my makeup and fall asleep right away. Daily Total: $72",5,101
"9 a.m. — I wake up a little earlier than I need to for my spin class. (They had a Black Friday sale, so this class is paid for.) Joke's on me though: Even though I woke up early, I only get to the studio right as class starts and don't have time to fill my water bottle. I always think it's so wasteful when other people spend money on water at gyms, but here I am in the same situation! My shoes are $2 and so is the water bottle. $4 12 p.m. — One of my best friends and I grab lunch at our favorite Thai place. I remember to bring my metal straws and we both drink water and get red curry. When the check comes, we both argue about who will pick it up and settle on splitting. This friend and I frequently pay for each other and never worry about paying the other back; it always comes out even in the end. $13 1:30 p.m. — I get home, prep my skin with a sheet mask, and then start straightening my hair. I can't believe my Christmas party is tonight! The cleaning lady is here, so I put away my laundry and tidy up a bit so she can vacuum the floor. 4 p.m. — I go to a friend's house to have her do my makeup. I swear, she could be a real makeup artist. She does a brown and gold smoky eye with nude lips that goes well with my dress. 5:20 p.m. — Of course, I end up running late. I meet my friend at Kroger. We try to buy balloons, but it takes too long. I keep calm and call Party City to place an order for immediate pick up. 5:45 p.m. — I finally have my ball0ons! I'm running VERY late, as I wanted to arrive by 5:45 to set everything up (the event starts at 6:15), but looks like I'll be right on time instead. I hope no one is there yet. ($17, expensed) 6:10 p.m. — Ah — people are already there! I run in with my hands full of balloons and table decorations. I ignore everyone's offers to help and have my friend set up things on one end of the table, while I do the other side. I scatter the balloons around as much as I can before the rest of the guests arrive. 6:45 p.m. — Finally, I start to relax. People are in love with the setup and I'm already getting compliments about the venue and food choices. 7:30 p.m. — I arranged to have a wine tasting before dinner. Everyone gets an individual charcuterie plate and wine flight, and they're very impressed! We have dinner from a pre-fixe menu; I order the caprese salad, short rib and mashed potatoes, and for dessert, we all have French truffles with prosecco. 10:30 p.m. — I talk with the staff and get the check to my boss, who pays for the evening. They made a mistake initially and I caught it, despite being tipsy. I wish my boss knew that! He seems super happy with everything, so I leave the venue feeling great. My friend and I consider going to Discovery Green to see the lights, but we decided it's too cold and he drives me home instead. 11:30 p.m. — I go home and sadly wash off my makeup. Wish I could keep it on forever! I jump into bed and fall asleep right away. Daily Total: $17",6,101
"9:30 a.m. — So tired still but I need to get up and help my mom get things ready for her guests. 12:30 p.m. — Guests have started coming, but my dad wants more soda, so he sends me to Kroger for Coke, Sprite, tonic water, and two avocados for my mom. I see blueberries on sale so I grab two cartons. I'll have to remember to take them to work with me tomorrow. $10 1:30 p.m. — Dad gets nervous about us running out of beer, and sends me out again. I still get a thrill out of buying alcohol and showing my ID, even though I've been 21 for a while now. I did not realize beer was so expensive. I get a 12-pack of Stella and head home. $18 4:45 p.m. — The party went well! A lot of our guests leave to go to church or get started on the week ahead. My family and I head to church, too. 7 p.m. — There were only nine strawberries in the box I got yesterday so my mom didn't put them out. I eat a few before showering and doing a deep-cleaning skincare routine to compensate for all the makeup and lack of sleep I've put my skin through this weekend. 10:30 p.m. — I pack clothes to change into tomorrow (after work, I'm going to a Rockets game) and remind myself to withdraw money at lunch to pay my friend back for my ticket. After such a hectic weekend of back to back-to-back parties and outings, I'm pooped. I watch a little Netflix while my essential oil diffuser is on, and fall asleep, dreaming of the PTO I have planned in the weeks ahead. Daily Total: $28",7,101
"7 a.m. — I'm up and out of bed to get ready for work. I down a bottle of cold water while making a piece of avocado toast and a piece of jam toast. Trader Joe's coffee brews while I eat. (Their Winter Spice Blend is to die for.) 12 p.m. — I skip the company tradition of Thai food to go to Wegmans with my coworker for hummus. We both realize we've never been to Wegmans before, and wander around in awe of its magic. There's an entire vegan aisle. (I'm mostly vegan — not careful enough at restaurants to be full-on vegan — but I am strict vegetarian!) And there's an aisle where you can make your own trail mix! I'm already in love. I buy two tubs of hummus, a two-pound bag of carrots, pretzel chips, and raspberries. When I get back, I dip some of the chips and carrots into the hummus for lunch. I also munch on blackberries from home. $15.15 2 p.m. — I run to Starbucks with my manager; we go two or three times a week. It's a good chance for me to have one-on-ones with him and learn more about the company. He recently became addicted to peppermint mochas despite saying he hates coffee, so I feel like this is a big win for me. The total is $2.39 for a grande Pike Place roast, but I have a preloaded card with gift card cash. 5:30 p.m. — On the drive home, I need to stop and get gas. I have a pretty economical Honda that I love, and filling up the tank cost will probably last between one and a half to two weeks. $19.28 6:45 p.m. — I get home from the drive. I commute to D.C. one or two times each week but my company pays for the E‑ZPass, so I don't mind it. I work a bit more while making dinner, a veggie burger on toast with corn and beets on the side. For the rest of the night, I work on freelance projects, schedule emails, and plan my Christmas gift shopping (to be done on Friday — also known as payday). Daily Total: $34.43",1,102
"8 a.m. — Got a late start this morning. First thing I do after getting ready for the day is drink a full water bottle. Mine holds 750 mL, and I usually try to drink at least three liters a day. For breakfast, I eat avocado toast and jam toast again, and brew coffee, which I'll bring to work in mason jar (inevitably burning myself during the drive). Every day, I think about buying a to-go mug, but here I am after two months, still spilling coffee on my commute. 12 p.m. — Lunch time! My lazy, running-late lunch is hummus from Wegmans and a bag of baby carrots with whatever fruit I remember to bring. I drink two more bottles of water by the end of lunch and log my intake into an app, since I'm trying to save my skin from winter. 5 p.m. — One of my coworkers leaves to buy chips at Subway. I don't want to spend money, but chips sound so good. I solemnly drink tea at my desk thinking about chips. 6 p.m. — I drive home and start working on freelance projects. I don't do them very often, but this one was too awesome to say no to, and the additional money never hurts. I hoped to make it to the gym if I finished in time, but that seems unlikely. I make dinner for the night at home, roasted sweet potato, black beans, corn, beets and salsa. I also made a serving for lunch, adding in quinoa and snap peas. I'm trying to keep my spending low during the week since I have to buy Christmas presents this weekend and take my car to the shop for an oil change. My December bonus is attached to this Friday's paycheck so it'll give me a bit of wiggle room, even though I plan to add most of it to savings. Daily Total: $0",2,102
"6:30 a.m. — This morning sucks. It's cold and dark and rainy. I walk around with blankets wrapped around me while brushing my teeth and checking Tinder. I stare at my goldfish for a while with bleary eyes and sip on the water. None of my avocados are ripe, so this morning's toast is all raspberry jam. I'm really starting to get sick of toast but I ran out of oatmeal earlier this week, which I is my usual alternate for breakfast. I get freelance work done in the morning, which is quiet and filled with coffee, and send emails from home. 12 p.m. — Lunch time. All my coworkers love eating lunch exactly at noon for some reason. I heat up my lunch from home and join them. Even though I forgot to add mango salsa to my lunch, it's extremely spicy, so I chug water at the speed of light, also throwing ice cubes in my mason jar of coffee. I spend the second part of lunch trying to figure out what maintenance my cars needs since it's close to 100,000 miles, internally hating owning a car and being an adult. 4 p.m. — Our co-working space is having a holiday party today, which means free food and booze. I graze on the vegetable plate while drinking a Corona. Initially, I grabbed spanakopita and a veggie sandwich too, but in an unfortunate chain of events, I realized the sandwich labeled vegetarian was actually turkey and had to throw it. out. I chat with my coworkers and eventually pop out, taking some of the free food home in my container from lunch. 8 p.m. — I sip on egg nog, eat the spanakopita I brought home, and watch a bit of TV before getting started on freelance work. The person I'm doing freelance work for calls and we have a good discussion about timelines. Looks like I'll make it to the gym tomorrow! It starts snowing outside, which I am about. People in Baltimore are already shit drivers, and this isn't gonna help. Daily Total: $0",3,102
"7:45 a.m. — I drive to work. Didn't have time to make any breakfast or coffee beforehand, but I drink the office coffee and later have a packet of instant oatmeal my coworker/best friend brought me after I complained about all the toast. 10:30 a.m. — I leave work to pick up my manager from the airport. The airport is only a seven-minute drive from our office so we usually leave our cars at the office building. He buys me Starbucks in exchange for the ride, so I happily sip my mocha on the way back to work. 1 p.m. — I had a presentation at noon with West Coast clients so I missed lunch. They loved what I presented though, and my manager picked up a hummus snack cup from Wawa for me when he grabbed lunch. $3.73 6 p.m. — I've been working on our website redesign and still have a ton of work to do, but I want to head home to go on a run and refresh my mind. I drive home, curse at traffic, go on a long run, and then make a sandwich. During my run, I had a moment of clarity with how I want the new website to look, and I try to get it on paper. My roommate and I have on in the background, and he seems to think it's awesome. I couldn't even tell you what happened. By the time the movie is over, it's after 10. I head up to my room, clean up a bit, and go to sleep. Daily Total: $3.73",4,102
"7:30 a.m. — It's payday! And it's bagel breakfast today. (One of my coworkers brings in bagels for everyone on Fridays.) My coworker drove us in today and we get to work by 8:15 a.m. I drink the office coffee, munch on my bagel ($3), and meet with my team about the concept I came up with last night. They love it and we spend the first half of the day trying to prove the concept and iterating on it. When we present it before noon, my CEO loves it, too. $3 12 p.m. — Since my coworker and I both got our paychecks and bonuses today, we decide to treat ourselves to lunch. We go to a hipster place that sells artisan jam because that's a thing now. My vegetarian banh mi and cup of butternut squash soup are amazing ($11.41). Would literally cry into my food if it was appropriate. I treat myself to an eggnog latte afterwards as well, because I haven't spent much money all week and am really excited about eggnog season. ($3.50) $14.91 6 p.m. — The rest of the day is pretty normal. My team works on illustrations we need for the new website concept. We have a meeting at 5 p.m. with a West Coast client that runs past 6 p.m. When we finally leave, traffic is terrible and there are about four inches of snow outside. While the snow is pretty, scraping the ice off of the car is hellish. 6:20 p.m. — During the ride home, I get terrifying text from one of my roommates, J. Our house was broken into this morning after we all left for work. He came home and saw the backdoor had been kicked through. They literally kicked through a fucking deadbolt in broad daylight. I'm stuck in traffic for another 20 minutes and anxious about how bad it will be. J. said the house was trashed. 6:40 p.m. — I get home and there's a cop sitting on my couch, cataloguing everything that was stolen. Honestly, at this point, I really just want to check on my goldfish. Ironically, they're the things I care the most about even though I won them by accident at a state fair for two bucks over the summer. (I thought the prize was a stuffed animal, but I went home with four goldfish.) I hightail it upstairs to check on them, and they're fine! I start breathing easier, although the rest of my room is in shambles. They left my computer, which was in plain sight on my desk, but they took my iPad, which was in a case in my bookshelf?? They took a fake pair of pearl earrings, too. I tell the officer what was taken, and check on my roommates' rooms. J. is the only other one home for tonight. 7:45 p.m. — The police officer leaves, and J. and I try to figure out what to do with the backdoor since the lock is broken and the doorframe is falling apart. We end up drilling planks of heavy wood over the door to blockade it. Then, we clean up our roommates' rooms a bit before going to clean our own. I put everything I own in the washer because my stuff was thrown everywhere. 8:50 p.m. — After cleaning, J. and I settle in to watch a movie and drink wine. I realize I haven't had dinner yet, and since I just got fucking robbed, I order my fave food off Uber Eats. Take that robbers. My chilaquiles ($17.12) are expensive, but whatever — they're good and I deserve it.  I've already done the math and realize what was stolen is less than my deductible, so I cut my losses. My roommates weren't as lucky and lost some pretty expensive stuff. Two of my roommates who split renter's insurance accidentally wrote the address wrong, and have been insuring the pizza place down the street. Darkly humorous, but also so shitty. We watch movies for the rest of the night, drink, and smoke. It's chill. We're not in the mood for much else. $17.12 Daily Total: $35.03",5,102
"7:30 a.m. — I'm wide awake and am not falling back asleep. I had multiple break-in nightmares that would easily work for a horror movie. In one, the robber was still in our house, sneaking around, stealing our phones when we weren't looking, and then murdering us one by one. So, yeah. Didn't sleep much and don't plan on going to go back to sleep. 8:30 a.m. — I hear someone moving downstairs and see a text from J. that the landlord is here with maintenance to fix the door. They're taking apart our handy work first, which they were surprised to see. Who wouldn't board up a broken door in Baltimore?! I make coffee and toast, while my landlord is wears sunglasses and complains about being hungover. It's too early to deal with this, so I go upstairs to take care of my house plants, which need their showers. I have a couple of big ones so it's easier to put them in my shower to water them instead of using a watering can. 12 p.m. — Maintenance finally leaves and I'm off to Target with my friend. I'm spending a little bit of my bonus on new skincare items. My sister started doing the double wash method and has been raving about it, so I'm going to try it, too. I buy the Pixi Double Cleanse face wash ($24), and a variety pack that includes their toner because they're out of the large bottles. The tester has two mud masks and tonic toner in it, too ($22). I also grab a pack of washcloths for my face so I can use a fresh one every two days ($3.99). I use my bonus money on this instead of my regular budget. $49.99 12:45 p.m. — After target, we stop in Harris Teeter to buy groceries for the week. I get raspberries, Tofurkey, corn, peas, black beans, bananas, bread, one frozen entree, avocados, hummus, and coffee for $39.87. It'll be enough to make it for the rest of the week. We're pretty hungry and stop in Chick-fil-A next door for a quick snack. I get medium fries and sweet tea ($3.55). It's pretty clutch. $43.42 3 p.m. — To wrap up the shopping trip, we drop into the liquor store. I made a bottle opener a week ago in a blacksmith class and haven't had any bottled beer to try it on. I text J., who also did the class, and asks if he wants to split. We decide to get a variety pack of Sierra Nevada because we have different beer preferences ($21.50 total split two ways). I also pick up a bottle of wine to split with my other roommate, which costs $7.45 after being split two ways. $18.20 5 p.m. — I get home and J. really wants sushi. I'm down, so we take some of the beers we just bought to a BYOB sushi place. It's awesome. I get two avocado rolls and miso soup for only $11 after tax and tip. $11 7 p.m. — Friends come over and we play poker and pregame for holiday parties we're going to later. One is fancy one, the other is ugly-sweater themed, so J. and I wear my two ugly Christmas cat sweaters with his suit jackets on top and bowties. I've got a black skirt and tights on, and he wears nice slacks. It's hilarious and we run with it. We drink beer, play games, and eventually head out. 11 p.m. — The second party runs out of alcohol and my friend wants to grab some from the liquor store down the street. I tag along; it's almost 11 so the liquor store closes in an hour, and I figure I can have one more beer. I grab a Modelo Tallboy for myself and another for J., which he pays me back for. Economical, and will take me a while to drink. When I get back to the party, it seems a lot of people know we were robbed and keep asking about it. I'm kinda over it and just stick with some of my good friends. Around 1 a.m., I head home with friends, snack on a little hummus, drink a lot of water, and go to bed. $3.45 Daily Total: $126.06",6,102
"10 a.m. — I wake up with a slight headache and put away the last load of laundry while drinking water. Around 10 a.m., I head to a coffee shop to focus on work for the rest of the day. I order black coffee and spinach and feta wrap, deciding this is the last thing I'll eat out for a while. I remember that I said I'd start writing Yelp reviews yesterday at sushi. J. said his friend brought him to a Yelp Elite event that was an open bar and buffet on a really classy boat cruise. Apparently, it was amazing. He's trying to get the same Elite status now, and we turned it into a game to see who can do it first. I write a review for the coffee shop and finish the review for the sushi place. $6.88 12 p.m. — I buy Christmas presents for my family. I split the cost of my dad's gift with my sister and brother-in-law; it's a drone that takes cool pictures since he loves nature photography ($26.40). I buy my sister two books and a card game from her wish list, and a rubber-band gun for my brother-in-law from his ($81.90). I spend the next bit of time balancing my budget. If I stick to my plan, I should save $18,000 from now until next October, which is pretty rad. Thinking about it like that, I'll make a serious dent in my student loans once I get my base savings out of the way. $108.30 5 p.m. — I spend the rest of the time finishing a freelance project I'm submitting later tonight. They're paying me a couple of grand for it, so that'll be a nice savings bump. I buy a ticket to a formal event in January for a program I'm in, make dinner at home, finish up work, and watch a movie with my roommates. After this week, I'll have $200 left until January 1 based on my budget. I decide to pull another $100 for NYE from my bonus. $40 Daily Total: $155.18",7,102
"10:30 a.m. — I get out of bed after my Emergency Don't-Sleep-Later-Than-This alarm goes off, and am uncharacteristically energetic. I slip on jeans and a t-shirt, eat a hard-boiled egg, make a pot of coffee for my thermos, brush my teeth, and head out the door. Trader Joe's is packed, even though it's before noon on a Sunday. Last night, I babysat with my best friend and she told me about a “cleanse” she recently started. The dietary restrictions and required discipline seemed too farfetched for me, but my biggest takeaway was to try cutting my sugar intake. She says that doing so has worked wonders for her skin and energy levels. I normally spend $30-35 per week on groceries, but spend a bit more today. I buy Stevia packets, avocados, green peppers, bananas, Greek yogurt, spinach, three pre-packed salads, frozen chicken breasts, chicken sausage, brie, two boxes of pasta, and frozen berries. $53.37 1 p.m. — I take the subway (my company pays for my monthly MetroCard) to the Upper East Side to meet a college friend for bagels at H&H. I spring for lox and we catch up for a while before walking a few blocks north to see ! I have a MoviePass subscription so my ticket (normally $15) is “free”! We laugh, we cry, we leave, and it's dark out because winter is coming. $11.92 4:45 p.m. — Hop on the downtown subway and instead of going home, walk into DSW. I have $140 of babysitting cash burning a hole in my wallet, and I need a new pair of boots. I spend nearly an hour perusing, but nothing speaks to me, so I leave empty-handed and walk home. I get home and am craving something sweet, so I have a few too many pretzel M&Ms. Cutting down on sugar is going really well. 8:30 p.m. — After a few hours of catching up with my roommate, watching last night's episode of on Hulu, and journaling, I finally find myself a little hungry. I make organic tomato and roasted red pepper soup! (A.k.a., I heat up Trader Joe's soup on the stove.) Daily Total: $65.29",1,103
"7:25 a.m. — I reluctantly roll out of bed after hitting snooze once and get in the shower. After, I pick my outfit for the day and put my Trader Joe's salad in my bag for lunch. I also remove a frozen chicken breast from the freezer to defrost. I'm not very hungry yet, so I consider waiting to eat breakfast until I get to work. After making a cup of green tea, chatting with the roommate after she returns from yoga (and sharing which T. Swift song is stuck in our heads — “Delicate” in mine, “Gorgeous” in hers), I get dressed and leave my apartment to take the subway into Brooklyn for work. 9:35 a.m. — I arrive, slap on a smile, make a cup of coffee from the Keurig, and raid the snack cabinet for a rice cake. I add peanut butter and honey on top. For the next few hours, I answer various emails, read a lot of tweets, and watch the number of “Articles You Have Left This Month” on  ' website go down. 1:30 p.m. — Lunch time! I work above a food court, so I take my salad and a book downstairs to the big dining area, and use my full hour to eat, read, and scroll through Instagram. 6:01 p.m. — I am OUTTA there! I'm a firm believer in leaving work when you have no more work to do, so I'm saved by the 6 o'clock bell! I take the subway home, rocking out to a Christmas playlist I made in high school, and taking a detour at the Trader Joe's wine shop. Sometimes there is a line out the door to just get in, but fortunately it's pretty quiet. I grab two bottles of pinot noir because it's Monday — and hey, maybe I'll bring one to a holiday party! (Or not.) I walk home, feeling grateful the day's over. $12.50 8:30 p.m. — Finally feeling hungry, I make chicken, green peppers, and penne after briefly catching up with my roommate before she goes to a concert. I, on the other hand, have been parked on the couch in front of since I got home. 9:30 p.m. — I'm two glasses of wine in, mindlessly swiping through Bumble (I'm newly single), and watching the hilarious . I'm also scrolling through Twitter (being a millennial is all about multitasking, isn't it?) and reading about the president's endorsement of a child molester for Alabama senator. Furious, I make a donation to Doug Jones' campaign before going to bed. $10 Daily Total: $22.50",2,103
"7:30 a.m. — Getting out of bed is so hard today. It didn't help that I was in the middle of a stress dream when my alarm went off, so I start my day in a weird mood. I hop into the shower, get out, chat with my roommate (she is the absolute best and we love each other very much!), and she leaves early so she can walk to work. I'm not very hungry, so I make a bowl of Greek yogurt with granola and a little honey before I leave. 9:40 a.m. — I get to work a few minutes late and immediately make a coffee from the Keurig. Perhaps the yogurt wasn't as filling as I thought, because the coffee goes right through me and I am jittery AF. The most exciting email I receive is an invite to go into my boss' office to pick a name for Secret Santa. I'm excited that I pick out the name of a girl I know fairly well! I brainstorm what to buy for her, feeling grateful for the $20 limit. 1:30 p.m. — A new employee joins me for lunch, and we go downstairs with our lunches from home. I have a different Trader Joe's salad today that is purely vegetables and I am nervous, but it ends up being pretty tasty and very filling! Maybe what they say about vegetables is true — that you should, like, eat them. 5:55 p.m. — My to-do list has shrunk, and I'm really excited about my evening plans. I leave the office and take the subway to the Greenwich Village. I have a major pizza craving, so I stop into Joe's Pizza but it's cash only. Double ugh: I left my wad of babysitting cash on my bedside table. I withdraw $20 (with a $2.75 fee) from the ATM outside of Joe's, and eat the most delicious slice of cheese pizza ($3) I've had in a long time. $5.75 6:50 p.m. — I walk two blocks through the rain to meet my friend at a cool Belgian beer bar. We haven't seen each other in a few weeks, so after I order a beer (she's been there for a few minutes and already has one) we quickly catch up, commiserate about work, and brainstorm festive Christmas-y things to do together. At 7:30, we realize we're running late to our big event, so we ask for the check and split the bill. I insist on paying for half of “her” fries because I definitely ate half of them. $13 8:15 p.m. — We wait outside in the pouring rain for 30 minutes before finally being let into the movie theatre to see , a short film by one of our favorite filmmakers! We are surrounded by fellow film nerds and it is glorious, and the Q&A with the filmmaker is an added bonus. Well worth the $15 I spent on the ticket I ordered two weeks ago. After the movie, we split ways and I take the subway home, chat with my roommate, and get ready for bed. Daily Total: $18.75",3,103
"7 a.m. — I'm up earlier than usual today because I have a pre-work coffee meeting at 8. I roll out of bed, change into appropriate attire, and eat a banana. Somehow this takes me 55 minutes, and I realize I'm going to be a few minutes late. So, I power walk up the street to the café where I'm meeting someone for the first time in two years; he messaged me on LinkedIn last week asking to catch up. Networking is so awkward, but it's vital in my industry. 8:15 a.m. — He is running a few minutes late, so I buy myself a coffee to end the awkward stare down I'm getting from the barista. $2.75 9:15 a.m. — The meeting goes really well! He basically tried to offer me a job interview, which was flattering. I would have liked to stay longer but I'm running quite late to work, so I head out and take the subway into Brooklyn. Once I get to the office, I resist taking a free doughnut from one of the FOUR boxes on the kitchen table, and opt to make a rice cake with peanut butter and honey. 1:30 p.m. — I'm borderline hangry after a company-wide “Investing 101” meeting. I eat lunch by myself today, and it's my last Trader Joe's salad of the week. I take my full hour, then come back upstairs with just a few emails to answer. I make a cup of tea in the office kitchen, and get back to work, which consists of emailing a few people and FedExing a couple Blu-rays. 6 p.m. — The workday is done! I take the subway into Manhattan and walk through Washington Square Park to watch the Christmas tree lighting. About 200 people are crowded around the giant tree, singing carols along with a brass band. I stay for about 10 minutes, reveling in holiday cheer, before walking to a bookstore on a mission to buy a Secret Santa gift. I spend 45 minutes wandering the aisles, and end up getting a 2018 planner for myself and a mug for my Secret Santa. $33.86 7:45 p.m. — I walk home and heat up leftover chicken from two nights ago. My roommate comes home from yoga a little after 8, and we catch up and watch together while I paint my nails. Daily Total: $36.61",4,103
"6:30 a.m. — I try to go to the gym before work at least once a week, and today's the day. Out the door at 6:45, I walk to the gym and spend about 45 minutes there. I walk home, say hey to my roommate who has the day off, and hop in the shower. 8:30 a.m. — I am running ahead of schedule for the first time since my first week at my job six months ago. I use that extra time to make a smoothie with soy milk, nonfat Greek yogurt, half an avocado, spinach, and a frozen berry medley. After one sip, I confirm that I am a smoothie genius. I take it to-go, and head to the subway. On my commute, I listen to a “Before a Difficult Conversation” meditation tape. 10:15 a.m. — I've been at work for 35 minutes, and it's time to do something I've been planning for months. I quit my job. Well, I put in my two weeks notice. But yes, I quit my first ever full-time job with (minimal) benefits and a steady salary. It is terrifying and I may have cried a little, but I am so relieved when it's over. I've freelanced in the film industry for the past four years, and while the salary ranges from $10,000-$20,000 per year, my happiness pursuing my various passions fulfills me beyond belief. I text approximately a million friends and receive a wave of congratulatory messages. I absolutely do not need coffee, because between working out this morning and quitting my job, I am feeling energetic AF. Eventually, though, the smell from the coffeemaker in the kitchen draws me in, and I give in. 1:30 p.m. — Thursdays and Fridays are generally the days I treat myself to lunch from a nearby food hall. I stroll inside with a coworker, and we decide on sandwiches. Normally, their wraps are an obscene $14, but on Thursdays, they have an $10 special on everything. Of course, I pick out the wrap that is $1 extra. After tax, my bill comes to $11.98. My coworker and I eat together and dish on my resignation. I am relaxed at lunch for the first time in months. After eating, we take a look inside the chocolate shop in the food hall. They have the cutest chocolate mini-champagne bottles that I've always needed an excuse to buy, and I decide that there's no better day than today to buy them. I pick up two ($6 each) - one for me, one for my sister, who I'm visiting this weekend. $25.05 5:30 p.m. — Everyone in the office ducks out early for a holiday party hosted by the building for all the tenants. There's loud music, dancing, and most importantly: free food and drinks. I have a white wine, a mulled wine ... another mulled wine, and two pieces of pizza. I'm skeptical this will fill me up for dinner, but it's certainly delicious. An hour into the party, I call it a night and take the subway into Manhattan. 7:40 p.m. — My roommate and I meet at our favorite Mexican place for a celebratory drink. Me quitting my job is almost as exciting for her as it is for me, because she's had to spend the last six months consoling me. I order two tacos and a Paloma, and she gets a taco salad and tequila on the rocks. We split the bill and walk home. $29.22 Daily Total: $54.27",5,103
"8 a.m. — I'm taking a mental health/work-from-home day. I love how getting up at 8 feels luxuriously late. I chat with my roommate as she gets ready for work, and I make a cup of tea, eat a banana, and take a shower. 10:45 a.m. — After reading a few emails, I walk around the corner to CVS. I pick up makeup, deodorant, toothpaste, and movie theater candy for my Secret Santa. Normally, I have a bunch of coupons, but today I'm coupon-less and paying full price. Damn. $33.12 12:10 p.m. — I'm starving and a little headachey. I realize I haven't had any coffee yet, so I make a cup from our Nespresso machine and my headache dissipates. Last night, my mom texted to say that she and my dad have a box of cookies for me at their apartment. I walk over to pick them up since they live a few blocks away from me. On my way home, I stop in Pret A Manger to buy a sandwich, as I don't have any lunch food at home. $8.15 2 p.m. — After a 30-minute work conference call, I take the bags I packed this morning and walk to the subway to get to Penn Station. I get there with about 20 minutes to spare before my train, and it's a nice change from frantically running through the station. I buy a one-way NJ Transit ticket to Philadelphia. Off to see my big sister! $26 5:30 p.m. — I get to Philadelphia, and per my sister's instructions, take a trolley to meet her at a restaurant. The trolley ticket is $2.50. The trolley system is so confusing compared to the New York subway; there is no way to know where you are because they don't announce each stop! I somehow manage to get off the trolley at the right stop, and walk across the street to meet my sister and her coworkers for dinner. Two glasses of wine and a few slices of pizza later (the four of us split the bill — $29.56 each, including tip), she and I walk back to her place. $32.06 Daily Total: $99.33",6,103
"9 a.m. — We sleep in a bit and wake up to a winter wonderland! We each have a bowl of cereal in my sister's kitchen, get dressed, and decide to walk through the snow to get coffee. When we get to her favorite coffee place, there are no seats available; looks like everyone in the neighborhood also wanted a picturesque morning! We walk a few more blocks to a vegan doughnut shop and each get a coffee. I also order a cinnamon sugar doughnut, and she orders a lemon raspberry. I pay for both of us. $9.18 10 a.m. — We make a few stops on the walk back to my sister's place, including to a little bookstore, a pet store (sooo tempted to adopt one of the kittens in the window), and her food co-op. She buys groceries so we can make lunch, and insists on paying. 2 p.m. — After we make lunch (rice, beans, and veggie stir fry) and eat a few too many of the cookies my parents gave us, we walk around the corner to watch a free choral performance in the outdoor pavilion of a gardening store. Super cool! 6 p.m. — We spend a few hours warming up in her apartment, then take the trolley ($2.50) into downtown Philly to check out a huge ice rink and winter lodge set up by the river. It is so beautiful and festive, and “All I Want For Christmas Is You” plays about three times in a row. I am in heaven. We warm up next to a fire, then walk into the most Christmas-y looking pub we can find for dinner. Feeling a cold coming on, I order a hot toddy (sister does, too) and am shocked at the low price of $7.50. “Welcome to Philly!” my loving sister taunts. I get a hamburger, she gets fish and chips, and we each get a drink called “Festive Fashioned” after our hot toddies. This spin on the Old Fashioned is a price I'm more used to, $11. Totally worth it. We split the bill. $40.70 8 p.m. — I need to buy another ride on the trolley to get home, and my sister suggests I buy two trolley tokens for $4 instead of one trolley card for $2.50 in case we ride the trolley tomorrow. I'll say it again: the Philly subway/trolley system is confusing. $4 9 p.m. — We get home after an extraordinarily snowy and festive day, and call it a night — happy to be cozy and warm together.

"8:30 a.m. — I arrived in Lisbon last night around midnight and then couldn't fall asleep until about 2 a.m. (New place, noisy street, etc.) I ambitiously set my alarm for 8:30, but immediately turn it off and fall back asleep. 11:30 a.m. — I finally wake up! Part of me wants to get out and explore the city ASAP, but I've had a busy, stressful few months, and I tell myself to chill out, wake up slowly, and have a relaxing morning. The room I have here in Lisbon seemed fine last night, and it looks even nicer in the light of day — high ceilings and big windows. I'm excited for the next few weeks! I work remotely, so for the past year, I have changed location every two months or so, and I love it! Although I prefer the term ""location independent worker,"" I think ""digital nomad"" is the trendier term for my lifestyle. 12:30 p.m. — I'm finally dressed, organized, and ready to explore! The girl I'm staying with came home LATE last night and is still asleep. I write her a quick note saying hi and then head out. I pay to hop on the subway to the Baixa district, which I believe is quite touristy. That's fine for me on day one of a new city! I plan to do a free walking tour at 3 p.m., but I want to explore a bit on my own first. The city is gorgeous — warm and sunny, full of colorful weather-worn buildings, cobblestones, and street art. $1.70 1:30 p.m. — I discover the Time Out Market and pop in. It's overwhelming, with electronic music pumping and people everywhere. I grab a pastel de nata and an espresso ($4.11) and eat standing at the counter. The pastry is AMAZING! I've never had one before and expected them to be average, but wow, I can see why everyone loves them. Afterwards, I wander down a super touristy promenade and stop to try on clothes. I am newly single after six years (ugh), so I buy a low-cut white top for future dates (eek!). $19.36 2 p.m. — T., an old friend who is on vacation in Lisbon, message me on WhatsApp to ask if I want to go to brunch at 4:30 instead of going on my walking tour. I agree, and then discover that ""Brunch"" is the name of a weekly outdoor rave. It's not my usual scene, but whatever. I need to go back home to change clothes, so I stop in the mini-market to grab food for a quick lunch. I get eggs, butter, a tomato, an onion, a crusty roll, a croissant, and a pack of gum. I'm happy with how affordable the store is, since it is the one closest to my house. I dash home, make a quick omelet with toast, and freshen up for the party. $3.99 4:30 p.m. — I meet T. at his hostel and give him €20. The ticket was only €15, so he covers a couple of beers, a shot of whiskey, and my bus fare to the rave. It turns out we are tagging along with some of the hostel employees, and it's kind of cool to hang out with native Lisboans on my first day here. It takes FOREVER to get to Brunch, but when we do, it is pretty cool: a clearing in the woods ringed with beer stands, a huge dance floor, and a DJ on a stage. People of all ages are in attendance; there is even a bounce house filled with kids. We dance for hours, and the vibe is chill. We stay until the party is over and walk out, feet aching and super hungry. $23.48 12 a.m. — In a city with so much good food, this is a super embarrassing purchase: We stop at a fast-food joint and I get a fucking cheeseburger for dinner. Boooooo. I trade a bite of my burger for some of T.'s french fries. I'm exhausted! My plan for Lisbon was lots of sleep, waking up early to do cultural activities, and a big push for sales at my day job. So far, things are not going according to plan... $4.10 12:30 a.m. — Google tells me that the bus will take over 40 minutes to bring me home, so I opt for an Uber. My driver is pretty friendly (although he also seems stoned), and he tells me a bunch of places I need to visit. I'm all ears! Usually, I enjoy researching locales before I arrive, but I have been so busy that I haven't time to look into Lisbon at all. I get home, and my flatmate is there! We finally get to meet in person. We chat for a little bit; she is cool and easygoing, and it seems that we will have opposite schedules, which is good and bad. I wash my face, brush my teeth, and fall into bed. $8.22 Daily Total: $60.85",1,104
"8:30 a.m. — Alarm rings. I shut it off without a second thought and go back to sleep. This pattern has to stop, but today is not the day. 12 p.m. — I'm finally up and out of bed! I think my long day yesterday plus lingering jet lag knocked me out. I'm starving and have to be on a work call at 2 p.m., so I Google nearby coffeeshops with food. I get dressed and walk about a mile to a gorgeous lookout point. After admiring the view, I walk into a very traditional looking café with dark wood paneling, dusty liquor bottles, and elderly people sipping espressos. The barista is blasting Metallica, though, as I order a spinach and couscous salad, and a café Americano, answer emails, and hop on the call. After I'm done, I have a moment of panic — the café doesn't take foreign cards and I've left my cash at home! The proprietor isn't fazed and tells me to come back with the money when I can. I offer to leave collateral, but he won't take anything. ""We trust you,"" he says. I thank goodness for kindness and rush home. 3:30 p.m. — I walk the mile back home, grab cash, walk another mile back to the café and pay for my meal. The total comes out to about $8, but I leave $11.74 as a thank you. (Tipping in cafés is customarily 0%-5% here.) As I walk back to my house, I realize I have already walked over four miles today. In light of that fact, I stop and purchase a box of pastries to eat when I get home. For $4.07, I get two pastels de nata, four long crunchy butter cookies, and two large square butter cookies dipped in chocolate. Yum! Once I get home, it's right to work. $15.81 8 p.m. — I snack on an apple and a few of the cookies as I continue to work. I am meeting T. for dinner at 9:30, but I'm starving now. Having a friend who is on vacation here has definitely increased my spending and disrupted my schedule this week, but the tradeoff is worth it. Working from this house is nice — there is a pretty balcony and the Wi-Fi is fast — but it sure is loud; screaming babies, conversations in all sorts of languages, motorcycles speeding by. I love it! 12:30 a.m. — I end up being very busy at work today, but it pays off with a sale that is 25% of my annual goal! Because of that, I'm late to leave for dinner and opt for an Uber instead of the 35-minute walk. I meet T. at a tiny seafood place in Chiado. It is adorable, and we share a cheese plate, garlic shrimp, fantastic octopus, and a bottle of amazing, dry white wine. I pay $29.35 for my half. T. and I both coached MMA at the same gym and we go back about 10 years. We talk shit about our exes and exchange gym gossip as we eat. After, we meet up with folks from his hostel and drink €1 beers at a lovely mirador overlooking the city. At midnight, I decide I need to get home, and I Uber once more. I'm conscientious of how much money I'm spending, but I think it's worth it to spend time with an old friend. The song ""Wonderful World"" comes on as I ride home, and I feel lucky and grateful. $44.80 Daily Total: $60.61",2,104
"8:30 a.m. — Alarm sounds at 8:30 a.m. I shut it off but still manage to be up and about by 10 a.m. I'm not hungry, but I make an egg with toast and tomatoes and eat it anyway so that I don't buy breakfast out. I'm visiting the National Tile Museum today (I love tile!) and then plan to wander a bit and grab lunch somewhere pretty. 12 p.m. — The museum isn't too far, so I decide to walk so I can see more of the city. At the museum, I pay admission; there are lots of beautiful azulejos on display, as well as cool temporary exhibits by Japanese ceramic artists celebrating the relationship between the two countries. I have worked in the tile industry for most of my career, and I love seeing how old materials like these continue to influence contemporary tile trends and aesthetics. $5.90 1 p.m. — I hop on a bus ($2.30) to one of the high streets and disembark about 15 minutes later. In between taking photos of street art, yellow trams, and beautiful tile, I pop into a clothing shop called Bershka. I liked a skirt I saw there the other day, but they didn't have my size. Luck is on my side, because they do have the skirt, and it fits perfectly! I try to only buy clothes if they fill a big hole in my wardrobe, and this knee-length, pleated skirt definitely does ($29.49). $31.79 2 p.m. — I stop by a cute café for lunch. The man behind the counter is stern, and I panic order a pastry and a coffee because I feel rushed. Once I have collected myself, I return to the counter and ask for a vegetable soup. After I'm done, I get a second coffee and sip it as I spend time editing a few photos to post on Instagram, answering work emails, and WhatsApping with different groups of friends. $4.80 3 p.m. — I catch the subway back to my neighborhood and set myself up on the balcony with my laptop and a big glass of water. Lisbon has some of the steepest hills I've ever seen, and all the walking has made me thirsty. My company's offices are closed today for a meeting, so I get a lot of stuff coming my way from clients who can't reach their usual salesperson. I'm happy to help out my colleagues since being busy makes the time fly. I continue to message friends from home. It feels nice to stay in the loop even though I am far away. $2.30 7:30 p.m. — My cash is running low and the ATMs are being a little temperamental with my card, so I want to conserve what I have. I buy garlic naan from the chicken restaurant next door and make scrambled eggs with tomato and onions. My flatmate gets home, and we chat about the economy in Portugal, the high cost of education in the States, and our recent breakups. After, I log back on to finish my last three hours of work. I'll try to be in bed by midnight tonight. $1.77 Daily Total: $46.56",3,104
"8:30 a.m. — I gave up hitting snooze and turned off my alarm before bed last night; this morning, I wake up at 8:30 on the dot without it! T. and I text about going to the beach, but I decide not to since the trip would make my day too hectic. I sit in bed for a while longer, browsing on my Kindle for a new book and enjoying the fresh air and the sounds coming from the street below. 11 a.m. — First order of business is to get cash. Thank goodness the ATM closest to my house decides to accept my card! I decide to go to Carmo Convent (the remnants of a Gothic cathedral that was partially ruined in an earthquake), and purchase a round trip subway ticket ($3.35). The entrance fee is $6, and the convent is beautiful! There are a bunch of South American artifacts and two Peruvian mummies inside, and I wonder about the ethics of these cultural objects being in Portugal. I have a friend who specializes in antiquities trafficking (working against it, not for it!), and I tell myself to ask her for her opinion later. $9.35 12 p.m. — The back of the convent opens up into a patio with a gorgeous view of the city. There is a café there that looks so tempting. I assume it is a tourist trap, but I look it up online and the reviews aren't bad. They are playing Buddha Bar on the radio, there is a seat in the shade, and the view is amazing, so I decide to stay. I order an Americano and tomato bruschetta. I mostly admire the view, but I also email my mom some of my photos from the trip and send them to a WhatsApp group chat with friends. It is so relaxing. $10.65 1:30 p.m. — It's such a pretty day that I don't want to work, but I must. I use the subway card I bought earlier to get home. I have a sweet tooth, so I stop and pick up fruit from a street vendor: three clementines, two pears, and a mango. I set myself up on the patio with water and the clementines, and by 2 p.m., I'm making phone calls and answering emails. $1.75 5 p.m. — I'm starving and pop down the street to pick up a rotisserie chicken. The chicken place is closed, and the next three cafés I visit have all finished with food service for the day. I'm getting desperately hungry and I need to make work calls. I grab my laptop and walk 20 minutes to the café where I had the couscous salad the other day and order the same thing. I sit down and try to settle in, but one minute later, a huge, noisy tour group is led in by a guide. Le sigh. I guess today won't be as productive as I hoped. I kick myself for not planning better. $8.89 6:45 p.m. — The café wasn't so bad in the end. The group only stayed about 15 minutes, and I had a nice chat with the guide. On my way home, I stop by a lookout point and watch the sun set. There is a girl with a guitar singing songs in Portuguese, and lots of people hang around drinking beers; it is really nice. I buy a savory chicken pastry and a pastel de nata to eat as I head home to finish work. $2.43 9:30 p.m. — I cut out of work at 9:30 to go to a Couchsurfing party at a little outdoor bar near Time Out. I've never used Couchsurfing as a travel resource before, but I've heard their events are fun, and this one totally is. It's a few, casual hours of meeting new and friendly people from all over the world and a lot of locals. Being from D.C., I was worried that everyone would want to talk politics with me but no one did, thank god. T. ended up stopping by as well, and we both had a great time. I took the metro there ($1.40), but had to Uber back home ($6.27). I bought two small beers for myself (€1 each!) and a large one for T. in exchange for some of his cigarettes ($4.60). I make it back home around 1:30 a.m., happy, relaxed, and ready for bed. I chat with some of the girls online and then pass out. $12.27 Daily Total: $45.34",4,104
"9 a.m. — I wake up fairly early considering how late I stayed out last night. I eat a pear from my fruit stash and drink water. I planned to spend the day relaxing at home and reading my book, but my mind keeps drifting toward my ex. If I stay here alone, it will just turn into a pity party, so I get dressed and get ready to go out. 12 p.m. — There is a café I keep hearing about called Tease. It is a little inconvenient to get to, but I decide it is a perfect destination for today since I didn't plan on accomplishing anything else anyway. I take the subway ($1.40) and walk about 20 minutes to get there. When I arrive, it is adorable! Shabby-chic decor, nice music, hip people working on laptops. I order an Americano and a veggie burger ($11.86), then sit for awhile and read. The food is great, and I am stuffed. I walk to a lookout point nearby and enjoy the view, then head back home to read my book for a bit before work. Pity party successfully avoided. $13.26 4 p.m. — I have therapy today, and I have really been looking forward to it. We missed last week because of an issue with my insurance, and I have a lot I want to talk about. Since I travel so much, I use an app to meet with my therapist online via video chat. Talking to a professional really helps me sort out my thoughts and emotions, and I wish it was accessible to everyone. This visit costs $95, but is entirely paid for my by health insurance. Afterwards, I eat the last pear and get back to work. 6 p.m. — I enjoy eating out a lot my first few days in a city, and I consider it part of exploring a new place. But now that I've been here almost a week, I need to get serious. I do my first big grocery trip and get coffee, chicken breast, dried pasta, couscous, a can of tuna, a small carton of béchamel sauce, a tomato, goat cheese, rice cakes, mushrooms, broccoli, a can of Coke, a bottle of wine, eggs, a crusty roll, a pastel de nata, garlic, raspberries, muesli, Greek yogurt, soap, and dental floss. Once I get home, I snack on the goat cheese, tomato, and a rice cake. I throw together pasta with chicken, mushrooms, broccoli, onions, and garlic, and make a white wine and béchamel sauce. The neighbors are blasting Eminem; so much nostalgia for me! I finish my last few hours of work and snack on the pastel de nata. I don't consider myself a very good cook, but I like the food that I make, and it feels good to eat some of MY food again. $31.97 9 p.m. — My roommate comes home, and we sit on the patio for a few hours drinking wine and chatting. We get a craving for something sweet and put goat cheese and honey on top of rice crackers. At 2 a.m. the neighbors yell at us for playing music too loudly, so we head to bed. Daily Total: $45.23",5,104
"10 a.m. — Ugh. I sleep late and wake up feeling sick from all the heavy food yesterday (a fried veggie burger and huge plate of pasta). Instead of eating breakfast, I drink two cups of coffee at home. I'm getting dinner with T. tonight, so I start work a few hours earlier than usual in order to finish up in time. 1:30 p.m. — After a few hours of work, I shower, get dressed, and finally have an appetite. I eat a bowl of Greek yogurt with raspberries and muesli. I thought the yogurt was plain, but it turns out to be vanilla flavored, which is a fantastic surprise! 4:30 p.m. — After snacking on rice cakes with goat cheese and tomato, I decide to make actual lunch — diced mushrooms, potato, and onion with two eggs and bread. I also contact my realtor about a condo I see for sale online in my hometown. I've been looking to buy a rental property to bring in extra income, and this place seems perfect! She agrees, and I get the ball rolling with my lender! Afterwards, I get a craving for something sweet; I drink the can of Coke I bought yesterday. 9 p.m. — I log out of work, change clothes, and head to T.'s neighborhood on the subway ($1.40). We go to a little place around the corner from his hostel that is famous for their octopus rice! We get the rice, squid, fresh cheese, bread, and a bottle of wine; everything is amazing. ($25.55) As we are finishing up, a group of people from his hostel show up with beers. We all sit around talking for awhile, then head to a pastry shop to buy dessert. ($1.20) Meanwhile, I sign off on an offer letter for the condo! Woohoo! I've been interested in creating multiple income streams for awhile, and this unit seems like a great opportunity. We end up on a street full of young people, drinking beers and socializing. I manage to make it home on the last subway train of the night. ($1.40) I call my mom and dad to tell them about the condo, then fall asleep around 2 a.m.! $29.55 Daily Total: $29.55",6,104
"11 a.m. — I wake up late after my late night out. I normally only have three or four drinks a month, so this week has done a number on my body, and I resolve to calm down a little with the wine. I make coffee and eat yogurt, muesli, and raspberries on the patio, and read a bit of my book. I message with T. since we are going to the beach later today, but there is no rush to get going. 1:30 p.m. — I pick up T. up at his hostel. The guy who works there tries to play a ""hilarious"" joke on me by pretending that T. checked out a few days ago. I might have fallen for it if I hadn't been messaging with T. all morning. We hop on the train to the beach. It's a really cloudy day but still feels warm enough to lay out. $3.24 2 p.m. — We arrive, and the beach is so pretty! It's sandy and big, with small waves and a few sailboats in the distance. We stop and grab ham and cheese croissants, and I get an espresso before heading over to lay out our towels. We people-watch and chitchat for a few hours, and I message back and forth with my realtor about the property. The selling agent is being super slow getting us the documents we need, which gives me time to second-guess, freak out, and overanalyze my decision. Luckily, my realtor is also a friend who doesn't mind having to do a bit of handholding. $2.19 5 p.m. — We really didn't plan this beach day very well as far as snacks are concerned. I need to use the restroom, so I buy a tuna sandwich at a nearby café for us to split. As the sun sets, T. listens to music and I take a call to catch up with a girlfriend living in Cairo. It is absolutely gorgeous, but we plan to come back again tomorrow when it is supposed to be sunnier. $4.49 8 p.m. — We walk to meet some folks at the Time Out food hall for dinner. It is pricy and tourist-trappy, but some of T.'s friends want to go. I debate getting a snack here and then eating dinner when I get home, but I get hangry and just go for it. I get seafood rice and a glass of white wine, and the food is delicious, but very rich ($15.12). Afterwards, they head to a bar to watch soccer, and I go home to review and sign my offer letter on the condo! ($1.40 metro) $16.52 Daily Total: $26.44",7,104
"7:45 a.m. — I wake up 30 minutes before my alarm because my dog is restless. I decide to grab leggings and a sweater and take her out before getting ready. Later, I make the bed, wash my face, and do my three-minute makeup routine (foundation, concealer, curl eyelashes). Luckily, most Catalan women don't wear makeup, so I won't stand out for doing the minimum. 8:35 a.m. — Bike to the train and skip my usual pastry stop today. I've got yogurt at the office and the train takes an hour door to door. (I buy an unlimited metro pass quarterly, but only use it to go to work on the train since I bike everywhere else.) I hate the commute, but watch on my phone and zone out. 9:30 a.m. — At the office, I grab coffee with milk. The coffee is free, but I upgrade to organic and share with a colleague. This week is my turn to pay, $1.50 for the liter. When I'm done, I grab  yogurt and add a spoonful of black-cherry-and-dark-chocolate jam from France, a gift from family friends I hosted a few weeks ago. $1.50 1 p.m. — Starving! I spent the morning preparing analytics and weekly reports for my CEO and checking in with my team. It went quickly while I listened to ""Your Release Radar"" on Spotify. I grab some of my team members and head up to the canteen-style restaurant my work pays for at lunch. The food is always lukewarm and never great, but it's free. I grab disappointing potatoes, a grilled chicken breast, overcooked broccoli, a sparkling water, and two tiny, chocolate-covered profiteroles. Sometimes I think about bringing my own food, but I'd lose the interaction with my colleagues and would spend more money. I'm back at work within 35 minutes. ($10 expensed) 2:30 p.m. — It's someone's birthday, and there's a tradition that the person whose birthday it is brings breakfast pastries. They show up after lunch, but they smell like preservatives and are presented in boxes lined with plastic sheets. I pass and get back to work. 7 p.m. — Whoops! It's 30 minutes past when I should have gone to get my dog. I leave a few things for the morning, slap on the noise-cancelling headphones, and head for the train. My dog has a knee injury right now, and I know she's going to be a handful. 9 p.m. — I have leftover butternut-squash-and-ricotta filling that I made on Sunday afternoon, so I whip up a batch of fresh pasta and roll out sloppy tortelloni. When you know how to make it, it goes pretty fast and is satisfying. I make a small salad with radish, fennel, and lettuce, and while I'm cooking, my boyfriend shows up unexpectedly to join. After dinner, I squeeze in 30 minutes of yoga. 10 p.m. — It's the last hours of Cyber Monday in the States, and I'm headed back for the holidays. I stock up on some of my favorite skincare items I haven't found here, and order a couple of toners from Boscia at a discount. I'm tempted to pick up stuff from Herbivore, but I'm on a tight budget to pay off my credit debt, and I resist since I'm not 100% out of the products yet, and it's only 25% off. $46.95 10:30 p.m. — Last dog walk of the night. I live in the pedestrian historic center and the Christmas lights are already out. They're strung to one of my balconies, in fact. I think about how rent in my neighborhood has gone up 40% in three years, and hope my landlord doesn't raise my rent. I also buy chocolate Häagen-Dazs ice cream in a moment of weakness. I get home and am asleep by midnight. $8 Daily Total: $56.45",1,105
"7:45 a.m. — I hit snooze for 10 minutes. I finally get up and do my skincare routine and makeup; I usually shower at night. I don't have to be to work as early today, so I take the pup to our favorite coffee place where she can socialize a bit; she's still not allowed to exercise due to her knee injury. I order two six-ounce flat whites, but use my prepaid card. (It's five coffees for €10 euros, about $12, instead of €2.50 to €3 each.) 10 a.m. — I arrive at work, caffeinated, and grab a yogurt before sitting down to go through email and organize my day. Amazingly, my calendar isn't full of meetings, so I might be able to check off looming tasks on my to-do list. Looks like it will be a good day at work. 1 p.m. — So hungry! At the company canteen again, but I decide to get a 'full meal' today instead of a single plate and pay an extra €1.60 for it. I get fideuà (the Catalan version of paella, but with noodles instead of rice), pork cutlet with vegetables, and a baked apple. My neck is killing me from being at my desk, and I resist booking a massage. $2.15 4:40 p.m. — Need to walk around a bit, so I run down three double-flights of stairs to grab a Kit Kat and back up again. $1 7 p.m. — Made it home and boyfriend is already there visiting with my dog. I kick him out for a bit and do 35 minutes of yoga to unwind after being at my desk. I sit on a ball at work, but it's not enough to avoid serious pain in my thoracic spine. Later, I heat leftover pulled pork with a scoop of polenta and steamed cabbage with carrots. I make fried rice with carrots and cabbage for my boyfriend, who isn't feeling well. 11 p.m. — After we take a nice, calm walk with the pup, I browse the J.Crew sale but don't find anything compelling. We go to bed for the night; my boyfriend will take dog out in the morning so I can sleep in 30 minutes longer. Sweet, sweet sleep. Daily Total: $3.15",2,105
"10 a.m. — I was up and out the door by 8:45 a.m. today. I grab my usual office breakfast, then dig into my email. I chat with a few other team leaders at our coffee bar about an upcoming organizational meeting. 1 p.m. — I'm starving and spent the last 10 minutes zoned out staring at my dog on the webcam. Head to the company canteen for a lackluster lunch: cold, gray, overcooked cauliflower, weird chicken breast, and watery rice pudding. I can't bring myself to pay out of pocket for something else right now; maybe that'll change if I secure the $20,000 raise I'm after in the next three months. 5 p.m. — My neck is killing me, and I need to get up and walk around. I'm also hungry — another sugar low. I grab vanilla flan (which is sadly tiny, like three ounces) from the café downstairs and use my members' card for a discount. $1.20 6:15 p.m. — Right before I leave work, I take care of Amazon orders that are being delivered to my parents' home for pickup over the holidays. I get biodegradable poop bags for the pup (they aren't a thing here in Barcelona, so I order 270), pure pine incense (no artificial stuff), and two plush dog toys for her to play with over the holidays. I take advantage of the exchange rate, which is in my favor. $39.81 7:30 p.m. — I meet an ex-colleague and friend at a bar near my house, dog in tow. It's cozy and warm inside, and I order a glass of tempranillo while I wait. We end up having another glass, and two tapas, Mahón cheese with membrillo (quince paste) and olives, and pan cristal. I coached him through getting a new job offer recently, which raised his pay 80%, so he treats me — and reveals that a baby is on the way. 9:30 p.m. — Boyfriend meets me at home and eats leftovers. He bought fresh chestnuts, and we cook them in a cast-iron pan; it's one of our favorite winter activities. We've been debating breaking up for two months, and tonight we end up getting into an argument. We've been together a year and a half, and he moved out of my place six weeks ago. Since then, we've been trying to patch it up. He goes home, and I'm actually pretty happy to have my place to myself. I curl up with the dog and breathe because I'll be able to sleep in a little tomorrow; I've negotiated starting at noon on Thursdays. I'm thinking of hitting up boxing and yoga, but I'll probably end up sleeping. I'm asleep by 11:30. Daily Total: $41.01",3,105
"9 a.m. — I hit snooze from 8 a.m. onwards, and finally rise at 9 because a friend I usually meet at my favorite coffee shop is almost there. I get ready fast and take the pup out to meet my friend. I've prepaid for coffee already, and enjoy a flat white while chatting. 12 p.m. — I decide to work from home today. I shouldn't, but I really need a day without two hours on the train, and my boss is in Madrid. I take the opportunity to run errands around the neighborhood and pick up panettone for the weekend from a nice bakery ($30). When I get home, I order new linen sheets from Latvia on Etsy ($214.97) because my bottom sheet is totally full of holes. I also get two containers of cocoa-lavender dry shampoo ($34.50 for two) from my favorite Etsy store, which I ship home to the States. The two containers will last me most of next year. $279.47 2 p.m. — I make leftovers for lunch, and I'm happy to not be at the company cafeteria. Orange-cinnamon pulled pork, carrots, and cabbage, along with a plain yogurt. I see that my paycheck came through, so I pay my rent on my phone. 5:30 p.m. — I gave the dog walker the day off because I'm home today, even though I pay him in-full at the beginning of each month. I take the pup out again and swing by my waxing place to make an appointment for later in the month, then stop at the restaurant where my company is dining tomorrow for our holiday dinner. I want to make sure all the details are buttoned up, but no one is there yet. 7:30 p.m. — I get a facial and a 30-minute neck-and-shoulder massage at my social club and gym ($165). I need it badly and don't feel bad about treating myself because last month I lived on about €400 due to a big tax payment that was due. My work operates on a Spanish schedule of 14 payments per year, so I'll receive two paychecks this month and all will be fine. I'd prefer the cash every month because I lose the opportunity to invest it this way, but as they say in Spanish, ""es lo que hay."" $165 10 p.m. — That was so what I needed; my esthetician is awesome, tiny, and French, and she gave me an incredible drainage massage of the face and neck. I'm home and not hungry so I wash my hair, water the dog, and hit the hay. Fridays start extra early here, as most companies do an intensive schedule — 8 a.m. to 3 p.m. — so it's important that I get to sleep early. Plus, tomorrow is our company holiday dinner! Daily Total: $444.47",4,105
"6:45 a.m. — I slept well! Could use more, but my shoulders and neck feel way better. I'm up, dressed and out with the dog. It's cold! I make a mental note to grab gloves for my commute. I bike to the train. 7:45 a.m. — I buy a new three-month train pass since the old one expired. It's the first of the month, I haven't even paid my dog walker yet, and my account is below €1,000. I planned it that way until my extra salary payment comes in this month, but it still stresses me out. 11 a.m. — There's leftover carrot cake from someone's birthday yesterday, so I grab half a slice. I drank two coffees earlier this morning and ate the rest of my yogurt and jam. Maybe I'll eat yogurt next week, too, and save the €1.35/day I usually spend on a palmier half-dipped in chocolate. A few minutes later, I'm still hungry so I grab chicken curry with rice from the prepared food shop downstairs; no lunch is provided on Fridays since we work a short day. $2.50 2 p.m. — My back and neck are killing me again, so I hole up in a conference room with a high table to change it up. Only an hour or so left, and I have my afternoon free; then, later, there's the company dinner in my neighborhood. (I volunteered to help organize it this year so that I could ensure dinner was near my home.) I check on my dog using the webcam; she hasn't moved. My boyfriend promised to take my pup out for another walk around 11 but never showed up. It's typical for him to be late. When I ask him if he's getting her or not, he starts a fight with me. I ask him if he'll be home later so that I can get my keys back. He insists on dropping them off at my house instead, now. I think it's really over. 4 p.m. — I get home and clean the house. I feel really tired and hope the dinner tonight energizes me. I had too many carbs this afternoon while cleaning — a piece of fresh bread and two candied chestnuts I picked up at an Italian specialty shop on the way home — and I'm now in a sugar low. Wish I had time to work out. $7.13 8 p.m. — One of my employees swings by my place on her way to the restaurant, and we walk over together. I bring a great bottle of wine I've been saving from from a small winery in California and crack it open for the early-comers, my CEO included. It's a nice cocktail hour, and we don't end up sitting down until 9:30 for dinner because some key people are running on Spanish time. Right before the main course, I zip out to my house (four minutes away) and grab my dog to join us. She is a total ham and works the room like a pro! 2 a.m. — That was such a great night! People loved the restaurant I suggested, and the staff did an amazing job of taking care of nearly 30 people at once. It was really special. Two people ducked out early, but everyone else stayed until 1:30, at least! Pup is exhausted. I'm pretty hammered, but I still manage to take my makeup off before slipping into bed. Daily Total: $9.63",5,105
"10:30 a.m. — I'm awake, but the dog is not. I rouse her because we have a vet appointment today to check on her injured knee and take care of other small things. I grab a flat white on the way ($2.70) from a new café around the corner I hadn't tried yet. My favorite coffee place is closed on the weekends, so it's a good opportunity. At the vet, we have the exam ($17.80); she's healing well, but needs two more weeks of rest. I pick up her preventative monthly meds ($41.60). $62.10 1 p.m. — A hangover is really setting in, but the market closes at 3 today and won't be open tomorrow, so I head out to pick up the week's groceries. I drop my recycling in the bins and pick up cash to pay my dog walker for this month. (Less than normal, $135 this month, since we're traveling some and have some bank holidays.) At the market, I pick up a whole chicken ($11.84); a piece of organic steak to use in a vegetable stir fry ($9.50); eggs ($2.85 for six); a small piece of goat cheese ($2.21), and plain yogurt ($2.08 for four). I already have all the veggies I need at home from my bimonthly farm box that arrived last week, which is usually €26 or about $30. $28.48 3 p.m. — In a moment of weakness, I take the pup and get a burger from a good spot nearby. My hangover is demanding it. Thankfully, it's fairly easy to find a good hamburger in Barcelona, while I can't say the same for the rest of Europe. The line is horrendous, but they know me and sneak my order through the pickup line. I take it home to eat and get ready to meet a friend in another neighborhood. $10.10 4 p.m. — I grab my bike and cruise to the neighborhood of Sant Antoni to meet a friend I haven't seen in a while. We get a tea ($1.78) and chat, and make our way to an artisanal fermentation shop that opened recently. I buy lacto-fermented veggies, their house ""live"" olive mix, and a big kombucha to sip on this week ($30.05). My stomach has been really weird and bloated lately, and I'm trying to incorporate living foods into my diet again. I used to make the stuff myself when I lived in San Francisco but don't have a good set up for it in my tiny kitchen. $31.83 7:30 p.m. — A friend pops over before an ""Eat Art"" dinner she's going to nearby. I'm still off alcohol and on kombucha. I make my friend a vermouth with live olives, and we chat for an hour about our recent breakups. I'm exhausted, and when she leaves I take the pup for a final evening walk and am in bed by 9:30. It takes forever to fall asleep because my central heater broke on Friday, and the space heater isn't cutting it. Landlord says he's on it Monday morning. Daily Total: $132.41",6,105
"8:45 a.m. — I'm tired, but can't sleep more; it's freezing in my apartment. I decide to venture out with the pup. We head to the park, and I let her sniff everything since she still can't go off leash or run; vet's orders. After half an hour, we make our way to the best bakery around, and I have a café con leche and a mascarpone croissant. As I pay, I see several missed calls from my ex. I call him on my way home, and he asks to see me. I agree to meet him mid-afternoon to walk the dog, so he can visit with her, and we can avoid being in my house. $4.75 11 a.m. — Time to cook for the week! My friend E. pops over with ingredients I've forgotten, and refuses to let me pay for them. We make chicken tikka masala, chicken stock (which I freeze to use later for soups, risotto, polenta, etc.), and a beef-veggie stir fry. We eat some of the stir fry, take the dog for a walk, and pick up dessert while we're out (tiramisu and carrot cake, €3 each). She pays and leaves around 1. I send her home with a portion of the chicken tikka masala. 2 p.m. — Pup and I head out to meet the ex for a walk. It's a hard couple of hours, and we almost walk away from each other a few times. I don't typically argue, but he has really brought it out in me. He is Portuguese, and there are definitely differences in our communication. On the way back towards the neighborhood, we each buy pizzetta at a new Italian place that opened on my street. The pizzetta is okay and gives me the carbs I was craving after a beef-and-veggie only lunch. We part ways with a hug, but he's been crying off and on. I always loved that about him — that he's never been afraid to let his emotions surface. I never met his mom, but I imagine she's a good woman. I head home around 4 and snuggle the pup, trying to get warm. $1.18 7:15 p.m. — Ex texts me and asks if he can stop by the house a few minutes. I think about it for a while and eventually agree, with the stipulation that if he gets angry or upset, he has to take a walk immediately, and that he needs to bring over a space heater to help warm my place up. He shows up around 8, and I make pasta puttanesca with groceries I already have: good quality spaghetti, the last of the jarred fancy tuna from my company's Christmas basket gift, the last of the anchovies, the last of the capers, and the last of the tomato paste. There's more crying, but we part on good terms and he seems to have more clarity now. I'm his first girlfriend ever, and he's 30, so I find myself having to be pretty clear about what I expect to be different moving forward. 10:30 p.m. — Ex leaves and takes the cozy heater with him. I wash my hair and crawl into bed by 11:30. Daily Total: $5.93",7,105
"7 a.m. — Panic at the time and jump out of bed. Usually, I'm not a morning person, but I slept fitfully, aware of a big, looming morning deadline looming. Now, it's go, go, go. I throw the kettle on for pumpkin spice tea; it's a fall flavor that's more meh than it sounds, but I want to finish up the box. Then, I jump in the shower. 7:45 a.m. — Text back and forth with a friend to nail down the accommodations for our post-New Year's Trip to Flores, Indonesia — where the Komodo dragons live! There are three of us, but only double rooms are available in the place we're eyeing. We agree that I'll tentatively book a double room for four nights while she explores other options. $221.22 8:15 a.m. — Realize I haven't booked my flight to Flores from Bali. It'll take two minutes (I had them saved) so I fix that. This is a small getaway from our main trip, which is to Bali, but I bought those tickets weeks ago using miles. After, it's heads down on deadline. $182.68 10:15 a.m. — Hit send with a sigh of relief. Get dressed and walk 20 minutes to the subway. When I moved here a few months ago, I was so taken with my apartment that I didn't thoughtfully factor in my commute. I'm mostly okay with my decision, but a 20-minute walk still feels long on New Yorker time. 11:30 a.m. — The first thing I do when I get to the office is find an empty room and call a senior manager I recently worked with. She complained to my boss about a slip-up on my team and considers me responsible, so here I am, steeling myself for an ""adult"" conversation. She warms up once she realizes this is an call, not a call. Another sigh of relief for the day. 12 p.m. — For the rest of the work day, I attend an internal workshop on cannabis banking and legislation (consulting's latest ""green field,"" pun intended). A pre-workshop lunch is provided, which is great since I forgot breakfast; I eat half of a sliced pork and apple sandwich before losing interest, and drink my watery mocha latte. The discussion is brisk and fascinating, and the audience is one of the most demographically diverse I've seen in my firm. Color me impressed. 6:30 p.m. — The workshop ends with a drinks reception. I help myself to a half glass of wine and a few prosciutto-wrapped dates before leaving, and then swing by Zara on my way to the subway. I'm looking for a new pair of black jeans but walk out with a black sweater. Everywhere I turn, there are crushed velvet and sparkly dresses; it's starting to feel a lot like Christmas. $22 8:15 p.m. — Pick up a few groceries at the supermarket next to my apartment building — pita bread, crackers, blackberries, black sesame ice cream. $15.50 9:45 p.m. — I made the mistake of opening a work email as I got in the front door, and then another mistake in deciding to respond. ""It'll only be a quick edit"" turned into an admittedly fun document redesign. Decide to pull myself out of the flow to get personal work done, mainly because it's my only free weeknight this week, thus, my only night for adulting. I make myself a Dark and Stormy, text my sister, eat a pita pocket filled with hummus and half an avocado, and prep salads for the next two lunches: kale, baked chicken strips, avocado, and beets. After that, I slap on a clay face mask, pick out work outfits for the next two days, organize my socks and tights, and pack up online shopping returns that I keep putting off. Isn't adulting sexy? 1 a.m. — Listen to a string of voice messages from a friend in London and then tuck myself into bed. Daily Total: $441.40",1,106
"8:15 a.m. — Drift awake and panic because I should have been up an hour ago. Drink some lemon water (I recently decided to keep a jug in the fridge), shower, and get dressed. Good thing I had my work outfit laid out. 8:42 a.m. — Grab an Uber to the subway and jump on the express train; expense it to work. I could technically expense an Uber straight to the office today (I'm guest-presenting to a global working group) but experience has shown me that the express subway is more reliable than morning traffic in midtown. ($7.25 expensed) 9:20 a.m. — Get to the office with time to spare before my presentation. I make a coffee (hazelnut creamer, yesss) and find a granola bar in the depths of my bag. 9:30 a.m. — Showtime. My presentation goes over well, and I'm invited to join the next working session as an internal advisor for a workshops series they're creating. I'm excited but can't say yes until I run it back up my leadership chain. Working on a global team means lots of bureaucracy over what is a strategic use of my time. 12:30 p.m. — I am tempted by the pierogis in the office café, but I have my packed salad for lunch. I nurse a second, and then third coffee from the pantry over team meetings and calls for the rest of the day. 6:30 p.m. — A senior manager (and very good friend) from out of town is here on business, so we go out for dinner at a Thai restaurant with a group of colleagues. We share a ton of appetizers, and I pack half of my huge plate of delicious, basil chicken fried rice to-go. A handful of us move on to a nearby bar, where the Hall & Oates song ""I Can't Go For That (No Can Do)"" inspires a fascinating (and NSFW) conversation on personal boundaries. The senior manager picks up both tabs. 1:50 a.m. — Share an Uber home with my colleague, who's crashing on my couch so she doesn't have to trek back to New Jersey. We have a final nightcap and gossip about boys, then fall asleep later than we should. ($11.50 expensed) Daily Total: $0",2,106
"8:15 a.m. — Nudge my colleague awake. We dress speedily, and I wash down milk thistle with lemon water in light of the drinking we did the night before. On the way to the subway, we get lattes and pastries at a hipster café. I suggest we use this commute time for our mentoring check-in, which gives us time to get back later in the day and allows me to expense breakfast. ($12.50 expensed) 2:30 p.m. — It's a full-on day with back-to-back working sessions, planning workshops in Brussels, Zurich, and Montana. I usually travel twice a month to deliver these sessions, so when I'm back in the city like I am now, all of my time is spent planning for the next round. I eat my Thai leftovers for lunch during a conference call. 4:30 p.m. — After some internal debate, I text N. to ask if he's free later that week to hang out. We had a great first date a few weeks ago, then he went on holiday, and we both got wrapped up in respective Thanksgiving plans. We really hit it off, but I don't want to build my hopes up. I definitely have a list of men who've ghosted after, and despite, fantastic first dates. While my New Yorker friends assure me this is common, it's still baffling. You agreed we had a great time! You proactively asked to meet again! And then when faced with the actual planning ... silence. Aziz, write a sequel and break it down for a sister. 7:30 p.m. — Meet my friend for a quick bite at a nearby diner (his office is just a block away) before we head to a concert. Unfortunately, the Christmas tourist crowds have hijacked most restaurants. It takes forever to get a server's attention but the food comes super fast, which makes up for it. We split a burger, have a beer each, and catch up. My fatigue is definitely setting in, but my friend — a master of puns — gets me laughing, and I get a second wind of energy. We usually take turns paying so he picks up this tab, knowing I'll get drinks at the concert. Hop the subway together to Brooklyn. 9:15 p.m. — I get us beers, and we catch part of the opening act (a fantastic Bibi Bourelly) before Jacob Banks gets on stage. It's an intimate but danceable gig, marred only by an annoying couple in front of us that can't decide whether to make out or dance with abandon; either way, they keep blocking our view! Midway through the set, I get us a second round of drinks. $22 11:15 p.m. — Jump in a cab home and crash, forgetting to take off my makeup. $12.50 Daily Total: $34.50",3,106
"8 a.m. — I hit snooze a few times, knowing that I'm working from home today, and my first call isn't until 10 a.m. 9:30 a.m. — A barrage of emails convinces me that I need to get moving. I make a cup of pumpkin spice tea, and eat some chia seed pudding with almond milk and turmeric. Like the lemon water, I've found it helpful to constantly maintain a jar of this in the fridge and top up when it's low. I mentally prepare myself for three hours of conference calls, all of which I'm leading. 1:30 p.m. — Break for a homemade salad of kale, roast chicken strips, almond slices, sliced apples, and roasted sesame dressing. 4 p.m. — Still hungry, so I snack on black sesame ice cream. I'd hoped to go to an afternoon yoga class but my inbox is seething with things that need a response before end of day. This is the primary reason I don't work out enough. 5:30 p.m. — Close my laptop for the day! Take a leisurely stroll to a South African restaurant in the neighborhood near mine, and meet a friend for a quick, pre-theater bite. The menu has lots of interesting dishes I try to work through each time I visit, so we split an appetizer and grab a drink. $23 6:45 p.m. — Brisk walk to the playhouse. My friend stops dead in his tracks and doubles over when I mention that the version of we're watching is four-hours long ... and in Dutch. Turns out, I forgot to mention those key details. This was a birthday gift to him (he prefers experiences to objects), and now I worry it was a bad choice. It turns out to be riveting! Even though there's an intermission to break up the four hours, I get extremely fidgety in the last 20 minutes. 11:30 p.m. — We meet up with other friends who were also at the play and eat a late dinner in the area. We order oysters and cocktails and debrief about the play; none of us can remember the last time we dedicated four consecutive hours to an endeavor, let alone sat still for four hours. Midway through our meal, the cast walks in and we applaud. They still have a few nights to go and must be exhausted. $46.78 1:15 a.m. — After all that sitting down, I decide to walk back home while the others grab cabs. One friend joins me for part of the route, then jumps on a Citi Bike. I love the peacefulness of walking home alone. The air is crisp and many of the brownstones have their Christmas decorations out already. At home, I fall asleep with my makeup on (again) while alternating between doggo memes on Instagram and Tinder swipes. Daily Total: $69.78",4,106
"9:45 a.m. — My alarm goes off, with a reminder that I'm supposed to Skype a friend who just moved back to London from Nepal. I text to ask for an extra hour, and have a small snooze. 11 a.m. — Skype my friend and simultaneously make breakfast: more of that spiced pumpkin tea (it's starting to grow on me) with almond milk, and Greek yogurt layered with granola, almond slices, and blackberries. 3 p.m. — Take an Uber to the office. I usually don't come in on weekends, but my boss is heading to Zurich and needs me to print and prep materials. I have dinner plans in Midtown East anyway so this is basically a free, fast trip into the city. ($18.71 expensed) 3:40 p.m. — Oh my god, I forgot about holiday crowds. Traffic is diverted, some streets are pedestrian only, and I totally underestimated the throngs of tourists clamoring for a glimpse of the tree at Rockefeller Center. Getting to the office is an exercise in patience. 4:45 p.m. — Take the subway then walk to my friend's apartment. She's an aspiring chef who runs monthly supper clubs in her one-bedroom apartment, and tonight is the first time we're co-hosting an informal storytelling supper club. The premise is simple: She cooks; I facilitate; everyone brings their own story, and it's BYOB drinks. I help with food prep and run out to Trader Joe's to get ginger beer for a large pitcher of Moscow Mules. While there, I pick up cannoli, Christmas cookies, chocolate oranges, beet crackers, and sausages for my week ahead. $27.45 7:45 p.m. — Our friends start to arrive and pour themselves drinks; someone even brought all the ingredients to make Negronis! I kick off the night with improv storytelling, share ground rules (basic things like, ""Don't be judgmental.""), and we're off! Over the first course, I share my story; over the courses that follow, I fish names out of a bowl and invite that person to share their story. We're seven people in total and the conversation spans Scientology, travel snafus, Burning Man, moonshine, tipping etiquette, and the Singularity. Everything is themed around ""the first time"" (since this entire night is a pilot), and my friend also cooks dishes she's never made before, including wild venison in lettuce cups, minced buffalo with Szechuan peppers, broiled sea bass, Indian carrot salad, and roast quail. 1:15 a.m. — We finish with cannoli and a bottle of cava, feeling pretty pleased that the storytelling supper club construct worked! We already have ideas brewing for the next one. 1:35 a.m. — I'm ready to call it a night after several consecutive late nights, but one of my friends at dinner convinces me (begs, really) to be his wing woman. He has a crush on a good friend of mine, L., who couldn't make it to dinner but is up for a nightcap. I'm already seeing her for brunch tomorrow, but he's like a brother to me, and the bar is somewhat close to home, so I consider it a favor. We jump in a Lyft Line; he pays. 2 a.m. — We sit at the bar and realize that it's the fourth weekend in a row we've all hung out — mainly because not having to travel for the past five weeks means I've been available to hang out. This kind of uninterrupted stretch only happens twice a year and I have to really push for it. It took weeks of repeatedly voicing my recent work fatigue and ""brownout"" before my boss agreed that I could focus on remote projects for the last month. 3:19 a.m. — Two drinks later, I jump in an Uber home while my friend walks L. home; wink, wink. I ignore a text from a fuck buddy; right now I just need my own bed. $26.79 Daily Total: $54.24",5,106
"11:25 a.m. — Wake from a very blurry dream with Ryan Gosling as my boyfriend to a text from L; she's running late for brunch. I try to go back to the dream but it's not happening. Also belatedly realize I've missed the morning yoga class I'd planned to go to. 12:25 p.m. — Cross the road, literally, to brunch. I order a fried chicken sandwich and coffee, and L. orders mac and cheese and a Bloody Mary and proceeds to spill on the night before. I pass on some of the more intimate details — he's my friend, after all — but hey, at least someone's making progress. N. still hasn't texted me back, and L. agrees that I shouldn't text again, even if the instinct to get passive aggressive is floating right below the surface. We chat about the ex she's meeting with to clear the air, and decide that I'll accompany her to an apartment viewing later. I get half my chicken sandwich to go and a few spoonfuls of her mac and cheese. She pays, and I immediately Venmo her. $30 1:45 p.m. — L.'s ex shows up so I make a graceful exit. I walk to the bank to withdraw cash, and then head to a nail salon, only to end up making an appointment since they're full. On my walk home, I drop into a random boutique and walk out with a Christmas present for my best friend. $25 3:15 p.m. — L. meets me in in front of my building, and we walk a few blocks to the apartment viewing. With the pending L train shutdown, she's exploring other neighborhoods; it would be great to have a girl friend so close. The viewing reminds me that I should definitely be paying less in rent... 3:45 p.m. — I want to hear how the conversation with her ex went, so we get coffee and cake at a charming café we passed on the way to the viewing. We marvel at emotionally mature men, and the ones that get away. $16 4:30 p.m. — Leg it to my mani-pedi appointment, where I switch my phone off and read (the magazine by Away) cover to cover. I bought myself Away luggage for my birthday last month and it was worth every penny. $55 6:30 p.m. — Much needed night in. I water my plants, pack for my work trip to Dallas, and do a round of laundry. I finish off the chicken sandwich for dinner, and add chopped kale to the mac and cheese so I'm not just eating carbs on carbs. Before bed, I faff around reading random articles online and making a new fall-winter playlist. Daily Total: $126",6,106
"8:30 a.m. — Up with, what else, a cup of spiced pumpkin tea. 8:52 a.m. — Order an Uber to the airport (expensed). It's a swift, painless security process today, which isn't usually the case at LaGuardia. Before boarding, I get a coffee and a BLT bagel ($46.57), also expensed. 10:30 a.m. — I really should work on this plane ride, but I just don't feel like it. Decide to unplug with a fluffy chick flick . The video freezes 10 minutes before the ending but I can predict what happens. (Wikipedia later verifies this.) 2:30 p.m. — Land in Dallas where it's 82 degrees! I take the shuttle to my hotel, which is paid for by the company. I'm the only one in the minivan so the driver lets me select the music, and we chat idly about hip-hop. Listening to Miguel; driving past open fields with the sun on my face — if only all trips could start this way. 3 p.m. — After checking into the hotel, I order an Asian chicken salad and coconut water and get to answering emails. ($12 expensed) 4:30 p.m. — Meet a colleague in the hotel lobby so we can take a conference call together. Sitting outside in the sun in early December feels amazing. 6 p.m. — We meet up with the rest of our team for dinner. Tomorrow, we have our biannual strategy offsite; tonight, we have a private room booked with an open bar. I make a plate of avocado mixed green salad, carrot and blue cheese salad, and baked salmon and pumpkin pie from the buffet bar, and wash it down with prosecco. 7 p.m. — The Christmas gag gift exchange commences! I give my ticket to a colleague because I really don't want more stuff at home, and the Pocket Manfriend I'm re-gifting finds a happy home. 9 p.m. — The team heads to another bar. More wine is liberally poured, and we decide to partake in trivia night. We do better than expected but don't win. 11:15 p.m. — We call it a night and head back to the hotel. Before bed, I text-flirt a little with a friend who's sending ambiguous signals, and we confirm plans for the theater when I'm back. Daily Total: $0",7,106
"6:45 a.m. — My best friend is in town visiting me until Sunday! It's a random holiday in France today so I get to spend it with her. I get a quick workout in before she arrives and greet her as her Uber gets to my apartment. We take the metro into Le Marais and get some French bread in her system. We split a cheese and meats plate (yes, we're well aware it's only 10:30 a.m., but it was on the petit dejeuner menu so I don't feel weird ordering it), pain perdu (a.k.a. French toast, which was to die for), a baguette with jam and butter, and I can't not order a cappuccino. I've been in Paris for a month now, and it was the perfect time to get a dose of my closest friend from home. $17.78 12:30 p.m. — After brunch, we walk around Le Marais and head to the Picasso Museum. Luckily for me, I have dual citizenship — American and French — and since I'm still under 26 with an EU passport I get all the perks of the free museums. Unluckily for my friend, she still has to pay. 3 p.m. — My friend was battling a virus the week before. With the jet lag and no sleep on the plane, she's starting to wear down. We stop at a café and order espressos and French onion soup, because of course. Funnily enough, we spot another friend from New York walking by the restaurant who is also visiting this week. We stop and chat. I get to expense this because I get a €150 stipend a week from my job as part of my three-month exchange in Paris. ($16.60 expensed) 4 p.m. — We stop into a boutique that has gently-worn designer clothes for less money. I end up trying on a navy Maje skirt that still has the tag on it and is grossly marked down, despite no one wearing it. I love these stores. I also have a weakness for anything navy. It's cash only and luckily I have the exact amount. My friend contemplates buying a lightly-worn Alexander McQueen sleeveless leather jacket, but I advise her that she could probably find something similar for a lot less elsewhere. She passes, but still thinks about the jacket later. $55 4:30 p.m. — Directly next door is another designer, gently-used store. I know I'm in trouble as soon as I walk in. I've been searching for a shearling coat for years and find one for only €200. My friend deliberates between a cheetah coat, a long, suede, trench-like coat, and an emerald green peacoat. She has an eclectic, but amazing sense of style. I end up finding another coat that is much more practical — a winter puffer by Patagonia. And it's in navy. Although I bought a coat this weekend, I kept the tags on because I wasn't sure of it. In the end, I rationalize that since the shearling and Patagonia coats together are the same price as the one I bought a few days ago, I will return the other one. Score! Two coats for the price of one, and the shearling is very unique. My friend ends up buying the cheetah coat, and naturally I feel less guilty. $408.02 6:30 p.m. — With our wallets in mourning, we opt to do a casual dinner at home tonight. Being in Paris, I have three different cheeses left in my fridge and grapes. We opt to buy a baguette, a dip, prosciutto, and a pastry and almond croissant to split. My friend buys and we head home for the night and make a killer cheese and meat plate, followed by splitting our desserts. Treat yo' self. Daily Total: $480.80",1,107
"6:35 a.m. — Alarm goes off so I head to the gym. I know these next few days with my friends visiting will result in a lot of indulging. I sneak out quietly to avoid waking up my jet-lagged friend who is still sleeping. Post workout, I head home, shower, change and eat petit-suisse yogurt (THE BEST) with strawberry jam and a glass of OJ. I head out for work as my friend gets ready, awaiting our other friend who is arriving soon. 12:30 p.m. — I have a lunch with someone I met this morning by the espresso machine. She seems nice and is here for an internship. My friend from work comes along with us. I buy a lentil salad and yogurt for dessert, resisting any of the other tempting delicious desserts. It seems like Paris' biggest meal is always lunch. People typically have a soup, sandwich, and dessert — very different from my Chopt/Sweetgreen salad life back in NYC. I fully embrace it, except for today since I'm anticipating the big dinner I'll have later with my friends. ($12.27 expensed) 6:45 p.m. — Finally get out of work to meet my friends. I hop on the metro to meet them at the restaurant. $1.80 7:15 p.m. — YES! We got a table. I've been wanting to try this place, as it was on many of my friends' lists, but it's walk-in only. As I arrive, my friends are bickering about how they have different tastes on the wine. They rely on me to pick a bottle. We end up with something we all like. Phew. We're big splitters, so we split the burrata with caraway seeds, foie gras, pappardelle with lamb, and a cheese plate. Everything is divine. We split another bottle of wine between the two of us; it's Thursday after all and I feel like celebrating that they're here. We end up debating about whether to get just one or two desserts, but I force them to get two: a pear ice cream crumble (the waitress said was her favorite) and a decadent chocolate cake. YUM. Probably didn't need the secnd bottle of wine, or the second dessert for that matter, but c'est la vie? $73.63 11:15 p.m. — We head home on the metro and get ready for bed. Unfortunately, I have to work tomorrow while they get to play around Paris. $1.80 Daily Total: $77.23",2,107
"8:25 a.m. — I wake up a bit later than normal, but still manage to eat my usual yogurt and strawberry jam and get ready fast enough to arrive to work on time. Luckily, my apartment is only a 10-minute walk from the office. Even though it's Friday, I still like to get to work on time since I'm only here for a few months to ensure I make a good impression. 12:30 p.m. — Go to a creperie for lunch with the daughter of a woman I worked with in the U.S. We end up getting seated downstairs in the restaurant, and the only other two people seated down there are coworkers who we are friendly with, so we end up combining tables. It's nice to hang out with them and we discuss office gossip and our plans are for the weekend. I get to expense it as part of my weekly stipend while working here. ($16.37 expensed) 5:15 p.m. — I checked out some new online shopping websites. I found an awesome pair of sneakers for $55, and an oversized denim jacket I've been eager to lock down for only $30. Definitely don't need either, but they're a good deal so I decide to go for it anyways. During checkout I realize it only ships to the U.S. I think of them as a welcome-back gift to myself for when I return to New York after my exchange. I tend to rationalize purchases like these in this manner. At least I'm not paying rent for these three months. $85.80 6:15 p.m. — Meet my friends back at my apartment and we decide to chill for a bit before our dinner reservation instead of hitting up a happy hour. After getting ready, we take the metro around 8:45 p.m. and stop at a cool speakeasy-type of cocktail bar across the street from the restaurant. Each drink is crafty, and costs €16 each. My friend pays as a treat. They taste like spa water in the best way possible. We chat for a bit and then head across the street for our reservation. $1.80 10:30 p.m. — This is going to be more of our ""bourgie"" dinner. This spot is supposed to be quite chic and the upstairs turns into a club. We split the burrata (no other appetizer catches our eye), the steak frites for two, and the mushroom truffle ravioli along with one bottle of wine this time. The food wasn't great and the ambiance actually reminded me a lot of a place in NYC, but we still have a great time. Our waiter is a hilarious man who makes our experience extra lovely. We check out the upstairs after din, but decide to ditch for a more local spot as it's not as ""lit"" as we were expecting. $59.69 12:30 a.m. — We get to one of my favorite spots from studying abroad in Paris that hasn't changed for decades. It's a restaurant upstairs and an old wine cave downstairs with great music. It tends to get a bit hot down there without any air circulation, but never disappoints. I order us each a drink and my friends both Venmo me back. Unfortunately, it's closing at 2 a.m., so we don't have much time to people-watch and dance. We have a big day ahead of us tomorrow and decide to call it quits when it closes. I order us an Uber and my friends Venmo me for their portion. $16 Daily Total: $163.29",3,107
"11 a.m. — Alarm goes off to our dismay. The block-out shades in France are crazy good; too good. We slowly get moving and have decided we will Uber to the Chateau de Versailles to save time. Before ordering the Uber, we stop at a boulangerie across the street and get treats — pain d'amandes au chocolat for me. My friend pays since she's trying to get rid of her cash. I order the Uber and my friends Venmo me for their share. $11.50 1 p.m. — Museum entrance is free for me; love these under-26 passport perks! We decide to start with the gardens and then the chateau since the weather doesn't look too promising. My friend and I stop and take a picture with each statue, and pose just like it. We think we're funny. People are staring, but I think they think we're funny, too. The gardens are absolutely beautiful with the season's colors starting to change. We continue towards the domain of Marie Antoinette; this place is HUGE. 3 p.m. — We stop at Angelina's inside the Chateau grounds because I refuse to have my friends leave Paris without having one of Angelina's famous hot chocolates. Seriously, if you come to Paris and you don't get this hot chocolate, shame on you. It's literally chocolate bars melted. Insane. We each get a hot chocolate and a sandwich, and I split a dessert with my friend because I have zero willpower and pretend that everything in Europe is made with better quality ingredients and therefore is good for me. I still kinda believe this is true. $15.32 4:30 p.m. — Halfway through the tour of the castle, we stop at Ladurée and get macarons. My friend is enamored by them and he says it's his treat, so I can't resist despite still being full from the hot chocolate earlier. We each take a bite of each one and end up scarfing down the whole box in probably two minutes or less. The cashier looks at us half laughing, half filled with scorn, and probably screaming, , in her head as she watches. Oh well. 6 p.m. — We are literally closing down Versailles. No, seriously: Security guards are yelling at us to leave as we take pictures we post on our Instagrams later. We get the shots and finally get going. We choose to train/subway back to Paris for our dinner reservation. We each buy our respective train tickets and are exhausted. We reviewing the photos we took, trying to cackle silently as to not disturb any Parisians on the train and be rude. $4.27 7 p.m. — I had made us a different dinner reservation, but my friend hasn't had his dose of French onion soup yet, and I'm scared the bourgie restaurant won't have it, despite having a cool view of the Eiffel Tower. We opt to go to the Montmartre area, which is very cultural and filled with local artists, to get a more classic French meal. We each order the appetizer, entree, and dessert prix fixe, plus a bottle of white wine the waitress recommends and cheese fondue as our entrees. DIVINE. We each test our respective appetizers: escargot, a salad with jambon, and of course, the French onion soup. We also taste each others' desserts: crepe a nutella, creme brulee, and a tarte tatin. All amazing. After dinner, we stop by the Sacre Coeur and peep inside the beautiful old church. We head home on the subway since my friends leave early tomorrow morning. $39 Daily Total: $70.09",4,107
"6 a.m. — My friends leave and I roll around in bed as I hear them get ready to call the Uber. I say goodbye half-asleep and get back into bed and set an alarm for 11 a.m. I'm meeting old family friends in the outskirts of Paris at 1 p.m. for lunch. 11 a.m. — Alarm goes off. I swear I could've slept for five more hours. Entertaining your friends nonstop is tiring, but worth it! I get ready and take the bus/RER out to St. Geramin-en-Laye where I apparently I used to hang out a lot at as a two year old, but it doesn't spark my memory much. I have to buy more Metro/bus tickets along with the RER pass, and I opt for the 10-metro ticket deal, which gives you a free ticket. $23.38 12:40 p.m. — I arrive in St. Germain-en-Laye, see a Starbucks and am dying for a coffee. I already feel guilty going into a Starbucks knowing how much I'm about to spend on a cappuccino, but they have soy milk and I don't want to be tired and rude at the lunch, so I splurge. I can't believe it's nearly $7 (with the conversion rate) for a TALL cappuccino. I declare this robbery and vow to never go to another Starbucks in Europe again. I arrive a bit early for lunch, so I walk around the old castle grounds before heading to the restaurant. I love how Europe just has casual castles standing around. $6.61 1 p.m. — I was a bit nervous I wouldn't be able to recognize my family friends as I haven't seen them in a solid 10 years, but they are luckily entering as soon as I do, and I semi-recognize one of them. Not as awkward as I expected! We talk in French the whole time, as I prefer to do this whenever I have a choice, even if they do speak English. I'm practically fluent, thanks to my French mom, but I still want to perfect it whenever I can. We have plenty to catch up on and they both work in my industry so it's nice to hear their points of view. They end up treating me to lunch, which is nice for my wallet after the past few days. I head back to Paris around 3:30 p.m. taking the RER/bus again. 4 p.m. — Once I get off the bus, I stop at a Monoprix to pick up laundry detergent and a few things to eat for the week. I plan to expense it since I have my weekly stipend. I get laundry detergent, softener, ham, authentic Italian-looking pasta (instead of the typical packaged stuff), and gruyere. ($28.20 expensed) 4:35 p.m. — I get home, throw a load of laundry in filled with all the towels we used the past few days, and listen to the episode of Jennifer Lawrence interviewing Kim Kardashian. It's hilarious! I promised myself earlier I'd go out for a bike ride after everything I indulged in with my friends visiting. I realize I only have an hour until sundown. I throw my gym clothes on and hop on a Velib, the Paris bike rental program, and head towards the park. It's not SoulCycle class, but I got a membership for only €30 for the entire year before I arrived (it was the reduced price because I'm under 26). It's crazy how much cheaper things are in Europe, especially for those under 26. I thought CitiBike's for $163/year was a good deal in New York! 5:40 p.m. — The bike ride was lovely and energized me. I love this time alone, while still getting to enjoy the outdoors. I get home right as it's getting dark, shower, and cook up the pasta with the ingredients I bought earlier, adding in pesto from my fridge for added flavor. I'm exhausted and get to sleep by 10 p.m. after watching and These shows are my guilty pleasure to the max! Daily Total: $29.99",5,107
"8:15 a.m. — Alarm goes off. Ugh, Monday. I'm still tired from the past few days of nonstop plans. I get ready for work, eat my usual yogurt with strawberry jam, and head out. I stop and chat with my super for a bit, who compliments me on my shearling coat. At least someone's noticing my new purchases! 12:15 p.m. — Since I live so close to the office, I like to have one day where I head home and eat in the comfort of my own home. I contemplate eating my leftover pasta for lunch, but am craving a soup so I stop off at the grab-and-go spot next door. I get a potato and leek soup, a small side salad with mini-shrimp and avocado, and of course, a piece of baguette as is tradition in France. You simply cannot eat a meal without bread! It comes out to $9 and change, but I will expense it with my stipend later. I eat the soup and in the end, also eat the leftover pasta. I save the side salad for tonight's dinner, as I'll get home late after ballet. I finish up the last 20 minutes of the documentary I was watching the other day and head back to work. ($9.24 expensed) 6:40 p.m. — I leave work and head home. I've been craving a dance class, as I used to do ballet for the majority of my life. I researched a place where classes are only €15 and it looks pretty decent. I stop and talk to my super again, and he says he has a present for me. He's cute and young and I haven't been able to tell if we are flirting with each other until this moment; he gives me a gift of a pink ribbon. I have no idea what this means, but am curious and thank him. I munch on eggplant dip I have so I'm not starving by the time I get back from dance. I get ready and hop on a Velib to cut down on walking time to the studio. 7:30 p.m. — Shoot! I get to the Velib station near the studio and there are no spots left to drop my bike off. Panicked I'll be late for ballet class, I try to search for another Velib spot nearby on Google. Luckily, someone comes by two minutes later and takes a bike out so I'm not late for class. I get into the dance studio and the teacher is super nice; we emailed before so she remembered me and I pay for the class. I was worried I was a bit out of shape for the advanced class, but to my surprise I still got it! The teacher was fantastic. I'll definitely be coming back. $17 9:30 p.m. — I choose to walk home this time, about a 20-minute walk so that I don't have to deal with not having any open spots to park the Velib. I stop into a store to grab water as I'm dying of thirst after the ballet class. Each stride I take makes me note how sore I will be tomorrow. When I get home, I eat the side salad and have a spoonful of Nutella so I can't complain about being hungry if I wake up in the middle of the night. I watch some Netflix and swipe on Bumble and Happn. I've gotta say, the dating scene and these apps are much more successful for me in New York. It's probably the culture difference, but every time someone messages me some weird slang I don't understand, I deem them as being creepy and never respond. I end up passing out around 11:30 p.m. without much hope for finding a French lover during my short time here. $1 Daily Total: $18",6,107
"8:15 a.m. — Alarm goes off and I'm feeling very drowsy. I attribute this to leaving my heat on high all night and drying me out. I better not get sick again. I was sick two weeks ago! I eat my typical yogurt and strawberry jam with a glass of OJ. I never get sick of yogurt that tastes this good. 11:45 a.m. — At lunchtime, I have two back-to-back calls for the global millennial core group I'm a member of at my company, so I decide to run out and get something to eat at my desk during the calls. I can expense this with my stipend. I get the special of the day, which is salmon and mashed potatoes with some sort of green sauce I can't figure out. Because it's a French lunch, the offer also comes with a small carrot-apple fresh-pressed juice and an apple crumble dessert. Nom. ($14 expensed) 4 p.m. — I'm WhatsApping with my mom and semi-harassing her to give me a definite date she wants to leave to see my grandmother for Christmas, before prices get outrageous. She'll be coming to Paris before and then we will take the train to my grandma's together. I finally get her to choose and she says if I get the train tickets for the both of us online, she will reimburse me as a Christmas gift. I was expecting to have to pay for my ticket myself which would have been about $85 for my part, so I'm a bit relieved, especially after the shopping splurges last week and my friends being in town. ($205 expensed) 6:15 p.m. — I stop by Monoprix and pick up a few things I need: two hand creams (one for my purse, one for my apartment), body wash, and hair ties. I will use my stipend money and expense this later. I head home and despite still feeling drowsy and sore AF from ballet last night, I force myself to hit the gym. I try out a Kayla workout after a 15-minute cardio warm-up. Damn that was hard! Her Bikini Body Guide is no joke and makes me reminisce on how dependent I am on Equinox classes to force me to work hard, and how much I miss their classes. ($16 expensed) 8:30 p.m. — I get home, shower, and make dinner: chicken and green beans. Back to being healthy and on a budget. Le sigh. My body and wallet desperately need this, I remind myself. I crawl into bed and watch Bravo before calling it bedtime around 11 p.m. I'm a huge sleeper and this past week has taken its toll on me. No wonder I felt a bit sick this morning. If I don't get an average of eight hours minimum a night at least four times a week, I really feel it. Daily Total: $0",7,107
"6:30 a.m. — Wake up at 6:30, which is annoying for a Sunday. Read the newspaper online and do some online Christmas present browsing while my husband sleeps. At 7:30, I eat porridge with grated carrot and banana for breakfast, log on, and do a few hours of work. Our lawyers have asked that my team complete a review of a legal document before 10 a.m., having only provided it at 5 p.m. on Saturday night. I do this and a few other things. I'm in the middle of a deal, and it will make my life for the coming week so much easier if I just do it now. I drink three espressos, three glasses of water and a vitamin D tablet (which I do every morning as per NHS guidelines!). 10 a.m. — I catch the bus into the city to meet my friend for brunch at Soho House. On the way, I see a large suitcase completely alone on the side of the street, just near Oxford Circus. This has genuinely never happened to me before, having lived in London for six years, but I follow the protocol and ring the anti-terrorism hotline to report it, all the while feeling silly but knowing it's the right thing to do. The police arrive in a very impressive three minutes, sirens blaring. They don't tell me what happened, but it appears that a tourist left their suitcase on the street. On the way to brunch, I get papped by a street photographer for looking ""cool,"" which has genuinely never happened to me either. I laugh, knowing that this will make me sound like someone I completely am not (i.e. cool). Brunch is lovely: turmeric eggs with turkey bacon and two cups of Earl Grey. $22 1 p.m. — I hit the shops and buy new perfume (£48) and a thick knit from COS (£69). I catch the bus home, chat to a friend on the phone, and get an email telling me that a silver photo frame that has been out of stock is back in stock. I buy it as a replacement for my niece, who cried when she broke the one I when I gave her as a thank-you present for being my flower girl a year ago (£20). $183 3 p.m. — I get home, do three hours of work, and my husband makes dinner: pork with chili and lemongrass, and a red cabbage, coriander, and lime salad. (The ingredients are from a grocery trip the day before.) I read in bed, drink two cups of licorice tea, and fall asleep at 10. Daily Total: $205",1,108
"6 a.m. — Alarm goes off at 6, and I make porridge again with carrot, banana, and cinnamon, and have two espressos. I am out the door by 6:30 and off to the gym, where I do 20 minutes of HIIT sprints, and then arms for 40 minutes. My gym is my happy place. It is one of those lovely gyms with fluffy towels, GHD hair straighteners, and white robes. They iron your shirts for free, always an added incentive to go. I drink one and a half liters of water by the time I have left the gym. 8:50 a.m. — Get to work, drink have an espresso, and start my day. (Work coffee is awesome: An iPad takes my order and the machine automatically grinds the beans and makes it fresh.) At 11:30, I eat canned tuna I brought from home and a peppermint tea (also provided by work). At 12:30 I eat the veggie and chicken salad I brought from home; it has chicken breast, roasted broccoli and peppers, peas, tomatoes, and avocado. (My husband and I spend about $500 per month on groceries for the two of us. We mostly eat at home and I bring a homemade lunch to work most days.) I'm stuffed and read the newspaper while eating at my desk. 8 p.m. — Catch the tube home. Husband has cooked an organic turkey mince with courgettes and chili, and a side of red cabbage and coriander. I pack for my upcoming work trip and then lie in bed, finishing my book for 30 minutes before falling asleep at 10.30. Daily Total: $0",2,108
"4:15 a.m. — Wide awake, but I secretly love it when this happens. I get so much more time to potter in the mornings. I get up at 5 a.m., having played on Instagram and read the newspaper online, and make myself porridge and a pot of coffee. I finish packing my carry-on and catch an Uber to work ($20 expensed, due to my work trip) and am at my desk at 7. I drink a half-liter of water and a cup of peppermint tea. 8:30 a.m. — I have an external meeting at 9 a.m. and head over with the rest of the deal team at 8:30. It's an all-parties M&A meeting, so there are about 30 people in the room. I ask several questions of the other side and get slightly condescending responses, putting me in a foul mood. I avoid the breakfast food they put out (all pastries) and drink an espresso and a glass of water. I am back at my desk by noon, take a couple of calls, brief my team, and eat lunch reading the paper online at 1 p.m. It's organic chicken, broccoli, grated carrot, avocado and pumpkin seeds, for lunch, which I made this morning. Feeling really dehydrated so I drink a half-bottle of water and a cup of peppermint tea. 5 p.m. — I head to the airport on the tube and fly to Zurich (cost covered by work) at 6:30, arriving into Zurich at 9 p.m. local time. I read work materials on the flight; I am that person. My flight is a small aircraft, almost entirely filled with male commuters making the same trip as me. I reflect on the fact that I can go an entire week without talking to a woman in a professional context; fortunately, this has not been one of those weeks. I don't buy anything at the airport (it's a commuter airport) and I don't eat airplane food, so when I get to my hotel, I am starving. My hotel is just lovely: It has fancy designs, a bike hanging from the ceiling, and a walk-in shower roughly the size of my bathroom in London. I eat dinner at the hotel — lamb with vegetables (40 CHF expensed) — and get to sleep at midnight. Daily Total: $0",3,108
"6 a.m. — I get up, drink an espresso, and go for a run. I love doing this on work trips as it is such a great way to a see a city that you otherwise wouldn't have time to. Zurich is immaculate and I'm obsessed with the cute Swiss buildings. There are no other runners around however, making me think there is a great running track somewhere else that I am missing; it's completely freezing as well. I get back to my hotel at 7 a.m. and am out the door by 7:30. 9 a.m. — Getting ready quickly is my secret superpower. I have meetings until noon, so I eat a turmeric yogurt with nuts and dates around (CHF 10, expensed) and have another espresso during my meeting. At noon, I leave the office to commute to the other office, about 30 minutes away. I get lost on the way as I decide to catch the tram (taxis are ludicrously expensive and slower than the excellent public transport), and arrive at the office at 1 p.m., thereby missing the official Swiss lunch hour, meaning there is genuinely no food whatsoever. One of the PAs takes pity on me and repeatedly tells me she can ""go find bread."" I decline and eat a soggy apple. 5 p.m. — I finish up and decide to head back to my hotel on the tram (4 CHF, expensed), since there is a proper restaurant there that serves food all day. By the time I get to the hotel, I am on verge of hungry tears, particularly when they tell me they don't serve food until 6. I check my emails, am seated promptly at 6, and have a delicious meal of cauliflower, roasted chicken, and hummus with minced beef (50 CHF, expensed). I now feel full and a little sick as I wolfed it down too fast. The people next to me are discussing cryptocurrencies and the risk of online hacking, making me want to join their conversation; I don't because Swiss people are notoriously private. 7 p.m. — At my hotel desk after having had a nice long hot shower and put on a face mask. I drink two liters of water and have two cups of green tea. I have work calls at 8.30 on a new deal – I have never had so many deals on the go at one time and I start to panic about all the balls in the air. I send my boss an email, quickly chat with my husband (one of my best friends had a baby today, and another friend's mum had a big operation) and hit the sack at midnight. Daily Total: $0",4,108
"4:15 a.m. — Wake up; my husband (who also works in finance) is online, so I call him and we have a quick chat. He sounds tired and we both cannot wait for the weekend. (That's a bit of a fools' promise, as we both have to work but are pretending we won't have to.) We put a lot of faith in the restorative capabilities of weekends. I log onto my computer, do a little work and then shower and get suited, and go down to the hotel's café for breakfast. It is pitch black and I am the only one there. I have three eggs and an espresso, and catch an Uber to the office (45 CHR, expensed) for an 8 a.m. breakfast meeting. On the way, I buy a COS work dress online (£55) as I am rapidly running out of work clothes. (Read: I have a shopping addiction.) $70 8:30 a.m. — I have back-to-back meetings all day with senior people, and I am told it is not acceptable to check my emails on my phone. At 1, I have a working lunch which involves me working and not eating. I manage to stuff in some carrots and aubergine which are delicious (free), and I have three espressos (free). At 6, I have a compulsory networking session and as I have been in meetings all day I am terrified at the thought of my inbox. I have nine missed calls from my deal team who knew I was unavailable except in urgent circumstances. I start to panic and try calmly to keep it together. I catch the train back to my hotel (5 CHF, expensed), all the while trying to understand what the email chains are telling me; there are just too many to sort through. I get to my hotel at 8, and then start to work. Things aren't as bad as I thought; it's the anticipation of something going wrong that is one of the hardest part of this job — the hardest being when you make a mistake. 9 p.m. — I order room service for dinner, a small side of chicken and small side of aubergine, (50 CHF, expensed), but I can barely taste it as I am so stressed. I have a call with my boss for 20 minutes then work until 10. I have a long shower, wash my hair as am doing a very big presentation tomorrow, drink one and half liters of water, and pack my bag. I get into bed at 11, and send a message to my husband who is at football with friends and having a great time. Daily Total: $70",5,108
"4:47 a.m. — Awake, but exhausted. I get up at 5 a.m. and start to prep for a big presentation I have today. I am typically either good at public speaking or atrocious, depending on the day and how caffeinated I am. I have an espresso, dress, and am out the door at 6:45. I manage to locate some porridge and am delighted. The Swiss seem to eat only croissants for breakfast, yet are somehow all very lean. (Expensed) 8 a.m. — I catch an Uber to the office (37 CHF, expensed) and am the first to arrive. Typical, as am usually incapable of being late. I have a double espresso and read through my presentation. By the time my turn arrives, I am sweating and my heart is pounding. I remind myself repeatedly that this is an excellent opportunity to impress, and the thumping in my heart is simply a matter of being outside of my comfort zone. I present and it goes fine. I am not the worst by far, but not the best. Various senior people approach me afterwards and I am pleased that this has opened the door for various conversations with senior stakeholders. 1 p.m. — The meetings are finished, and I am out the door with my carry-on. I catch an Uber to the airport (40 CHF) and have a late lunch at a delightful café that has a vegetarian buffet of fried aubergines, the freshest yellow carrots I have ever seen, and artichoke (25 CHF, expensed). I go to Läderach, the most delicious chocolate shop in the entire world and buy a box of my favorite chocolates as a birthday present to myself for next week. They cost CHF 30! For 12! There is also a Swiss Army Knife shop, and I buy a pocket knife for my father in law for Christmas (CHF 33) and am delighted. I love incidental shopping. I do a quick call with my husband and jump on the plane. I work on the flight back to London and try to stay awake. The plane leaves promptly on time, reminding me that I love the Swiss for their timekeeping vigilance. $66 6:30 p.m. — I arrive home via Heathrow (expensed) and we have visitors staying: Aussie friends who have been honeymooning in Europe and are on their way back to Australia. They are staying at our place for just one night before an early flight the next day. We take them to a beautiful local pub for a low-key dinner and Uber there; I pay. My eyes are watering and I'm so tired I can barely see. I have steak and a glass of white wine. My husband pays for us all (£110) and we catch an Uber home; I pay. I am in bed by 11. $175.63 Daily Total: $241.63",6,108
"6 a.m. — Awake at 6 on a Saturday (of course), but at least I am feeling far, far better. I have three espressos and read the newspaper in bed. The Aussies leave for the airport (my husband orders them an Uber (£9 to the train station), and I hit the gym. Today is leg day and surprisingly I feel quite good and energetic. $12 11 a.m. — I come home from the gym and work until 5. I also book a work trip to Birmingham (expensed) and order a designer dress on sale for my Christmas party (£100). I try to nap for an hour and fail, then I get ready to go to a friend's house for Guy Fawkes fireworks night at 6. Because everyone else is doing the same, an Uber that should cost £6 costs £30, so I walk 45 minutes. I'm at risk of missing the fireworks, but I quickly buy a bottle of wine and marshmallows on the way. $158.07 8 p.m. — Our friends have the most incredible roof terrace overlooking all of London, and they make us chili and gluten-free cornbread. I have a glass of wine and am broken by 10:30. We catch an Uber home (£6, I pay) and I am asleep by 11:30. $9 Daily Total: $179.07",7,108
"8:45 a.m. — Woke up on vacation and read some more of my book, . I'm ready for this book to be over, but I'm too far in to quit. My boyfriend comes in the room and tells me he's heading to the hotel gym. I begrudgingly change and agree to go as well. We've had a few too many Thanksgiving meals on this trip so far. First with my family and then with his — and leftovers for days. My family lives in Florida, his in Ohio, and we live in California. We were fortunate to be able to plan a trip to see everyone! 3:15 p.m. — Come back from the gym to hear his uncle has ordered pizza and wings. Yum. Head to the hotel pool/bar/game area with my boyfriend and his parents to watch the Ohio State vs. Michigan football game. Throughout the third and fourth quarters, I nervously drink two Miller Lites and my BF drinks a rum and coke. Sweet victory for the Buckeyes. $18 4 p.m. — We're leaving Florida tomorrow to head back to L.A. My boyfriend gets a little anxious when we get back late on Sundays before work, and he really wants to change our flight. We decide to book a 7 a.m. rather than our original 7 p.m. We use points for half (19,000) and I pay for the rest ($156). We like to use my credit card for travel because of the rewards. Everything generally evens out. $156 9:30 p.m. — Later this evening, we have a large family dinner. After, the younger cousins want to go go-karting. I offer to go and play arcade games with them in between their races. They're so cute and fun! Ah, to be a kid again. Daily Total: $174",1,109
"4:45 a.m. — Up early to get to the airport. I call an Uber. $33.64 6:30 a.m. — Soon, we're at the gate and I spend my time scrolling through Twitter and finishing on Netflix. My boyfriend says I've become more gossipy since binge-watching this show and I'm not very sad that it's over. On the flight, I sleep head down on the tray with my hood up for all but 30 minutes of the five-hour flight. 10:30 a.m. — Once at LAX, we see that an Uber to get home would cost $99; it usually costs around $30. Looks like we're waiting for the bus! After 40 minutes, we're on our way to Hollywood. My boyfriend pays $8 each for the bus ride. I'm very thankful for this cheap transportation option. 5:25 p.m. — Later in the day, after lounging, we decide to head to the grocery store. We take a quick stroll around Trader Joe's for items for the week: baby spinach, sweet potatoes, zucchini, chips, salsa, mini-peppermint ice cream treats, meatless sausage patties, pasta sauce, and parmesan. My boyfriend pays ($70) since I bought the flights. 9:15 p.m. — I lay in bed and finish my book before falling asleep. Daily Total: $33.64",2,109
"6:45 a.m. — Wake up around 6:45 to shower, pack my lunch, do my hair, and put minimal makeup on for the workday: mascara, eyebrow pencil, under eye concealer. Since I got an IUD and stopped taking the BC pill, my face has had some rough breakouts. I also have a horrible skin-picking problem that I'm trying to overcome. I try to not wear makeup to work so that I can wear my prescribed acne medication. I microwave and eat two meatless sausage patties for breakfast; they're actually very tasty! I head to the metro station across the street and take the short ride — just 15 minutes to work. (#Blessed) 8:40 a.m. — I really enjoy my work and I'm happy to be back at the office and see colleagues. It's a busy day getting back into the swing of things. I've been training someone new at work, which has been an interesting learning experience for me. I really want to be in management someday, but I am seeing some of my weaknesses come out. I need to be more willing to delegate and be patient with the process. 10:10 a.m. — I've really missed playing sports since post-grad. A few weeks ago, I searched for a women's lacrosse team in L.A. and found one that's pretty active. They have a tournament coming up in February and I've decided to join them. I Venmo my playing costs to reserve my spot. $80 11:50 a.m. — A friend and I eat our lunch together every day. I love L.A. because even in November we can sit outside! I eat my lunch of a 99-cent tuna packet, peanut butter and jelly, and strawberries. After eating, I walk to the library across the street from my office. I drop off two books, one I read and one I did not. I stroll through the ""popular"" section and pick up two books I've heard great things about. 2:15 p.m. — I eye a few Cyber Monday deals throughout the day and place an order for my sister's Christmas gift, Victoria's Secret workout leggings. I ship it right to her apartment in Columbus so she can get them sooner; she's the best. $71.54 2:20 p.m. — Given my skin problems, I want to add an exfoliator to my beauty regime. After thorough research (I am a junkie for reviews), I order bareMinerals Mix. Exfoliate. Smooth cleanser. bareMinerals is having a 25% off sale and free shipping. Not bad! $17.21 5:55 p.m. — After getting off the subway I get a text from my BF to grab butter. I stop at CVS — is $4.99 a normal cost for butter? I get home and change right into workout clothes. If I let myself sit on the couch, I'll be stuck there until 10 p.m. I call my best friend from home and we catch up on each others' lives for 30 minutes; it warms my heart. Head down to the gym and walk on an incline while starting a new book from the library, . $4.99 9:20 p.m. — Not too hungry after the gym, I eat applesauce with cinnamon and paint my nails. My nails have been a money compromise for me. I love mani-pedis but I couldn't accept the cost. I have been using Sally Hansen Miracle Gel and I love it! (P.S.: Walgreens has sales on the polish every few weeks.) I text my boyfriend's mom and give her ideas for Christmas gifts he wants; she gets a great deal on a new yoga mat and shirt. Daily Total: $173.74",3,109
"7 a.m. — Wake up and do my morning routine. My boyfriend makes his own cold brew at home which is awesome, super strong, and saves a lot of money. I make a glass and add water and creamer to de-concentrate it a little. Once I get to work, I eat a banana, have a few meetings, and work on deliverables due this afternoon. 11:45 a.m. — Eat a quick lunch outside; it's pretty hot today. I eat leftovers of what my BF made for dinner last night: risotto, mushrooms, and zucchini. I'm so happy he cooks because I used to eat way too much takeout before we lived together. 1:20 p.m. — After lunch, my friend and I take a short walk to Starbucks for a caffeine fix. Grande iced coffee with almond milk and peppermint syrup. Warning! It tastes like toothpaste when it's cold! like a hot peppermint mocha! I still drink it anyway. $2.95 3:15 p.m. — My mom recently mentioned I need to start paying my phone bill, and I totally agree. I set up recurring payments to her out of my bank account. $52 5:10 p.m. — When we moved, I got rid of all my lacrosse gear. Since I'll be playing again soon, I need a stick and goggles. I take a look at eBay and order a used stick ($22 + $12.99 shipping) and used goggles ($14.99). Used sticks are better anyways because they're broken in. I'm SO excited to play soon! $49.98 5:35 p.m. — After work, I walk to Target and pick up a few necessities for BF and myself. Trash bags, deodorant for us both, CeraVe face wash, coffee creamer, and a plain t-shirt. $55.65 7 p.m. — I want to get my parents an Echo Dot for Christmas but I share a Prime account with my mom. I log onto my boyfriend's account to buy it so she can't see. It's on sale, and I will get 3% cash back thanks to eBates! $32.98 7:30 p.m. — My boyfriend is cooking sweet potato fries, and I make salad with spinach, corn, and cheese. Eat, read , and bed! Daily Total: $193.56",4,109
"6 a.m. — Wake up at 6. Take a small sliver of pre-workout, and do a leg workout in the gym. 7:50 a.m. — Get ready and head to work. I eat a banana and drink cold brew from home while on the subway. 9:45 a.m. — It's a slow day at work. I don't have meetings until 1, but I work on a few odds and ends. I'm planning a crucial conversation with my boss: I want more responsibilities and to be more involved with our business partners. I really hope I can grab time with him this week. 11:30 a.m. — I remember my grandma mentioning that she wanted a new robe. Since I don't know exactly what she likes, I order four from Macy's via eBates (6% cash back) so she can take her pick. I feel like it will be hilarious opening four different robes on Christmas morning. $150.22 12 p.m. — Same lunch as yesterday! Finish the workday with three meetings, and take the metro home. 6:15 p.m. — I'm growing a pretty large pile of clothes I no longer wear, so I've been trying hard to stay away from fast fashion. I downloaded the Poshmark app this morning, and I take photos of the clothes that I want to sell. Fingers crossed I can get rid of some of this. BF makes pasta with artichoke and spicy Alfredo sauce for dinner. I catch up on before bed. Daily Total: $150.22",5,109
"6:15 a.m. — Wake up and do a quick arms and shoulders work out at the apartment gym. I'm grumpy this morning and make an iced coffee to jumpstart my mood. At least it's already Thursday. I eat peanut butter toast with honey and head to work. I know it will be a fairly busy day since it's the end of the month. 1:10 p.m. — Today is so meh. My period is absolutely coming soon. For lunch, I eat leftover pasta and watermelon from the cafeteria. Post lunch, I read a few Money Diaries. I notice I'm antsy and have bitten my cuticle to a point of pain. I decide to make a deal with myself that I can't buy any new makeup (I asked my mom for an Ulta gift card for Christmas) until I make positive progress on this issue; help wanted! 2:45 p.m. — My work friend and I decided to take a break and walk to a bakery for a pick-me-up. She picks out a few different pieces of bread and I get something called Chocolate-Cookie-Bread. It's obviously delicious. $1.90 5:45 p.m. — On my way home from work, I finally hit purchase on items in my Amazon cart: a phone case with a ring holder and a facial hair remover. Sometimes I let items sit in the cart to ensure that I really want/need them. Once home, I do the dishes and begin watching on Netflix. I haven't laughed this hard at a show in a long time. 10/10. $21.79 7:35 — I take a bath while listening to Beyoncé and Ed Sheeran's new song on repeat, scrub the tub clean, and shower. That was strangely therapeutic. Head to bed shortly after reading . Daily Total: $23.69",6,109
"7:55 a.m. — I wake up after snoozing my alarm for almost an hour (?!) and get ready for work. I make a PB & J for lunch and take a tuna packet. I notice the cold brew is gone, so I head to Dunkin' Donuts before the train for an almond milk latte with ~pumpkin swirl~. Listen to the podcast on the commute. $2.88 12:15 p.m. — At lunch, I walk around downtown listening to the same podcast. I've already eaten my sandwich at my desk. I begin thinking about what BF and I should do tonight and start searching comedy shows near us. I suggest an improv show at UCB and buy tickets before they sell out. ($12 each with $1.50 fee) $27 5:45 p.m. — Instead of going out to dinner, I stop at Trader Joe's for cheese and crackers, which I've oddly been craving. I also pick up a bottle of pinot grigio to pregame the comedy show. $14.59 10 p.m. — After the comedy show, we head to a few bars within walking distance of our apartment. My boyfriend and I rotate on who picks up the tab on the vodka waters and Budweisers. Goodnight had by all. $21.87 Daily Total: $66.34",7,109
"12 p.m. — My boyfriend and I wake up after sleeping in; he's visiting me this weekend from school. He's a fifth-year senior (I'm jealous) and lives about three hours away. I usually visit him, but this weekend we're going to watch the Ravens play in Baltimore. We finally get up and head out to breakfast before we drive up. I get breakfast tacos, he gets an omelet, and we both get iced coffees. The bill is about $30; he picks it up. 3 p.m. — My boyfriend and I check into the hotel we're staying at tonight before the football game tomorrow. I work for a hotel company and get a pretty great employee discount. I get 50% off, making the room rate $99 (normally $200!). I splurged on this hotel a little; it's nicer than where we would normally stay, but the tickets for the football game were an early Christmas gift for my boyfriend and I want it to be special. After taxes and fees, a daily ""resort fee"" of $9.95, and parking for one night ($18), the grand total is $142.87. Splurging pays off: We get a complimentary bottle of wine at check-in! $142.87 5:30 p.m. — I sent my mom tons of pictures of our hotel, and she tells me she wants to pay for us to have a nice dinner out! We're staying right in Inner Harbor, so there are tons of cute restaurants all within walking distance. She deposits $100 into my bank account, which is extremely generous of her. My boyfriend and I stop at the wine and cheese event the hotel is hosting on our way out to eat. We each get a glass of sangria and cheese, and then head out to eat. We walk around and survey our options, eventually landing at a burger restaurant and bar. It's really crowded, but somehow we're seated right away. We both order burgers, and each have a couple of beers while we watch college football. The bill comes to $89.09, which comes out of the account my mom deposited money into. 9 p.m. — We head back to the hotel. I'm exhausted! We get back in time for the hotel's nightcap event: s'mores and Grand Marnier. I make a s'more and my boyfriend sips some Grand Marnier. We head back to the room tipsy and head to bed. My boyfriend wants to make sure we're up early to start tailgating before the football game tomorrow. Daily Total: $142.87",1,110
"8:30 a.m. — My boyfriend and I wake up and get packed up and dressed for the game. I wish we were staying another night; this hotel is amazing! We head out to the breakfast spread, which has locally baked pastries, fresh fruit parfaits, and fresh juices. I grab an almond croissant, an oatmeal and yogurt parfait, and a cup of coffee. We finish eating and order an Uber. I figured it would be just as expensive to drive to the stadium and park, so I leave my car at the hotel and we hop in the Uber. $11.16 10:30 a.m. — We arrive at a bar that one of our friends recommended. We've never been to a Ravens game before and we're actually rooting for the opposing team. This bar is cool; there's an outdoor area with a DJ and booths selling drinks. It's a little chilly and they're selling spiked hot apple cider. I order one of those and my boyfriend gets a beer. It's cash only and I have no cash, so he pays. We have Orange Crushes and more beer, and then walk over to the stadium feeling pretty good! 1 p.m. — We get to the stadium just in time for kickoff. As we go through security, I learn that the NFL doesn't allow bags bigger than your hand inside the stadium, and mine is too big. They tell me I can put it in a locker outside the stadium, or throw it out. Ugh. We don't want to get out of line and then wait in it again. It was a cheap bag, so I toss it, but I'm not happy about this. How do you not give advance notice on the tickets for something like that?! We head up to our section and buy a few beers before finding our seats. $17.87 1:30 p.m. — We go back down to the concession level for a bathroom break. I see Dippin' Dots and get a serious craving even though it's 40 degrees out. I buy some while my boyfriend is in the bathroom. It's $8, which is ridiculous, but oh well. We grab chicken tenders and fries and my boyfriend gets another beer. I'm done drinking since I'm driving us back to my apartment after the game. $27.62 4 p.m. — The Ravens win. We head out of the game disappointed with the outcome and walk a few blocks away to get away from the craziness of the stadium. There, we grab an Uber to get my car from the hotel. $13.19 6 p.m. — We're on our way back to my apartment and need to figure out what we're doing for dinner. We're exhausted from a long couple of days and decide to order pizza for takeout from a place near my building. He calls and orders ahead and then runs in to get it. I throw him my debit card to pay, and while I'm sitting in the car waiting, I get a notification from my bank that my card was charged nearly $25. For one large pizza! That's kind of crazy to me. Oh well, I'm hungry and the weekend is almost over. We head back, hop in the shower, and watch a few episodes of . $24.72 Daily Total: $94.56",2,110
"9 a.m. — My boyfriend wakes up at 5 a.m. to drive back to school. I say a groggy goodbye to him and fall back asleep until around 7:30. I finally get up and get ready for work. I have nothing to eat for breakfast because I'm almost never home on the weekends, so I usually only grocery shop on weekdays. (Something that always haunts me on Mondays when there is nothing to eat.) I load $10 onto my Starbucks card and order ahead for a coffee and a bagel with cream cheese to pick up on my way to work. $10 11:30 a.m. — Monday morning is already pretty busy at work. I have a couple of meetings that run through lunch today. I know I'll be starving and cranky if I wait to eat until after it's over, so I head out to grab something early. There's a local, natural grocery store right by our office, which is a blessing and a curse. It's so convenient, but it is not cheap. I manage to find a pre-made ham and cheese wrap that has been discounted, and a brussels sprout and butternut squash salad. I head back to the office to pop the wrap in the fridge and eat a little bit of the salad before I head into my meetings. $7.54 1:30 p.m. — My second meeting wraps up and there are snacks! I snag a pastry and chocolate covered strawberries on the way out, feeling less hungry than I thought I would be. I eventually eat the second half of my sandwich and continue working through the rest of the day. 5:30 p.m. — I head out of the office, knowing I need to buy groceries so I don't keep buying lunch out. Normally, I go to Safeway or Trader Joe's and can keep my spending for the week around $25 to $30. Today, I don't feel like fighting the traffic to get to TJ's, so I walk back to the little grocery store by work. It is unreasonably expensive, but just so easy. I grab salad mix, chicken breast, an avocado, cucumber, spaghetti squash and pasta sauce, milk and cereal, and frozen eggplant. I'm a little disappointed in myself as I check out. I know I could have gotten the same things at another grocery store for much less. I get home and don't feel like cooking, so I eat leftover pizza from yesterday. $40.92 Daily Total: $58.46",3,110
"8 a.m. — Wake up and realize my direct deposit came into my ""spending"" bank account. I split my paycheck into two accounts: one that takes care of all of my bills, student loans, and rent. The other is my flex spending account that pays for pretty much everything else. Every time I get paid, I move whatever is left in my spending account over to my savings account. It usually ranges from $50 to $100 every paycheck. I also Venmo my boyfriend $40 for all the drinks he bought on Sunday. He texts me and tells me I didn't need to, but I don't mind. We're pretty flexible with who pays and always make up for it. $40 12 p.m. — I still have some of my salad and the other half of my sandwich from yesterday's lunch in the fridge. I head down to the café to eat with coworkers but finish my food feeling like it wasn't enough. Luckily, on my way back upstairs, I see that leftovers from a lunch meeting are up for grabs! I fix myself a small bowl of Qdoba leftovers and eat at my desk. 5 p.m. — One of our agencies is in town for a quarterly business review tomorrow. Tonight, they're taking us out to dinner! We head to the restaurant and find out we're early for our table, so a few of my coworkers and I head to the bar to grab a drink. We're seated and I order salmon over brussels sprouts and lentils. It's delicious. My coworkers continue to indulge in drinks but I told myself I was going to work out after this dinner. That doesn't end up happening, but at least I saved myself the calories. On the drive home, I remember I need to cook the chicken I bought yesterday. I make it on the stove while I vacuum and clean up the apartment. Daily Total: $40",4,110
"8 a.m. — I wake up and start getting ready for work. I pop an espresso pod in my Verismo machine and start frothing milk to make a latte. I sip it while I put on makeup and get dressed for the day and head to work. I'm really lucky that my commute only consists of a 10-minute drive. A lot of my coworkers live in D.C. and take the metro into Maryland where our office is. I decided to live close to work since I'm still new to the area. A 45-minute commute is considered ""normal"" here, but I don't know if I could do it. I told myself I'd move into the city when my lease was up, but it's way easier being close to the office. 10 a.m. — I head upstairs to grab coffee. It's time for our business review with our agency, which brought bagels and pastries from Panera. I grab half a bagel with cream cheese and half of a pastry and sit down for their presentation. 12 p.m. — Lunch arrives! I grab chicken, plantain, beans, and rice, and am so hungry that I eat it too fast. I sit uncomfortably through the rest of the presentation, wishing I hadn't. After the meeting, I work at my desk for the rest of the day. There are leftover beans and rice and I can't stop taking some. I've essentially eaten nothing but carbs today. 5:30 p.m. — I leave the office and head to Marshalls to get gift-wrapping supplies for Christmas presents. I'll be exchanging gifts with my boyfriend and his family over New Years. He's driving home from school and I'm flying out, so I want to give him the gifts now so I don't have to bring them on the plane. Normally, I raid my mom's stockpile of wrapping supplies for the holidays; this is the first year I'm on my own. I grab a roll of wrapping paper, a few gift bags, tags, and ribbon. I also end up getting a candle, a pink bodysuit that's on sale, and an eyeshadow palette that caught my eye while I'm shopping. The total comes out to over $50 (way more than I was expecting) but I have a gift card that brings the total down closer to $20. $21.53 7 p.m. — I get home and put away my purchases. I'm still kind of full from all the beans and rice, but I grab the last piece of leftover pizza from the fridge (more carbs, ugh). I'm mad at myself that it's Wednesday and I haven't gotten a workout in. Every night, I get home and feel like there aren't enough hours in the day! I hop in the shower, do a load of laundry while watching , and then get to sleep. Daily Total: $21.53",5,110
"7:30 a.m. — I wake up and get ready for work, and realize while I'm doing my makeup that I'm running low on my favorite foundation. I make a mental note to order more tonight. I eat an orange, make a salad for lunch, and am on my way. 6 p.m. — I'm home from work and head to my apartment's fitness facility to get a quick workout in. Then I head home and make spaghetti squash for dinner. While I eat, I remember that I need to buy more foundation. Ugh. Makeup is one of those items I feel really guilty about splurging on. With an enormous balance of student loan debt, I stress about spending money on any non-essential items. It's hard to find the balance between saving to put extra payments toward my loans, and still having fun without getting too hung up on being in debt. Urban Decay is having a 25% off sale, so I put my foundation in the cart along with my favorite concealer that I've also run out of, but hadn't been planning to repurchase. $42.30 Daily Total: $42.30",6,110
"7:30 a.m. — It's Friday; woo-hoo! I wake up and get ready for work, make a latte and a salad for lunch, and I'm out the door. I stop to get gas on the way in. I'm driving to visit my boyfriend tonight and need to get gas for the three-hour drive. I usually try to buy it when I'm down there because gas is often at least 20 cents cheaper, but I don't have enough in my tank to get me that far. I fill up just enough to get me where I need to go, and I'll refill up again down there. $13.42 11:30 a.m. — At 11 a.m., I am suddenly starving at my desk. I can't hold out until lunch. I get my salad from the fridge and hope nobody notices. Noon hits and I realize I need second lunch to make it through the day. I swing by the natural grocery store to buy a cup of soup and a wrap — both are discounted. I'll save the wrap for an on-the-go dinner in the car tonight. Head back to the office to eat. $7.43 6 p.m. — Home from work and I take a shower and get ready to hit the road to see my boyfriend. I prefer to wait until traffic dies down so I don't wasting time going nowhere, even if it means I don't get there until later. That also means the demand-based toll prices for the express lanes will be cheaper. When I'm about to leave, I realize I left the wrap I bought earlier for dinner in the fridge at work. Womp. It will be bad by Monday since it was already discounted. I scold myself and figure out what I'll eat instead. I stop at the Safeway by my apartment and pick up a pre-made turkey sandwich and an iced caramel macchiato to keep me awake. I use what's left on my Starbucks card for the coffee and pay for the rest with my debit card. Then, I'm off. $5.31 8:30 p.m. — I've made it to the land of cheaper gas! It's $2.19 a gallon here compared to $2.40 a gallon in my city. I fill up my tank and make it to my boyfriend's college apartment. While I was on my way, he picked up Captain and Coke for us, so we mix a few drinks. All of his friends are heading out, but we're feeling lazy and it's cold outside, so we stay in. After a long week at work, I feel too old to keep up with college kids even though I just graduated! $20.65 Daily Total: $46.81",7,110
"7:20 a.m. — Wake up and get kids ready for school. They need to be out of the door by 8 a.m. sharp, yet I can only get them out of bed at 7:30. I am fortunate to have my parents live with us, and my dad has breakfast ready when the family wakes up. He walks my daughter to school and my mom takes my son to preschool via subway. I normally leave home at 8:40 a.m., but today I have a global conference to attend at the Palace Hotel, so I'm out the door by 8:20. 4 p.m. — After six back-to-back meetings with different companies, I am exhausted. I walk back to my office, but it is hard to ignore the shops on 5th Avenue. I make a quick stop at Zara and buy two dresses. $150 5 p.m. — Back at my office. I check the Bloomberg terminal for stock prices and reply to emails. I have a full day of the conference again tomorrow and I have not prepared myself, ugh. I print out companies' presentations and analysts' reports to read tonight. I hate going to meetings under-prepared. I get home around 6:30 p.m. (it only takes 15 to 20 minutes), and that is considered late for me. Usually, I am home by 6. I make it a priority to have a relaxing dinner with my family 90% of the year. I usually leave before other people, but I hate face time. I read and play with the kids until 8:30. After that, I don't know where the time goes and am in bed by 10:30. Daily Total: $150",1,111
"7 a.m. — I was a bit late to the conference yesterday because I never budget time for train delays. The stress was not worth it, so I leave at 8 today and eat breakfast at the conference. Standard muffin, fruit bowl, and coffee. At least it's free. 12 p.m. — Lunch break, buffet style. The Palace Hotel has surprisingly good food. I get raisin walnut bread, salad with crab meat, grilled salmon with fingerling potatoes, and asparagus. I'm also making sure to sample two types of dessert each day: the tiramisu was good, but the chocolate cookie is average. I eat while listening to a long presentation on the global biotech outlook for 2018. 3 p.m. — I stop by Stuart Weitzman at Columbus Circle. My feet have widened after having two kids, and now only SW shoes are comfortable for me. I love their stretchy boots, but I can never buy them on sale because my sizes are always gone by then. $707.40 6 p.m. — I take the subway home. Dinner today is Vietnamese spring rolls, yum — but my husband refuses to eat because it's fried food. More for me! (We mostly cook at home and spend about $800/month.) After dinner, my daughter goes to a swim class with her father. They don't come back until 8:30 because swim, she is entitled to visit a dessert place. On swim day, both kids go to bed at 9:30 p.m. After that, I have just enough time to prepare myself for bed. Daily Total: $707.40",2,111
"7 a.m. — There's a publishing party at my daughter's school today so I take her to school. I have no time for breakfast and am starving by the time the publishing party is done at 9:30. 10:30 a.m. — I discover that I need to attend a conference in early January. I am probably the last person to register, and it seems like the whole investment community will be there. Luckily, I get the last room left near the conference for $600/night. That same room will cost ""only"" $200 any other time. Unfortunately, all the business class flights are also sold out so I will fly economy. ($4,300 expensed) 12 p.m. — I plan to fly my family out to join me over the long MLK Jr. weekend. While I'm at the conference, my husband can take the kids explore the city for two days. Then I will join them for the long weekend, and we can take a day trip and a weekend trip to the beach. Flights for them cost $660, but hotels on Saturday, Sunday, and Monday are ""free"" because I have lots of hotel points. (Otherwise, it would cost us $850 plus tax.) $660 3 p.m. — I have a meeting with the CEO of an insurance company followed by another meeting with a pharmaceutical analyst. After, I need to do a few write-ups on investment ideas I got from the conference yesterday. 7 p.m. — We meet up with a group of my husband's friends for dinner at a fusion restaurant in Union Square. The restaurant only opened a few months ago and the food is good; I overeat as usual. $160 10 p.m. — My son is still awake when we get home and because he napped earlier. I read to him and we both go to bed by 11 p.m. Daily Total: $820",3,111
"9:30 a.m. — I have my first meeting of the day. Today is not too busy, only two meetings total, but some of my investments are not doing well. I need to finish up my write-up and Excel models. 12 p.m. — I attend a luncheon with Girls Who Code at Bank of America, and get seated next to a very arrogant male hedge fund managers, which kind of ruins the mood. Still, the speaker is passionate and funny, and I will definitely encourage my daughter to code. I can't really help her though because I got a C+ in my college coding class. 7 p.m. — I have a conference call with an overseas company at 7, so my husband takes the kids to our building's playroom where they can be loud. Later in the evening, after putting them to bed, I enjoy my time planning our trip to Asia next year. I've gone to a conference in Asia every year for the past 10 years, and this is the first time my husband will join me toward the end of my work trip. My flight and I hotels are expensed ($6,500 for the business class flights and $3,000 for the hotels). 11 p.m. — My husband and I are celebrating our 10th anniversary in 2018, so we ""deserve"" a trip without the kids. We'll spend three days in Tokyo, two nights in Hakone (known for their onsen, or mineral hot springs) at a ryokan (traditional Japanese house with homemade meals), and four days in Kyoto. It is so hard to choose a hotel because they are all rated highly by travelers. That's Japanese hospitality for you. I finally book my husband's economy flight ($1,100) and our accommodations in Hakone and Kyoto ($1,500). The hotels are not fancy, but are in a central location. $2,600 Daily Total: $2,600",4,111
"8 a.m. — I take my son to school today. His grandma said he has been fussing and did not want to go to school, but he seems very happy when I take him. He knows how to push our buttons to get what he wants. 12 p.m. — I am taken out to lunch by my favorite salesperson and good friend. We often go to 15 East in Union Square, and it is absolutely the best sushi place in New York. We do omakase at the sushi counter and chat about work, life, vacations, and girly stuff. ($200 expensed) My friend will also join me during my work trip to Asia, as she has for the last 10 years. She is nine years older with two kids but we are on the same wavelength. (And in fact, most of my friends are older than me.) 9 p.m. — After the kids are in bed, my husband books a car to drive to Maryland for Christmas ($800), and I book a one-night hotel stay in Washington, D.C. for my family and his sister's family. The hotels are surprisingly cheap and there are so many choices. I am a Hyatt loyalist and find two studio-suites for $203.50 each per night. $1,207 Daily Total: $1,207",5,111
"9:30 a.m. — After my daughter's piano lesson, my husband rents a car and we drive 45 minutes outside of the city to the Palisades Mall. We previously bought a multi-visit pass to Billy Beez, so we head there first. Our kids spend hours climbing in several story-high jungle gyms and bouncing around. $120 12:30 p.m. — We have lunch at The Cheesecake Factory. I always thought that place only had desserts, but boy, I was wrong. The menu is huge and kids end the meal with two different slices of cake. $80 2 p.m. — After lunch, my daughter goes on the merry-go-round. My son is too chicken for it, but he loves the indoor Ferris wheel and I ride that with him. (The rides cost $20.) After, we go back to Billy Beez for more climbing, bouncing, and jumping. $20 4:30 p.m. — It's time to go home. I spot a newly opened Kung Fu Tea at the mall and stop by. I love bubble tea! Two drinks to go, please. $10 Daily Total: $230",6,111
"10 a.m. — We take my son to a birthday party at a New York kids' club, and I bring a present ($30). The party lasts two hours, and the kids have lots of fun. Lunch is catered: pizza, sandwiches, and appetizers for the adults, and pizza and cake for the kids. $30 2 p.m. — We take the kids to a friend's apartment for a playdate. I bring a gingerbread house kit and all the baking ingredients ($20) since, apparently, my husband's friends do not cook or bake. The kids have a blast cracking eggs, mixing cupcake batter, and decorating a just-out-of-the-oven cupcake we make with lots of icing and sprinkles. They want to eat the gingerbread house too, but that would be too much candy, so I tell them no. My friend's building has a pool and we burn off our extra energy there before heading home. $20 7 p.m. — It's Grandma's (my mom's) birthday today and we celebrate at a restaurant. My daughter makes a beautiful birthday card and my son loves singing ""Happy Birthday"". We have a homemade birthday cake (Grandma loves baking!) that is better than most (even Magnolia) — but not Lady M level! The kids are in bed by 10. I am exhausted. $150 Daily Total: $200",7,111
"6:30 a.m. — I struggle out of bed. I'm definitely not a morning person. Dragon (our 75-pound pit bull-mastiff cuddle machine) doesn't want to get out of bed either, but he needs to be walked before I go to work, or I'll regret his energy level later. We do a lap around the park! 9:15 a.m. — I work for a tech company and we've got tons of snacks and coffee at the office. I grab a banana and coffee and start working. Lots of meetings and tasks to power through this morning. 12:30 p.m. — I'm starving and it's my lucky day: Our team is testing out new caterers. Our office has catered lunch on Wednesdays, but our current caterers have been hit or miss on quality. I'm pretty skeptical of the sparse salad bar the test caterer brings, but it turns out to be super tasty and filling — and they bring very delicious chocolate-chip cookies. I hope they get added to our rotation. 5 p.m. — My husband calls and tells me the Yankees-Indians game we were going to tonight has been postponed until tomorrow night because of rain. Unfortunately, we are already booked tomorrow night with a charity fundraiser event! We are originally from Ohio though, so I know my husband really wants to go to the Indians game. Screw it. We'll go to the baseball game charity event. We repurchase baseball tickets. $122.27 6:30 p.m. — We already paid for a dog walker this evening, so we decide to go out to dinner. It was our four-year wedding anniversary a month ago, and we tried to go to Hart's in Brooklyn but they were booked. We decide to try getting in again ... and of course, it's an hour wait. The restaurant is tiny, so we go to the bar next door for a drink while we wait. I order a wine, and my husband gets a beer. $20 6:45 p.m. — We get called back to the restaurant after 15 minutes. I chug my wine and we head over. I'm already drunk off the glass of wine I chugged, so we order a ton of food! Two appetizers, two entrees, and dessert. The food's pretty good but my husband and I agree that the previous restaurant in the same space had a more interesting menu. I recommend the clam toast, though. $152.43 10:30 p.m. — We Uber home. $8.50 Daily Total: $303.20",1,112
"6:30 a.m. — The struggle is real, but it's a running day, so I have to get up. In May, my mom was diagnosed with cholangiocarcinoma, a rare and aggressive bile duct cancer. She passed away in July, and I've started running to help manage my grief. Plus, I hope to get to a point where I'm able to do a charity run. I'm using a subscription app to that says it can take you ""from couch potato to 5K."" So far, it's working. 9:15 a.m. — On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, we have cold brew on tap in our office lobby. I grab a Stumptown Nitro and a banana and get to work! 12 p.m. — Today's a catered-lunch day in the office. I eat light because I know I'm going to binge on stadium food at the baseball game. It's really the only reason I agreed to go to the game! 3:30 p.m. — My husband and I head up to Yankee Stadium. We will be the best dressed people there since we're wearing our cocktail attire for the charity event after. (Yep, my husband is in a full suit.) Once we arrive, I immediately get a ridiculously overpriced beer and hot dog — it's wonderful! I guess there's also a baseball game going on ... but I make a second trip for another hot dog and cheese fries. I've been waiting all day for this! $58.25 6:30 p.m. — We don't get to see the whole game but the Indians were winning when we left! We head back downtown for the cocktail charity event, which is raising money for various charity affiliates around the world. We mingle, drink, and listen to live music. There's a silent auction and I force my husband to bid on tickets to with Bette Midler. It's Bette Midler; she's amazing! I can't even think about without crying. In the end, we're outbid. I wish we had the funds for a bidding war, but we don't. Instead, we donate to the foundation. $100 10:30 p.m. — My feet hurt like hell from my heels so we Uber home. $36.96 Daily Total: $195.21",2,112
"6:30 a.m. — It's a dog walk day. Dragon and I take a lap around the park, then I head into work. 9:15 a.m. — I'm in my normal routine: coffee, cereal, and get to work. We have a four-day weekend this week as a Summer Friday perk, so I'm slammed trying to cram work in. 12 p.m. — Hungry! My coworker and I head to Whole Foods for sushi. I know their sushi is expensive, but the other sushi place nearby can sometimes be a bit ""off,"" and I don't mind paying the extra few dollars. $15 8:30 p.m. — I pick up the dog and husband and head to dinner at Sauvage with my dad and sister. It has been a very hard summer for all of us. Since my mom passed away, I've been making a point not to take my loved ones for granted, and spend as much time with them as possible. We order tons of food, and my wonderful dad pays. Daily Total: $15",3,112
"6:30 a.m. — Even though I have the day off, it's a run day. So, I get up and go. 11 a.m. — Dragon and I chill around the house and pack. Tonight, we are headed to East Stroudsburg, PA to go canoeing down the Delaware river tomorrow. We try to go canoeing at least once a year. I'm a high-stress person and canoeing calms me. 5 p.m. — My husband's home! We load up our Jeep and are on our way. We make a pit stop for beer (canoe + beer = ca-brewing) and a granola bar. $15.36 7 p.m. — Traffic in the Holland Tunnel was awful, and this trip is taking forever. The granola bar wasn't enough and I'm in a hangry rage. Thankfully, we see an exit with a Cracker Barrel. Their chicken and dumplings are too good to pass up! Since we have Dragon with us, we order take-out. Pro tip: You can order take-out and eat al fresco on their rocking chairs and it's delightful! I'm a sucker for their general store and buy Badger Sleeping Balm ($6.99), chocolate covered coffee beans, and chocolate covered marshmallows. $43.64 9 p.m. — We arrive at the Super 8 and get their last pet-friendly room, but unfortunately, there are two double beds. That means my husband gets his own bed and Dragon and I share. Dragon refuses to sleep alone. $114 Daily Total: $173",4,112
"8 a.m. — Uh-oh. It's cold and the weatherman is calling for rain in the afternoon. We get ready fast and head out for canoeing to beat the rain. 9 a.m. — We stop by Dunkin' Donuts for breakfast, and I order a donut and a coffee. It's my lucky day because they accidentally give me two! $7.17 9:15 a.m. — Our canoe trip will take around five hours, so we stop by Subway for sandwiches for lunch later. I make my own salami and veggie creation and grab chips. $10.25 10 a.m. — We've got our canoe rented and loaded up. We strap on Dragon's lifejacket and off we go! Dragon swims like a rock, so he loves the safety of the canoe. The river is so peaceful and quiet. It's pretty chilly and early, so there's no one out but us. $100 12 p.m. — We pull up to shore to let Dragon run around in the woods and eat lunch. Dragon goes nuts racing everywhere and splashing in the river. It's too frickin' cute. 3 p.m. — We are off the river and headed home. My husband saw that we passed a Dairy Queen on our way here and wants to stop for ice cream. It's cold, so I order a hot fudge sundae and a small vanilla for Dragon. $8 3:15 p.m. — There's a DIY car wash next to DQ and our car is in bad need of an interior and exterior cleaning. We load up on quarters and I go hard on cleaning. $20 6 p.m. — We're back in Brooklyn, surprisingly sunburned and sore-armed from paddling. We order Chinese food and work on a puzzle. Yes, puzzling is cheesy but it's so relaxing — and we're doing a Botticelli painting. $65 Daily Total: $210.42",5,112
"8:30 a.m. — My husband's pretty religious and I support him by going to church with him. Plus, I'm not opposed to learning. We stop for pastries and coffee at Paris Baguette before church starts. $10 2:30 p.m. — Cleaning and cooking all afternoon. I also really need to stop puzzling. 8 p.m. — We were home all day, so we decide to go to Barboncino for dinner. It's a 20-minute wait, so we grab a drink at the bar. They pour me what is essentially a bowl of wine for $9. Not bad. I highly recommend their soppressata pizza with hot honey. Salty and sweet! $88.60 Daily Total: $98.60",6,112
"6:30 a.m. — I have the day off for Labor Day, but it's a run day — my longest run yet and I'm nervous. I even had an anxiety riddled dreams about it. But to my surprise, I do it, and it isn't that bad. There must be something to this interval training. 9 a.m. — We own our house and my husband and I have been slowly renovating it ourselves. Right now, we are tiling our bathroom. The tiles for our shower floor are too big for our shower slope so, we head to Home Depot. After much searching, we find the perfect-sized marble mosaic hexagons. We pick up a few more supplies and head home. $206 12 p.m. — My husband and I argue about the placement of the tile for a while before we start making the cuts. If we don't get the shower right and end up with leaks, we'll be screwed out of all the time and money we've already put into it. Finally, all the floor tiles are dry-laid. 8 p.m. — We are tired from the weekend. We decide to stay in and order dinner. There's a Thai place I'm obsessed with even though it's kind of pricey. We order pad see ew and basil chicken. Movies and puzzling for the rest of the night. $57 Daily Total: $263",7,112
"10 a.m. — Start my day as I always do: catching up with the news and blogs while drinking a double cappuccino and a strawberry-banana smoothie with a scoop of powdered collagen (good for the skin, hair, and nails). The beautiful thing about working from home is that I get to make my own schedule and wake up as late as I want. I am a night person, so this works perfectly for me! 11 a.m. — Still in my PJs, I settle into my home office for a productive day of writing. Today's assignment: the 10 hottest vegan spots in Miami. As I research the topic online, it dawns on me that I haven't been to most of these places! Time to tap into my PR contacts and see if I can score some free media dinners in exchange for coverage. I know this is not the most ethical approach to journalism, but the publication I work for doesn't cover my food spending, so I have to be resourceful to avoid spending all my budget on eating out. I email a few PR peeps and hope for the best. 1 p.m. — Start to get hungry, and I head to my fridge to consider my options. Even though I know a lot about food, I cannot cook to save my life, so my meals at home are pretty basic and, for the most part, healthy to counterbalance all my dinners out. I make a salad with arugula, feta cheese, tomatoes, bean sprouts, cauliflower rice, and canned tuna, and have a coconut popsicle for dessert. 1:15 p.m. — Mid-salad, I realize that I'm late for a phone interview with a chef for a big article that I'm working on. D'oh! As the reminder pops up on my phone, I scramble to put some questions together before calling the guy. I remind myself that this is Miami, and people are rarely on time for meetings anyway. 1:35 p.m. — Well, that was awkward! The chef barely gave me any details on his new restaurant, other than the info that is already shared on the website. My editor is going to be pissed, as she wanted to get the scoop beyond the facts on the press release. I'm probably going to have to go speak with him in-person to get more deets. 3 p.m. — Spend the rest of the afternoon working on my vegan story, leaving the dish recommendation portion blank for now. I get a response from a PR girl agreeing to set up a free media dinner in exchange for coverage. Score! I immediately accept and schedule it for tomorrow at lunch. 5 p.m. — Gym time! I take a spinning lesson with a friend, and she convinces me to grab a drink after at a Spanish restaurant nearby. 6:30 p.m. — Despite my best efforts to only have one glass, I end up getting three big glasses of sangria plus a few appetizers. Hey, at least they're on the happy-hour menu. $25 8:30 p.m. — I drop off my car at my friend's place nearby and take an Uber home. There is no way I'm driving after all that wine! Plus, Uber just launched a new flat-fee promo, so I pay only $10 for the activation fee, and get $5 rides for the rest of the month! This is the perfect deal for me as I tend to drink a lot when I eat out, and it's way safer than driving myself. $15 9 p.m. — After that drinking, all hopes of having a productive night of writing go out the window. I settle in on the couch and watch season 2 of . 12 a.m. — Time for bed! Daily Total: $40",1,113
"10 a.m. — I eat the same breakfast as yesterday as I go through our competitors' sites to see what's new. I see that one of them has covered a story I'm supposed to publish next week. Ugh! I hate it when that happens. I email my editor and suggest postponing my story by a few weeks to keep me from looking like a copycat. They better not write one on vegan spots, or all of yesterday's work will have been for nothing. 11 a.m. — Quick shower and then I start getting ready for my media lunch at the vegan spot. Luckily, I'm allowed to bring a plus one, so I invite my best friend to join me. 12 p.m. — I Uber there since my car is still at my friend's house. $5 12:30 p.m. — The vegan spot is fabulous! The food is creative, the portions are generous, and the whole meal is surprisingly filling (which rarely happens at these kinds of eateries). We order jackfruit tacos, edamame cakes, a bean burger, gluten-free pizza, grapefruit mousse, and wash it down with smoothies. I take notes on my cell phone of all my faves. The chef comes out to greet us and share a bit more about the concept behind the restaurant, giving me some great info for my article. We finish most of the meal and take some to-go for later. Although the meal is free, we leave a generous $40 tip. I pay in cash, and my friend immediately Venmos me her share. $20 2:30 p.m. — My friend drops me off at home, where I sit for several hours of writing. 6 p.m. — Uber to the gym for another spinning class. I meet my friend again, but we skip the drinks this time and head directly to her place to rescue my car after the workout. $5 8 p.m. — Snack on some of my leftover gluten-free pizza from today's lunch. It tastes ever better cold! I scramble some eggs and call it dinner. 9 p.m. — Watch a few more episodes of , while I text with a cute Puerto Rican guy from Tinder. We've never met in person, but I invite him to a media dinner I have on Thursday. I don't normally like to do this on first dates (I would prefer for the guy to wine and dine me, versus the opposite!) but it's at a romantic Italian restaurant, and I can't resist. 11:30 p.m. — Bedtime.

"8 a.m. — I'm woken up earlier than usual because of the arrival of the termite guy. He is here to inspect our building, but I totally forgot that was happening today! I open the door for him, still half asleep, and let him do his thing as I prepare my usual breakfast. 9 a.m. — Phew! I'm termite-free. I celebrate by munching on a chocolate-peanut butter KIND bar from my pantry. 10 a.m. — A few more PR people get back to me about my vegan restaurant outreach. One of them extends an invite for a media dinner, but the other declines, saying they are not doing any media promotion at the moment. I guess I will not be featuring them in my story! I delete their mention from my Microsoft Word document, and schedule a dinner at the other place for this Friday. 12 p.m. — Stop by Publix and buy baby kale, cherry tomatoes, sweet peppers, cucumbers, apples, bananas, strawberries, fresh salmon, Greek yogurt, coconut ice cream popsicles, Pepperidge Farm dulce de leche cookies, and cleaning supplies. $56 1:30 p.m. — Make my specialty for lunch: foil-wrapped, baked salmon with Dijon mustard, olive oil, and honey. I pair it with quinoa and salad. 2:30 p.m. — I receive an email from my editor in New York following up on my chef interview. I buy some time but promise to submit it by tomorrow, which means I'll have to drop by the restaurant today to get the scoop. I call the restaurant, and it looks like the chef will be in for the afternoon, so I let them know I'll be coming by for ""photos"" and more questions. 3:20 p.m. — Make it to the restaurant and get to meet the chef in person. He is way cuter than his headshot, and friendlier than he was over the phone. I ask a few questions and the conversation is flowing nicely. He makes a few jokes and offers to let me try some of his dishes. I don't oppose. We share yellowtail ceviche and grilled octopus over jokes about Miami restaurant clichés. I get a slight suspicion that he might be flirting with me, but I keep it professional. I do my tasting, get my answers, and head home. Of course, I give him my business card at the end so the ball is on his court now... 4:30 p.m. — Feeling inspired back at home, I finish the article in a matter of hours. I submit it to my editor for review, and hope she likes it, since she's been pestering me about this thing for days now. 8:30 p.m. — I'm not very hungry after my mid-afternoon ceviche, so I munch on fresh strawberries and yogurt as I watch an old episode of on YouTube.

I make a cappuccino to-go, and I'm out the door. 9:30 a.m. — After a quick shower at the gym, I head to a new café that just opened in Wynwood. I snap a few pictures for my publication's Instagram account and try their cold brew and a donut. The coffee is good, full-bodied with chocolate notes. The donut is not fresh, but I eat it anyway. I take notes on my iPhone and give them a mental three-star review. $11 10 a.m. — The Puerto Rican guy from Tinder texts me to confirm our date for tonight. He's a bit of a foodie and is pretty excited! I confirm our plans and propose to meet at the restaurant at 8 p.m. 10:30 a.m. — Stop by my salon for a quick Brazilian wax. I don't know where the night will take us tonight, and I don't want to get caught unprepared! It's painful, but totally worth it. $35 12 p.m. — I eat some of yesterday's salmon leftovers for lunch. I try to keep it light, as I think about the handmade gnocchi I'm going to order at the restaurant tonight... 2 p.m. — Spend some time responding to emails and working on a new story on Miami's best empanadas. 4 p.m. — I get an email from my editor congratulating me on the chef interview. She really liked it! What a relief. The story gets published and gets some great comments from readers on Twitter. Yes! I close my laptop and decide to call it a day. 7 p.m. — I start getting ready for my hot date. I do my hair and makeup, and choose a cute but chill outfit so that he doesn't think I'm too high maintenance. Jeans, a nice top, heels, and I'm out the door. 7:45 p.m. — Uber to the restaurant. Starting to get butterflies in my stomach! $5 8 p.m. — OMG, he is freaking hot! Tall, dark, and handsome, just like I like them. He is also funny and smart, and we have a great time. I try to show off by schmoozing with the chef and ordering almost every item on the menu because, after all, that's what media tastings are for! We order several rounds of cocktails, and by the time we get to the tiramisu, I'm quite tipsy. The dinner is comped, but he offers to pay for the tip, which I accept. 11 p.m. — My date drives me home and asks if he can come over, which I don't oppose. I don't usually do this on the first date, especially with people I've met online, but I feel a bit of a connection with him, and the whole night has been so perfect. I feel I would regret it if I didn't! We cuddle on the couch and watch some comedy shows on Netflix, and then proceed to have a steamy make-out session ... and a little more. Daily Total: $51",4,113

After he leaves, I go back to bed, feeling #blessed about being able to work from home in my PJs for the rest of the day. 11 a.m. — Finally roll out of bed, way later than my usual time. I blame it on the wine, and the sexy guy who kept me up all night. I make a smoothie, a coffee, and keep an eye on my phone to see if I get any texts from him. 2 p.m. — Still no text, but I do get an email from the chef I interviewed earlier this week, thanking me for the article I wrote. He wants to show his thanks by taking me out to dinner this weekend, so I guess he was flirting with me after all! 2 p.m. — Join a webinar on how to take food pictures on your iPhone. It's pretty basic, but I learn a few tricks here and there that make it worth it in the end. 4 p.m. — I make a late lunch of scrambled eggs on a toasted arepa with avocado. 7 p.m. — Still no text from Tinder guy! Should I be worried? I try to get my mind off the subject by starting a new series: . It's good, and I end up watching way more episodes than I expected until I fall asleep. Daily Total: $0",5,113

Starting to feel desperate with the lack of texting, I decide to accept the chef's invitation to dinner. Hey, I have to keep my options open ... plus, he was super cute! $14 12 p.m. — Stop by the mall in search of a gift for my mom's birthday next week, and I end up going to Nordstrom and buying a beautiful leather jacket. It's not even fall yet, but it is their anniversary sale, so I end up getting it for $100 less than the regular price. I don't usually spend this much on clothes, but I justify the splurge by telling myself that it's a classic piece that will last me for a long time. $240 3 p.m. — Back at home, I feel guilty from my Nordstrom splurge and start going through my recent purchases to see what I can return. I find two (unworn) sweaters that I recently bought online and prepare the UPS package to send them back for a refund. 6 p.m. — Drive downtown to meet up with my girlfriends for happy hour. 6:30 p.m. — Happy-hour sushi and lychee martinis with the girls. I'm thirsty and can barely taste the alcohol in these drinks, and end up drinking three. Oops. $28 8:30 p.m. — Happy hour is over, so we move on to a wine bar nearby. Some jazz, a cheese platter, and two glasses of Sauvignon Blanc later, and I am ready for bed. $27 11:30 p.m. — No way I'm driving tonight! I leave the car parked on the street and Uber home. $5 12 p.m. — Chug water and go to bed. Ugh, tomorrow is going to be rough. Daily Total: $314",6,113
"10 a.m. — Usual cappuccino and smoothie for breakfast. 12 p.m. — My family is Latin so it is customary for us to get together every Sunday for lunch. I head to my parents' house in South Miami and buy a fruit tart at The Fresh Market for dessert on the way. $10 1 p.m. — Chicken and rice lunch with the fam. Nothing beats my mom's food! She knows I can't cook, so she always makes an extra tray that we can all take home for the week. Thanks, Mama! 5 p.m. — Fill up my gas tank for less than $35. Gotta love my little Nissan! $34 7 p.m. — Leftover chicken and rice for dinner. 8 p.m. — After three days of not hearing back from the Puerto Rican, I decide to accept the chef's dinner invitation. We agree to see each other on Wednesday at a hot, new Thai place in South Beach where he knows the owner.

Make two cups of vanilla-flavored coffee at home while watching . A normal breakfast for me is coffee, black. If I'm feeling ""fun,"" I add a splash of Whole Foods organic coconut milk. 10 a.m. — Arrive at work and realize it's Monday — bagel day. I saunter over and grab an onion bagel with chive cream cheese. I smell amazing, I'm sure. I didn't pack a lunch today, which is totally fine with me because I've been craving Mexican food since the day I left for China. 12 p.m. — Go to our company's café for a team lunch. We have a team lunch almost every day to get away from our computer screens. The soups at our café are to die for. I pick up a large beef chili and two wheat rolls. $4 4:30 p.m. — Quitting time. Proud of myself for not crawling under my desk to nap. Prepare to brave Bay Area traffic and head home. 7:30 p.m. — Meet a friend at a local bar for some much-needed drinks and catch-up time. I have two Old Fashioneds and planned to skip dinner (no appetite) until I saw the brie on the next table. Sold. I order brie with apricot jam and toasted bread, and am one happy camper.

Our office provides us with fresh fruit every morning. 10:15 a.m. — Open my computer to glance at the news, and find out that my favorite boutique is having a sale. The dress I've been eyeing for about a month is now 25% off. I take it as a sign from the fashion gods and quickly check out. $63 12 p.m. — Scold myself again for not bringing a sandwich for lunch, and go out with the group again to our café. Since I have an addiction to the soups, I grab a small broccoli and cheddar. $3 4:30 p.m. — Rush home from work. I have just enough time to pet my kitten and change into my swimsuit for swim practice. I quickly chug water and head out. 7 p.m. — Driving home from practice and thinking about what I want to make for dinner. I went grocery shopping on Sunday and bought ground turkey, sweet onions, eggs, cheddar cheese, broccoli, tomatoes, brown rice, black beans, wheat bread, sliced turkey, sweet potatoes, salmon, and of course a few bottles of cabernet sauvignon. I make faux-fried rice with scrambled eggs, onions, rice, and beans. Oddly enough, I don't crack open the wine. 8:30 p.m. — At this point, I'm exhausted and convinced that I'm slowly dying from jet lag. Crawl into bed, praying I can sleep tonight. Fingers crossed!

(My apartment complex has one; it's included in my ridiculously overpriced rent.) 8 a.m. — Make a cup of coffee and hop in the shower to get ready for work. 10 a.m. — Arrive at work and make tea. Our work provides an assortment of different kinds. I swear by Yogi Soothing Rose Hibiscus Skin Detox Tea. I rarely find a tea that I like, and after I found this one, I was hooked. Not only does it make your skin radiant and glow, it tastes like heaven. 12 p.m. — I quickly grab a salad from the café and eat at my desk. $6 6:30 p.m. — Meet up with my boyfriend. He knows about my intense desire for a burrito after returning from China, so we grab them from Whole Foods. Our Whole Foods in San Jose has a brewery attached to it, so we make the burritos and head upstairs to eat them on the outdoor terrace. He pays for the welcome-back burritos.

Isn't it funny how when you try for months to get together with old friends, something always seems to come up, but on a random day, at a spur-of-the-moment time, everyone can attend? We have traditional Mexican food. I split the check with them. $26 5 p.m. — Freedom! I'm meeting my boyfriend after work to discuss what we want to do for the evening. I've been trying to build up my bar cart with non-well liquors for when I'm feeling fancy. We stroll to BevMo together, where he suggests a reserve whiskey, and I pick out a botanical gin, too. I'm learning how to make a kickass Old Fashioned, and this whiskey should do the trick. $78 6 p.m. — After we leave BevMo, we realize we need limes and oranges. We walk next door to Safeway to pick up a few pieces of fruit, ice, sugar cubes, and roasted chicken for dinner. I split the cost with him. $15 7:30 p.m. — Cocktail hour officially begins. My boyfriend shows me how to make a basic Old Fashioned, and I choose gin for the night.

Part of me scolds myself because I knew buying a luxury car would mean I'd have higher maintenance costs, but part of me also hopes I can leave unscathed. A girl can dream, right? 8:15 a.m. — Drop off my car at the dealership. It's my 20,000-mile maintenance service, so it's a rough cost. Ouch. Yes, I will help myself to all the coffee and muffins at this price. $506 9 a.m. — Like a newbie, I assumed the service would take an hour or two. They tell me it'll take three or four hours, and I didn't sign up for a loaner car. My boyfriend offers to pick me up and drive me to work. I drink as much coffee as I can. 9:30 a.m. — Get to work and have one more cup. Happy Friday! 12 p.m. — I've been terrible at packing lunch this week. How many things can I blame on jet lag? I scold myself, again, and go with the team for lunch. I love my team, so I would honestly love to eat with them every day, if it were feasible. Salad bar, here I come. $6 3 p.m. — Friday freedom feels. My manager notices me typing away like a zombie and tells me to head home to rest up, since I've been traveling for the past three weeks. She's the best. This week has left me mentally drained, not to mention sleep-deprived.

The Man. Karaoke time to wake me up. 10:30 a.m. — Arrive at my friend's apartment in SF and immediately pop open a bottle of rosé before we head to brunch. I bought the wine a while ago, and it has been sitting in my fridge. Small traditions like this make me the happiest. 12:30 p.m. — Catch a Lyft to go to The Tipsy Pig in the Marina District. It's a gorgeous day out so hopefully they have patio seating available. Slim chance, though. We split the Lyft cost. $5 1:30 p.m. — Arrive at the brunch spot and to our surprise, they can seat us right away! I order a Bombay Sapphire and tonic (extra limes are a must), plus the house burger, which is amazing. After eating, we order another round of drinks and head to the patio area to bask in the sunshine. When the bill comes, we split it. $63 2:30 p.m. — We move on to another bar, Stock in Trade. People-watching at this bar is the best. There's usually a flock of ""Marina"" guys wearing loafers and spewing the dumbest pickup lines to every girl in the bar. We order another round, and I stick to a gin martini this time. (My mom still can't believe gin is my drink of choice. ""But it tastes like Pine-Sol."" Love her.) $14 4:30 p.m. — We are both oddly tired for a Saturday in the city and decide to pick up another bottle of rosé and head back home, with heads held high that we made it out and were social at all.

I'm obsessed with this little town and like to pretend I live there. Unfortunately, it's one of the most expensive cities in the U.S. Being the independent lady that I am, I offer to split the bill but he politely refuses and pays for brunch. 1 p.m. — We spontaneously decide to take a drive and head to a winery for a tasting in LG. We taste five wines. I'm a spicy cabernet sauvignon person, and they are known for their pinot noirs. My boyfriend suggests we buy a bottle of wine to drink in the future. He pays for the tasting and the bottle. I relish those times when chivalry isn't completely dead. 5 p.m. — We head back to my apartment to crack open the bottle and watch a terrible sci-fi movie we both enjoy. Awful, silly movies are my forte. 10 p.m. — I kiss the boyfriend goodbye, and he heads home. He leaves for Beijing in the morning, and I crawl into bed with my cat.

I wake up feeling kind of sick and want to try and nip it in the bud, so I chug a not-great-tasting ACV concoction using ingredients from our kitchen and head back to bed. 10:30 a.m. — After sleeping in a bit longer, I wake up feeling better and more energetic. We spend time cleaning the apartment and then head to brunch in the neighborhood. As neither of us is in the mood to wait, we get there as they open at 11 a.m. I order a delicious leek and chèvre scramble that comes with a side of baby lettuce and toast. J. orders a burger and we both just drink water. The bill comes to $41.90 before tip and we split it evenly. $24.69 1 p.m. — We decide to walk off brunch and wander into a nearby neighborhood, where we find a particularly good coffee shop. I recently switched from coffee to matcha to help heal a few skin issues, so I resist a latte and order matcha and water on ice (yawn). J. orders an iced latte and pays for both of us. 3 p.m. — After coffee, we stop at an art supply store to buy air-dry clay to make a pot for a plant — my attempt to start a fun project later today. (That ends up being wishful thinking. At the end of the week, the clay still sits in its original packaging, untouched.) $8.84 4 p.m. — The walk home was long, and hot. We pass one of our favorite ice cream shops and can't resist going inside. We both buy two scoops; I pay for both of us since he paid for coffee earlier. $9.90 5 p.m. — We're finally back home and decide to be somewhat productive. Together, we make lunches for the next two days with groceries we have in the fridge: roasted veggies and grilled chicken it is. For dinner, we heat up a frozen pizza from Roberta's, and end the day with a good-old Netflix binge. season 2, thank you for existing.

I leave the rest for J., and leave to take the train to work. My commute is about an hour long, and usually I use that time to get some work done, but today I read a little bit more of a book I've been ""reading"" for months. 12 p.m. — It's lunchtime and I'm hungry! The veggies and grilled chicken I made yesterday are good but scarce, and I'll have to add something else to tomorrow's lunch. The rest of my work day involves a series of meetings in preparation for the start of the school year. I power through the rest of the day and leave as soon as I can, taking the train home and playing around on my phone. 4:30 p.m. — Back at home, I go straight to the fridge for a snack. I pick Greek yogurt and top it with cinnamon, almonds, raw oats, and flax seeds. After, I change into gym clothes and walk to the gym, three blocks away, for a HIIT class (a.k.a., the last thing I want to do right now). 7:30 p.m. — On the way back home, I check the mail and see I've received a $34.25 check for a bag I sold online! I shower and relax a bit before bed, noticing that my precious skin products are running super low — that means an expensive purchase is lurking. I should probably order now but can't bring myself to do it. I didn't spend ANY money today, which is unheard of, and I don't want to ruin it now!

I make a cup of hot matcha and add collagen powder and tocos, all for the sake of my skin. I do love how early it is right now, but have to start adjusting to getting up at this time for the start of the school year. Tomorrow, students will be coming back and there's still a lot to prepare. I get dressed quickly and head out the door, all before J. is out of bed. 6:45 a.m. — When I swipe my MetroCard at the train station, I'm swiftly reminded that it's empty. Buying a monthly unlimited card is probably the smartest move, but I can't stomach the $136 fee today and add $40 instead. This slight delay causes me to miss my usual train and I have to wait for the next one. $41.40 12 p.m. — I still have lunch left over from Sunday's meal prep. I eat grilled chicken, roasted veggies, and black beans that I added in. I also brought some almonds. 4 p.m. — After work, I pick up almond milk, bananas, and a pack of kale from the grocery store. J. and I are really good at splitting any food/apartment costs, so he sends me half. $6.50 7 p.m. — Dinner today is a toast with olive oil and lentils stashed in the freezer that J.'s mom gave us. She always sends us home with a couple of things when we visit. I'm super grateful because it makes my life easier, and she's an amazing cook. 8 p.m. — We are traveling to Mexico City over Thanksgiving break but haven't booked a place to stay yet. After looking through a million Airbnbs, we settle on one that's cheap, cute, and still in the neighborhood we want to be in. Four nights come to a total of only $140.

Here. We. Go. 10:30 a.m. — I have a prep period, which means my students are with another teacher while I set things up for the rest of the day. I snack on almonds from home while I work. 11:40 a.m. — Lunchtime! Last night, I made lunch for the next two days, quinoa with black beans and steamed string beans. The quinoa is bland, but at least it's filling. 7 p.m. — J. and I decide to treat ourselves to dinner tonight. We decide on a Vietnamese/Thai restaurant that we love near our place. It's a family-style restaurant, so we split an order of chicken wings, a noodle soup, and a steak salad. J. offers to pay and I let him. We are insanely full by the end of our meal. Everything was excellent but a far stretch from our usual healthy weekday meals. We decide to walk a bit before going back home.

I make my matcha really strong today, get dressed, and leave for work. 11:40 a.m. — My lunch hour this year is so early that it feels more like a second breakfast. I eat another serving of the bland-AF quinoa with black beans and string beans, while my coworkers eat warm bagels from a nearby shop. I'm proud of myself for resisting the urge to spend. 4 p.m. — I'm home now and starving because lunch was so early. I make toast topped with olive oil and sea salt to hold me over until dinner. I need to pick up some supplies for work from the education store, so I make it a quick trip and grab Velcro dots, name tags, a plan book, borders, and charts. The DOE is giving teachers $250 to spend on supplies this year so the money I spent here will be expensed as part of that. ($52.25 expensed) 7:30 p.m. — For dinner, J. and I made bun-less burgers with sautéed mushrooms and onions. It's delicious and nutritious and I wish we had more. We also open a bottle of red wine, because it's Friday! I stick to one glass because I love wine, but my skin doesn't.

Good bread is my ultimate weakness. We make two fried eggs each, bacon, and use the bread for dipping. I slather strawberry jam onto another piece of the baguette while J. makes coffee; the smell is intoxicating. I resist, make my usual matcha, and note that my collagen powder is nearing its end. I add that to the list of things I need to buy but don't feel like spending money on yet. 10:30 a.m. — The weather is perfect this morning, so we walk to a nearby neighborhood for caffeine round two. I spend the next hour slowly sipping tea and reading the . $9.90 12 p.m. — J. has plans to meet up with friends in the afternoon and I decide to check out an event that's boasting free manicures from one of my favorite salons. I figured it's worth a shot and take the train two stops into Chinatown. By the time I get there, they've closed the list because too many people have shown up. I'm bummed until I see they're also giving out free, healthy lunch bowls. I snag a soba noodle bowl and a can of lemon seltzer, and stuck it in my bag for when I got hungry later. Now, it's time to go shopping. 1 p.m. — With the arrival of a new season coming up, my list of clothing ""needs"" is super long. At the top of it: black booties. Last year, I went through the season wearing a cheap and uncomfortable pair that I only sort of liked. I think I waited too long to buy them and there was nothing left. This year, I'm determined to find what I want — and early. I spend time online and at various stores with no luck. During a quick Instagram scroll, I finally stumble across a pair I'm into. I order them from inside a changing room at Oak + Fort. Perfect black leather, pointed-toe booties from Article&, see you in five-to-seven business days. $110 3:30 p.m. — I get hungry and walk to a nearby park to eat my soba noodle bowl outside. After I finish eating, I check out a few more stores nearby, eyeing some pieces I like but ultimately resist in favor of being able to pay my upcoming rent; sigh. Lastly, I stop at a pop-up shop to try on a pair of a company's recently-launched denim line. I love it and decided to order buy it with store credit I have from them from a previous return. 7 p.m. — After heading back to BK, I meet up with J. at a bar. I'm not in the mood to drink and just order sparkling water while he has a couple of beers. We go to dinner at a restaurant we've both been wanted to try for a while; everything is fresh, seasonal, and delicious. We split garlicky green beans with ricotta, squash angelotti, lobster fettuccini, and octopus. I pay half of the bill and we walk home after dinner. It's still early, so we watch the rest of and then go to sleep. $57.91 Daily Total: $177.81",6,115
"7:30 a.m. — I wake up feeling rested and refreshed. The fact that I've had a particularly low-key weekend has helped to boost my Sunday productivity levels. I make my matcha, lounge around in bed a bit longer, and head out to run errands. Laundry is up first. There is nothing I hate more than washing my laundry myself at the laundromat, especially on a crowded Sunday morning. I decide to drop it off; it will be ready later. 10 a.m. — Sundays always mean going to the farmers' market. J. and I usually get there as early as possible because the smallish one in my neighborhood gets swamped and sells out. For the upcoming week, we buy zucchini, pimientos de Padron, eggplant, scallions, honeynut squash, carrots, fresh eggs, ground beef, cranberry beans, herbs, potatoes, and apples. Everything comes to $59, which he and I split. We also stop at the supermarket for a box of sea salt. $40 11 a.m. — We still haven't eaten anything for breakfast yet (except for farmers' market samples) and at this point, I'm hungry. We grab a muffin and a cinnamon roll for breakfast from a bakery ($7). $3.50 4 p.m. — With no major plans for the day, we decide to prep our lunches for the week. J. and I enjoy cooking and experimenting with new ingredients, and I've found that having a good lunch at work really makes a big difference in my days. We make four lunches of meatballs with cranberry beans, roasted eggplant, and carrots, and east some for a late lunch/early dinner. 6:30 p.m. — When the laundry is ready ($26), we pick it up and stop for one last treat. We each get two scoops of ice cream from a shop directly across the street. The flavors are seasonal and delicious and I don't regret my decision one bit ($15). Overall, I am proud of my spending this week. I think that the end of summer and being back at work have made it easier to stick to a solid routine. I hoping this streak lasts, at least for a bit. $20.50 Daily Total: $64",7,115

Luckily, I meal-prepped work lunches last night at my boyfriend's place — chicken, brown rice, green beans, and a mixed-greens salad. I throw some yogurt, granola, and blueberries together for breakfast. 8:15 a.m. — Get settled in at work and catch up on my team's emails, as they're located on the East Coast and are six hours ahead. 9 a.m. — Eat the breakfast I brought from home. I'm not usually a breakfast-at-work person, but I've noticed recently that if I bring and eat something healthy in the morning, it keeps me from snacking in the afternoon. Guess people are right about breakfast being the most important meal of the day. 12:30 p.m. — Grab my lunch and go sit at the picnic tables outside to get some sunshine and enjoy the gorgeous weather. 4:30 p.m. — Head home, where I whip up lemons bars for a friend's birthday party later. I love to bake, so I always have the basics on hand and regularly pick up refills when I do big grocery runs. 7 p.m. — Bowling and pizza party for one of my girlfriends. I order a beer while we wait for lanes to open. $6 9:30 p.m. — After a few games of bowling and karaoke after, I head home. My friend's husband paid for pizza and bowling for everyone. I stay up to watch Hulu for a little bit before crashing early. Daily Total: $6",1,116
"6:30 a.m. — Alarm goes off but I hit snooze — that extra seven minutes of shut eye helps somehow. By 7:30, I'm up and have packed breakfast and lunch (the same as yesterday) before I head off to work. 8 a.m. — Arrive at work to an urgent assignment from my boss. After I hunt her down to get the guidance I need, I start to work on it. I eat breakfast about an hour later, and then finally come up for air around 12:45 when I decide to go outside again and enjoy the sunshine and my lunch. 3:15 p.m. — Take a mini-work break to order part of a birthday gift for my dad. He's obsessed with anything aged in a bourbon barrel. I find a hot sauce made like that, and it comes with a cookbook so he can make his own. $25.62 5:30 p.m. — After a lot of back and forth with my boss, I finish up the assignment and head home. 6 p.m. — Knowing I have a busy, fun-filled weekend ahead of me, I decide to stay in and watch all the trashy shows I can't watch with my BF. 7:30 p.m. — I make nachos for dinner and eat in bed.

Russian piping tips for frosting have been all over Instagram and calling my name for months ($35.06). Also, a 24-K gold face mask that has been in my Amazon ""save for later"" cart is having a lightening deal and is $10 off ($14.95). I take advantage of it. $50.01 2 p.m. — A friend texts me to ask if I want to hang out after work. She's dropping someone off at the airport at 4 p.m., and needs to kill time before meeting other friends later without fighting traffic to go home in between. Hawaii traffic is notoriously horrible, and I live close to the airport. 4 p.m. — I leave work but hit up the grocery store first. I usually go every two weeks and do a big stock up, but I forgot some stuff last time. I buy rice I needed, yeast (I've starting making my own bread recently), a nice big piece of salmon for lunches next week, and fruit. Since almost everything must be shipped to Hawaii, groceries are particularly expensive. $50.97 4:30 p.m. — I found a new and fun-looking speakeasy-style spot on Instagram. My friend is just as adventurous as me, so she stops by my place and we drink a glass of prosecco. (The bar doesn't open until 5.) 6:30 p.m. — That bar was super cool — I'm definitely coming back. I had a delightful gin cocktail and we split pupus. We leave so that she can go meet up with other friends. $23.82 8:30 p.m. — The same friend has wrangled our other friends to go out closer to my place, so I decide to join in. She swings back by my place and we finish the rest of the prosecco. 9 p.m. — Friends that live across the street hail a Lyft and we all head out. 11:30 p.m. — We head to a fun hotel lobby bar with live music.

Grab 20 more minutes of precious sleep. 7:20 a.m. — Get up and out the door real fast to meet my friends in the lobby. Luckily, we live in the same condo building! 7:30 a.m. — Hail a Lyft and head off to the beach. This morning, the Hokule'a is making her return home to Hawaii after spending the last three years circumnavigating the world using only traditional Polynesian navigation techniques. $10.42 10:30 a.m. — The homecoming ceremony was amazing. I'm filled with so much pride for the people of Hawaii and the crew of the Hokule'a and her sister ships. We're ravenous after, and decide to go to brunch on the beach in Waikiki. 2 p.m. — We finally leave brunch. The restaurant wasn't too busy, so we got to enjoy the company, the view, and the cheap lilikoi mimosas. $36.37 4 p.m. — Still slightly tipsy from brunch. I go back on Amazon and order an amazing, comfy t-shirt dress I recently purchased in two other colors. ($37.98) In my attempts to be less crappy to the environment, I also buy reusable produce bags ($8.97), so that I can stop wasting so much plastic when I shop. $46.95 6:30 p.m. — Meet up with same friends from the morning to go to a block party celebrating the ship's homecoming. (It's a big deal for the community.) I walk up to their condo to have a drink before heading out. 8 p.m. — We walk to block party in the neighborhood over, and are met with tons of food trucks and vendors. We buy dinner; I got a kalbi beef rib dinner plate. This block party is right near my boyfriend's place, but he's out of town. I message him (halfway across the world) to see if the door is unlocked so we can use the bathroom. It is, so we end up eating on his lanai, grabbing more drinks, and losing track of time. $14.52 12:30 a.m. — It's late and we've done some damage on the gin, so it's time to head home. I hail a Lyft. $10.20 Daily Total: $118.46",4,116

I eat a pickle, drink a glass of OJ, swallow an Advil, and head out the door. 12 p.m. — Hike a few miles on an old, abandoned highway that leads to a really cool lookout point above the new highway. I'm glad that my friend convinced me to get out of bed. This was so worth it. 1:45 p.m. — Having the Amazon app on my phone will be the downfall of my budget. I notice that my heels are in really bad shape (the one downside of wearing open-toed shoes year round), I buy an electronic foot file I've had my eye on for a few weeks. $31.29 2:30 p.m. — Since the weather is a little rainy and icky, we decide to treat ourselves to Japanese hot pot for an early dinner. I gorge on veggies, noodles, and short ribs cooked in a tom yum broth. So good! $30.24 4 p.m. — I'm home and watching TV. I plan on going to sleep early to make up for being out so late all weekend.

Nothing like getting into bed with freshly washed sheets. I don't have laundry in my unit, but it's on the same floor — which isn't too bad. I run two loads for $4.75 from a pre-loaded card. 7:30 p.m. — Scrounge around in the kitchen and end up making dinosaur chicken nuggets for dinner. Kid food is my guilty pleasure. 8 p.m. — Watch TV and go to asleep around 10. I think I'm still recovering from the weekend! I'm getting old. Daily Total: $0",6,116

We each order three bespoke cocktails, split an appetizer, and tip. $45 9:30 p.m. — Pop into the grocery store to pick up mixed greens for my lunch salads and asparagus for meal prep. Then head home to cook. $9.47 10:45 p.m. — Finally finishing cooking and cleaning up — the worst part and, honestly, what keeps me from cooking a large portion of the time. 11:30 p.m. — Showered and in bed.

I return home, feed both dogs, my roommate's two cats, and then myself. I make a poached egg and spread peanut butter on a rice cake. 8:45 a.m. — Shower and get dressed for work. In an effort to start saving more for a trip to Asia next year, I transfer $25 over to my savings account. $25 9:20 a.m. — My older sister asked me to see Ibeyi with her in November. I purchase tickets, which end up being just under $20 after taxes and fees. $20 9:40 a.m. — Walk the four blocks to my train stop and head to work. I pay for the ride with my unlimited week pass. On the train, I do some online shopping and stock up skincare for the fall: $63 to Glossier (includes $5 off for referring a friend) and $28 to Deciem. This is definitely a splurge, but I hope it will hold me over for a bit. $91 10:30 a.m. — Settle in at work and check my emails. I see that a few sweaters I have had my eye on are back in stock, and buy one in three different colors. (I get 25% off thanks to my employee discount.

I keep lunch supplies in our mini-receptionist fridge and replenish them every two or three days from home to eat better and spend less money on food. 7 p.m. — Out the door and on the way to the train. Back at home, I take the excited dogs out to meet a coworker-friend. He's nice enough to bring me a quesadilla from Taco Bell since I mentioned I haven't eaten dinner yet. I QuickPay him $4. We take the dogs on a long walk around the neighborhood. $4 8:45 p.m. — Back to my condo. It's dinnertime for all the pets, and beer time for me and my coworker-friend.

On the train, I realize that I haven't meditated today, so I pop my headphones on and do a 10-minute session. Once off the L, I just miss the bus, so I take an Uber from Eighth Avenue to the bar; there is no way I'm walking the remaining mile in heeled mules. I use a $5 credit from Uber from a previous fare dispute. $2.42 8 p.m. — A girl starts harassing me in the bathroom, and then again by the front of the bar while I wait for my date. You can tell a lot about a person by how bitter they are when they're drunk. My date gets the gift of seeing me in full-on offensive mode as I try to get the bouncers to help me out. (I feel like all my dates should see me like this so that they know what they're getting into.) To make up for the annoyance, the staff gives us a round of drinks — vodka soda and red wine — on the house. 9:30 p.m. — We move to a cute Italian restaurant nearby. We each have a glass of wine and a salad. I'm so full from my Indian food that I just order an arugula with avocado dressing, figs, and a few other mix-ins. My date treats, with a joke that I ""got the drinks."" 11 p.m. — Walk to my date's apartment for a glass of wine, rooftop skyline ogling, and some bow chicka wow wow. (Fourth date, y'all.) He offers to send me home in an Uber, which I gladly accept. 1:30 a.m. — I am feeling this wine! I drink a liter of seltzer from my SodaStream, wash my face with water, and coat my body with coconut oil. I take my daily Fem Dophilus probiotic (the best for preventing/curing yeast infections, UTIs, BV), which I buy in bulk on Amazon. After climbing into bed, I mess around on Instagram. It's a bad habit, but I need to ""read"" something in order to fall asleep, and I don't want to read my book when I'm tipsy. I pass out. Daily Total: $13.26",1,118
"7:30 a.m. — Drag myself out of bed to do yoga. I was certified as a vinyasa instructor two years ago and do a daily home practice. I meditate for 18 minutes and then do 30 minutes of yoga to classical music. My music varies from hip-hop, to classical, to nature sounds, depending on my mood. Over the past two years, I've found that regular yoga and meditation have freed me from the manic-depressive disorder I was diagnosed with in college. In addition to regular therapy for several years, it has even allowed me to get off all related prescription drugs. I consider my daily practice as vital as sleep. 9:20 a.m. — Eat apples from yesterday with hemp hearts (a.k.a., I bite the apple and dip it in hemp since there are no sharp knives in my office), and drink a cup of tea from the kitchen. I like to buy hemp hearts on Amazon at $13.49 for a 1.5-pound bag. I drink hot tea all day long because my office is FREEZING. 1 p.m. — Head to Whole Foods to buy arugula, avocados, and two cans of chickpeas. For lunch, I eat lentils from the previous week's Trader Joe's haul, with arugula and avocado for lunch. I am a creature of habit and my workday meals are basically the same every day. No, I don't get bored. $10.84 6 p.m. — Head to a show at the main venue for New York Fashion Week. I used to work in the industry and still manage to get RSVPs. Unfortunately, the free coffee bar is already closed when I get there, and I really wanted a lavender soy latte! Paris Hilton sits front row, and, surprise, she is still super popular. The crowd mobbing her for a photo is out of control. 7 p.m. — Meet my brother and his girlfriend at a NYFW party at a trendy Chinatown bar. Drinks and hors d'oeuvres are free, and there are also disposable cameras, which we use to take pics that we snag for later use. A boy I befriended on Bumble texted me earlier to hang out, so I make tentative plans for later. 9:30 p.m. — My brother's girlfriend wants to go to Takoyaki. I generally don't eat dairy, but after recently visiting Japan, I can't resist a matcha dessert! I order the soft serve matcha-black sesame swirl with red beans and mochi served in a fish waffle! $7 10 p.m. — UberPool it home since I'm a very far walk from the subway, and I did not get as much sleep as I would have liked last night. $9.04 10:15 p.m. — Back home. Brush my teeth, wash my face, apply diluted apple cider vinegar as a toner, and slather on coconut oil. By the time I take my daily dose of probiotic, I see that Bumble boy has taken over 90 minutes to text me back confirming our meet up. I ignore the message and go to sleep. I'd rather have energy to do yoga tomorrow than wait on fuckboys. Daily Total: $26.88",2,118
"7:45 a.m. — Press snooze and have to sacrifice morning meditation. I do my 30-minute yoga practice, shower, get dressed while listening to , and take the subway to work. 9:15 a.m. — Apples with hemp again. This combo probably looks pathetic but IDGAF — it's so yummy. Drink office herbal tea. 12:30 p.m. — There are candidates in the office for a lengthy interview process, and lunch is being provided. I grab salad, take half a grilled veggie wrap, and pick the cheese out of half a portobello wrap. I also snag the leftover salad for the my base of lunch greens for the rest of the week. 5:30 p.m. — Head to a NYFW show for an evening wear collection in Midtown, right near my office. I spy Jamie Foxx and Marlon Wayans in the front row. I leave the show early because the clothes look like prom dresses, and I have a second show right after. I take the subway to the Whitney. 6:05 p.m. — This show is a disorganized disaster. I have a priority RSVP and am told (along with 15 other people) to stand in line with the standing room crowd. Very annoying to go through the trouble of securing an RSVP, only to wait with people who don't have an invite. I manage to get an okay seat in the back and enjoy the energy of the collection. 7:30 p.m. — Eat the chana saag I made Sunday for dinner, and chocolate PB2 I order in bulk from Amazon with cinnamon from Costco. Later as a snack, I have some of the Lindt dark chocolate I buy at Lot Less — only $1/bar! 9 p.m. — My friend comes over to pregame. We drink vodka and Monsters that I have leftover in my fridge. (Never again. I'm a Red Bull girl.) Then we then take the subway to meet our friend in the Meatpacking District for a NYFW party. 11 p.m. — A bartender I know gives me a free drink (#networking?). I contribute $6 towards my group's tip for three drinks. $6 1:45 a.m. — I hate taking UberPool when it is late, but I had a month of flat-fee Ubers thanks to a special offer, and now my heart sinks when I see the true fare prices. I risk the Pool (it is Tuesday, at least), and luckily there is only one pickup, two cool-looking Russian guys. The drinks hit me and I sleep nearly whole ride back to Williamsburg. $11.54 2:15 a.m. — Take off my makeup with coconut oil and put myself to bed after drinking a liter of seltzer. I can't help reading through BuzzFeed a little before I fall asleep. Daily Total: $17.54",3,118
"7:45 a.m. — Wake up too late to fit in meditation. I do 30 minutes of a yoga flow, shower, listen to while I get dressed, and head to work on the subway. 9:30 a.m. — I eat two more of my apples from the weekend (sans hemp today) and drink a cup of chamomile tea from the office kitchen. 11:50 a.m. — Head to Trader Joe's for prepared lentils, baby carrots, cauliflower rice, coconut milk, and Medjool dates. I buy five bananas and two pints of blueberries from the fruit cart outside ($5). $27.12 1 p.m. — I combine the salad from yesterday with lentils and avocado. I also add in pasta salad from yesterday's office lunch, blissfully ignoring the dairy lurking in the pesto. 4:30 p.m. — Team bonding with my company! We walk to a boxing studio in Flatiron. I haven't boxed in ages, or really done any sort of intense activity due to an injury, and I'm pleasantly surprised at how well my hamstring has recovered. Class is super sweaty, and we get to leave work early! 6 p.m. — Why, Q train, ? I wait 20 minutes during rush hour for a Q to take me to the Upper East Side to meet my friend at the Met. Her train is also delayed, so we both arrive 20 minutes late. 6:50 p.m. — My friend is a member of the Met and invited me to a scavenger hunt in the Egyptian section! We listen to a talk about the Temple of Dendur, and there's an open bar with light snacks. I'm starving and help myself to handfuls of roasted peanuts. Our team wins a photo contest, thanks to my human pyramid idea (with one team member posing as a mummy). We receive erasers shaped like ""William,"" the Met's hippopotamus mascot — and bragging rights. 8:30 p.m. — We mingle with some of the other attendees and try to decide on a place for dinner. I'm not impressed with the vegan selections of the chosen restaurant, so I decide to head to the train and go home. 9 p.m. — I eat a southwestern veggie burger with avocado, cilantro, nutritional yeast, and salsa, courtesy of my fridge, and watch while I eat. For dessert, I eat a bunch of Noor dates ($16.10 for 3.5 pounds on Amazon!) and a nectarine. 11 p.m. — Wash my face, slather my skin with coconut oil, take my probiotic, and ditz around on my phone in bed until I fall asleep. I have unread e-books on my Kindle app (currently reading in French since it was free and I haven't read it before), but the siren song of BuzzFeed and Instagram lures me in. Daily Total: $27.12",4,118
"7:45 a.m. — Wake up too late to meditate again! I do 30 minutes of yoga, shower, and get dressed. In a pursuit to keep my conversation and listening skills up, I listen to France Inter radio. I take the subway to work. 9:20 a.m. — Breakfast is a sliced banana, half a pint of blueberries, chia, flax, and hemp hearts. I wash it all down with chamomile tea. 2:30 p.m. — Fix myself lentils, avocado, and salad for lunch, and snack on baby carrots and dates. Dates are my weakness. 5:45 p.m. — Take the subway to the UES for a Gucci beauty event at a townhouse. I get there at 6 but nothing is set up or ready, even though the event is slated for 6-8 p.m. A few people trickle in, looking awkward and confused as the staff explains that things won't start until 8. The whole production looks bootleg, so I bounce. 6:15 p.m. — Attempt to take the F to the Lower East Side, but because an entrance is closed, there is a literal mob on the platform. I make my way back to the N/Q and switch to a D train...with no air conditioning. 7 p.m. — I finally get to the LES where I'm meeting a friend for dinner at a vegan Mexican restaurant. We nix our plans for ceviche, and order a tower of delicious, gooey, cheesy nachos. I order a cucumber basil vodka drink and mushroom tacos. We share a banana caramel tart; delicious! $45.16 8:10 p.m. — We split an Uber to the East Village to meet another college friend for drinks. $5.35 8:20 p.m. — Quick stop at Duane Reade for a pack of gum to cover our Mexican food breath! $1.75 8:45 p.m. — We're disappointed to see the hot bartender we love to poke fun at is no longer at the bar. After another vodka soda, we realize that Hot Bartender got a haircut and was completely unrecognizable! $12 10:15 p.m. — I take the subway home, where I make some seltzer and do my usually wind down. I also see that the replacement vibrator I bought from Crave has arrived! I recently purchased a different one that stopped charging after only a few months. Luckily, this is covered under their warranty. Daily Total: $64.26",5,118
"7:45 a.m. — Ugh, up late again! This week has been awful for my meditation practice. I do 30 minutes of yoga, shower, get dressed listening to France Inter radio, and then take the subway to work. 9:20 a.m. — Breakfast of bananas, a half-pint of blueberries (I put the second pint in the freezer to keep over the weekend), chia, flax, and hemp mix. Drink a cup of green tea for a boost of energy. 12:30 p.m. — Grab my headphones and go to meditate in the park for 20 minutes. It is a beautiful day, and I roll my dress straps down to soak up the sun. 1:30 p.m. — Lunch of salad, avocado, lentils, and pasta salad. 3:45 p.m. — A ""little more"" pasta ends up being about a full serving, and I am now very full. 4:15 p.m. — I go on Amazon to order a sports bra and leggings; a friend is going to make me a custom outfit with vinyl details. She's made some cool pieces so far, and I'm dying to get a set made. I order multiple sizes and styles, and end up with four pairs of leggings and a longline bra. I will return two or three pairs after I try them on. $74.03 5 p.m. — Take the subway home, talk to my mom on the phone, and then head back into Manhattan to meet a friend. 7 p.m. — Meet my friend at his boyfriend's office in Times Square. In this area, the two-block walk from the train is like walking through Purgatory. 8:30 p.m. — We just miss the W and take the R into Queens. From there, I call an Uber to a beer garden in Astoria where we are celebrating our friend's birthday! $11.96 9:30 p.m. — I put a vodka soda and strudel for the birthday girl on my friend's tab. He says he will Venmo me later, but I tell myself to remind him later, since he never remembers to charge me. 10:45 p.m. — I walk to another bar in Astoria to meet a friend who just got off work. He knows the bartender here and orders me a vodka soda. I talk to a cute guy, but he's super shy, can't seem to make conversation, and eventually excuses himself. 12 a.m. — Ugh, why am I going into the city? We take get in an empty subway car back into Midtown (perfect for a group DIY ""Showtime!"" performance) and meet a friend in Hell's Kitchen. I've been drinking so frequently this week that I don't even want another drink. I dance with all the boys, and decide to bounce after they head to a bar more than 10 blocks away. My poor feet are not here for it! 2 a.m. — I take an Uber home, and commence the usual ritual — plus a liter of seltzer from the SodaStream. $28.07 Daily Total: $114.06",6,118
"11:30 a.m. — Crawl out of bed and meditate for 20 minutes, followed by 30 minutes of yoga. I hate that I don't have time for an hour today, even on Saturday! I don't think I'd last the day without sleeping in, though. 12:45 p.m. — Head to C-Town to buy oil-cured olives, canned organic tomatoes with basil (the best and cheapest sugar-free sub for pasta sauce), and an avocado. I am making a vegan Alfredo sauce for a birthday dinner that my brother's girlfriend is throwing. I also make edamame spaghetti. $10.48 3:45 p.m. — I take the subway into Manhattan to meet my parents. We have free passes to the Affordable Art Fair, where there is an amazing collection of works! My mom looks into purchasing a few pieces, but ultimately goes home without them to think it over. I realize that the definition of ""affordable"" here is subjective, and I stick to gawking. 5:30 p.m. — Head to a coffee shop with my parents to hang out. My mom gets me an iced tea, and I help eat her donut. After, I take the subway back to my apartment. 7 p.m. — Take the subway to Fort Greene, weighed down with sauce, pasta, olives, natural cider, and a few items (yogurt and tuna) I'm giving to my brother, since I no longer will be eating them. As I'm struggling with my huge bag, a girl cuts in front of me and stops short to call me a bitch for bumping into her. Stay classy, NYC. 7:40 p.m. — Carry the huge food bag up the third floor walk-up. There is a great turn out! We drink wine and the cider I brought, and there is more artisanal cheese than anyone knows what to do with. I snack on grapes and pecans instead. Sigh. Cheese. I need to find a solid vegan substitute ASAP. My brother's girlfriend serves linguine bolognese and the vegetarians eat my vegan Alfredo creation with edamame noodles. There is also a chocolate coffee cake with cream cheese frosting. I try to eat fig jam on crackers, but I succumb to a small slice, dairy be damned. I never miss meat, but I can't say no to dessert! 1 a.m. — My brother's friend has a Car2Go account, which he uses to drop me off on his way home. Woo-hoo! I also steal the leftover veggie pasta, since there is a ton of meat pasta left — not to mention cheese. 1:30 a.m. — I've been texting a boy throughout the night and we made plans to meet up in Williamsburg later on, but nothing materializes. He tells me he's too tired to stay out and is heading home. Sigh. I do my usual ritual and go to sleep. It's probably for the best, since I need to be awake by 9 a.m. tomorrow to get to the Rockaways. Daily Total: $10.48",7,118
"5 a.m. — Wake up and get ready for work. I'm always starving in the morning, but I hate breakfast foods. I eat some leftover dan dan mian from takeout a few nights ago. Manage to take the bus/Metro all the way to work, which is impressive for a Friday. I have a new-ish job, but I still have so much money on my SmarTrip card from my old employer that I don't pay attention to how much my commute costs. (Depending on the route I take, it's somewhere between $8 - $10/day, roundtrip, which seems expensive since my old commute used to cost $4/day, roundtrip. I still contribute to my SmarTrip, but sometimes I take an Uber or Lyft to the Metro.) I debate getting a coffee until I remember that I have a green juice at work provided by my employer provided (not typical). I try to drink coffee only once or twice a week anyway. Plus, I'm going on vacation in a few weeks, and then again in six months, and I'm saving for elective surgery. 8:45 a.m. — I'm waiting for my new iPhone to arrive, so I order a case, a screen protector, and glass screen cover. I try to only buy online from places that offer Ebates and free shipping. The site I order from also has 10% off and I get a free glass screen cover! $49.77 9:15 a.m. — Ugh, I'm hungry already. Usually, I don't get hungry until around 10. I eat plantain chips from my snack drawer and two fun-size candy bars that I got from a coworker. I keep a full snack drawer because TBH, I'm always hungry. But my supply is dwindling and I need to go grocery shopping this weekend. 12 p.m. — Finally lunch! I'm taking one of my coworkers to lunch for her birthday. I try to bring my lunch Monday through Thursday. We go to a BBQ truck, where I order a pulled pork sandwich (it comes with chips), and I add collard greens. I've been getting my vegetables from juice for the past two days, and I'm craving something healthy to counteract everything else. My friend gets a platter with ribs, wings, and fries. $25.45 2:15 p.m. — I need an evening bag for an upcoming event. The one I have is basic and gold, but I need a silver-ish one. I end up only being $11 away from free shipping, and since shipping is $6, I look for something else to buy. I know that's how retailers get you to increase your average order value, but I don't care. I could always use another purse, but don't want to spend that type of money. I add a hand chain for $12. Since I hadn't registered online (I've only bought from this retailer in store), I get $15 off a $50 purchase — and it doesn't charge for shipping when the price is reduced. The entire order is cheaper than the purse alone. $38.25 4 p.m. — Yay! Time to leave work. I love my job, but this week has been tough. I head to a nearby salon for my monthly Brazilian. I meant to schedule it for closer to my trip, but oh well. $72 5 p.m. — Head to a store that has my hard-to-find soap and chocolate. Buy that, plus toiletries, and wine. After that, I grab a cauliflower curry bowl from a fast-casual place I love ($10.10). They don't have an app, which is annoying, because I like earning points and free food. I almost never visit fast-casual places that don't offer that, but I don't go to this one often and it's nearby. I take the bus home to eat dinner and drink wine before my friend with benefits arrives. I haven't seen him in a while. It's a really great set-up because I'm not interested in dating, and neither is he, and we are truly good friends. I always have fun with him, plus he helps with things around the apartment. Win-win. I fall asleep around 10. $46.30 Daily Total: $231.77",1,119
"7 a.m. — Wake up and eat the leftovers from last night's dinner. I lounge around in bed, but getting ready on the weekend takes me hours because of my skincare and makeup routines, so I'll have to get out of bed sooner rather than later. I don't mind though. I love doing it. I'm going to a beer festival in Maryland, a free outdoor simulcast of , and a nighttime street art exhibit. 12 p.m. — Eat some leftovers from a Dominican restaurant I went to with a friend a few days ago. I love international cuisine, in case you couldn't already tell. 1 p.m. — Take a bus to Metro, then get an Uber to go visit my friend with benefits. We usually don't see each other twice a week, but he lives somewhat near the beer festival. We talk for a while and catch up because we didn't really talk last night. $4.92 4 p.m. — Take an Uber from his place to the festival. I walk around, and grab a beer and ice cream. I love ice cream and there aren't many good places in D.C. for it, so when I see some, I get it. There are fun and funky artisan vendors, but I'm not in the market for anything, though I do enjoy browsing. $17 7 p.m. — Take a bus to Metro so I can head to the baseball stadium to see . The Kennedy Center hosts an annual, free outdoor simulcast in September, and I try to take advantage. I do attend shows at the Center, but they are expensive, so I get tickets through discounted sites. I usually don't do more than two per year. The Kennedy Center is my favorite place in D.C. and I appreciate that they offer free daily performances of dance troupes, singers, etc. I buy a beer and totchos, since I'm hungry and the good eateries aren't open. The totchos are huge, which is good, but I get full fast and have to throw a good amount away. I hate wasting food. $20.50 8:30 p.m. — I buy another beer, finish it, and bounce. Operas are long, and I know the story, so I decide to head to the Metro and check out the art exhibits in a different neighborhood. I get there, and the city is lit. There are outdoor performances and art all around. I can't turn a corner without running into something. The vibe is awesome, and it was the perfect night for it. $10.50 11 p.m. — Hop on Metro and head home. There's a 30-minute wait for the bus, so I call an Uber. Go to bed as soon as I get home. $5.01 Daily Total: $57.93",2,119
"9 a.m. — Wake up and head to the neighborhood farmers' market. Since I don't have any food at home, I get a squash samosa from one of the vendors for breakfast. She's cash only, so I grab a water from a nearby store and get cash back. I can't decide what I want for produce, so I get my usual non-produce items: a green juice, salsa, and tamales. $30.69 12:30 p.m. — My friend and I were supposed to go to a festival today, but it's super-hot out and we decided not to. I wake up from my nap and eat one of the tamales, then work on blog posts and job applications. I have an MBA and I'm looking to switch industries. By the time I look up from my computer, it's after 4. I message my friend from earlier in the day to see if she wants to grab a drink at the new beer garden in the neighborhood. 5:30 p.m. — I walk to my friend's place and we walk to the beer garden. We both get a beer, but she doesn't like the food menu, so we head to a neighboring bar. $9.80 6:30 p.m. — Score! This bar has $2 drafts, half-off appetizers, and half-off burgers. I don't go for the draft special, but I do get a bottle of local beer, a chicken sandwich, and we split tots and nachos. It's way cheaper than the other place. We head home around 8, and I watch part of a documentary I've been getting through somewhat slowly this whole week. I'm asleep by 9. $16.48 Daily Total: $56.97",3,119
"5:25 a.m. — I was awake from 1:30 through 3:30 a.m., which isn't typical, and I have to wash my hair this morning. I won't be late, but I won't have time to take the bus. I do manage to throw a hair mask on while I shave and exfoliating in the shower, so I'm pleased about that. Call an Uber to take me to Metro. $4.64 6:45 a.m. — I'm tired, so I order a PSL from Starbucks. $5.89 7 a.m. — Get to work, drink my latte, and eat a tamale while I answer emails. By 10:30, I'm hungry. Our weekly team meeting starts shortly, and lately it has been 90 minutes instead of 60. I eat plantain chips and half of a pressed fruit bar from my snack stash. 12:15 p.m. — I heat up another tamale for lunch and drink the green juice I bought yesterday. Around 3, I grab two fun-size candy bars from coworker. Really wish the candy wasn't so close. 4:45 p.m. — Leave work and take Metro to the grocery store. I stock up on a seasonal flavor of instant oatmeal (six boxes) and travel packs of olives (10 pouches), plus an expensive beer and wine. I also buy chicken thighs, pork chops, tortilla chips, a veggie mix, cilantro, parsley, haricot vert, strawberries, dried mango (two pouches), and popcorn. The store is out of a few things I need, which means I'll have to go back later in the week. I was hoping to buy enough so I wouldn't need to grocery shop again before my trip. I try to keep in mind that I'll be getting dinner out tomorrow, and maybe again over the upcoming weekend, so I don't want to overbuy either. $88.85 5:30 p.m. — Uber home because I have three bags of groceries. $3.93 6 p.m. — Cook rice and black beans, chicken, pork, and my veggie mix with cauliflower rice I already had. The rice and beans are for breakfast and the pork and vegetables are lunch for the next two days. I snack on chips and salsa while I cook, and then have some chicken and black beans for dinner. A friend calls and asks to get drinks, but I'm tired and already settled in with a glass of wine (from Friday night's bottle) and my documentary. I decline and fall asleep sometime after 9.

"6:10 a.m. — I was up again in the middle of the night and wake up super late. I make a note to use my Yoga Nidra app tonight. Also, I haven't worked out since last week, so that's probably not helping. I'm out of ClassPass classes, so I will have to use the gym at work because it's too hot to be outside. I walk a lot, but am heat sensitive; if it's above 75, I can't work out outside, which is my preference. I move quickly and am in an Uber by 6:35. $6.05 7:25 a.m. — Arrive at work. I packed breakfast, lunch, and snacks. I eat some black beans and rice, but am still hungry, so I have the rest of the pressed fruit bar. 11:45 a.m. — Eat my lunch of the pork chop, veggies, plus some strawberries and olives. I'm meeting a friend for happy hour at 5:30, but don't want to be starving when I get there, so at 3:30 I eat an applesauce cup from my snack stash. 4 p.m. — Leave work and Metro to the mall to meet my friend. We do happy hour at an Indian restaurant and share samosas and naan pizza, plus get two drinks each. Our samosa order was placed incorrectly, so we get free ones to take home. $26.36 6:30 p.m. — We're meeting at the mall because I need to do some shopping for my upcoming trip, and she works nearby. She heads home, and I shop, but don't find much. I do get a shirt, some socks, and a water ($1.50). I hate shopping at the mall. $24.50 7:30 p.m. — Head to Metro and check five different bus routes. It doesn't seem like any of them will work without me having to wait 40 minutes. I thought I'd need to take an Uber, but when I get off the Metro, a bus is running late, so it works perfectly. Get home and see that I got a speeding ticket in the mail. I'm usually super careful, and I haven't gotten a speeding ticket in 15 years. I'm so mad. D.C. has cameras everywhere, so I drive really slowly through the city, but I clearly was not paying attention that day. I fall asleep at 9. $100 Daily Total: $156.91",5,119
"5 a.m. — Sleep through the night and wake up just before 5. This is great because I'm staying with my best friend, who is having minor outpatient surgery today; now I'll have time to pack some clothes and cook food for my stay and for my remaining weekday lunches. I really don't want to spend money on takeout or delivery while I'm staying with her. I eat the leftover samosas for breakfast, and manage to have enough time to take the bus. I'm still tired though. I have a busy day at work, and it's double-stars day, so I order a PSL. $5.89 10 a.m. — Since I ate my samosas around 5:30, I'm starving. I eat olives and plantain chips, and then by 11:45, eat my lunch of pork, veggies, and strawberries. 4:30 p.m. — Leave work. I realized earlier that I didn't make enough food for the next two days of breakfasts, lunches, and dinners. I'll have enough for both breakfasts, but only one more lunch and one dinner. I guess that's what I get for cooking at 5 a.m. My friend isn't going to be out of surgery for a while, so I go to a make-your-own-pizza place and eat there. It has a rewards app, so I'm happy about that. $10.46 5:30 p.m. — Get to my best friend's place just as she does. She's doing well. I help her with things around the house and her one-year-old Morkie, which is basically my dog too. (We went through so much to get him.) She lets me do laundry, which means I won't have to pay to use the communal washers and dryers in my building, or add money to my laundry card, which is running low. I get an email from one of my blogs asking if I can attend a tasting next week. I went to two last week, which was great, because that means free drinks and free food, so I can socialize without paying. It's a new place I've been really wanting to try, too. My friend and I watch reality TV and eat pumpkin spice caramel popcorn (because we're basic) until heading to bed at 10. Daily Total: $16.35",6,119
"6 a.m. — It's so nice staying near the Metro. I wake up, shower, care for the dog, and am out the door by 6:30. Get to work at 7 and eat my rice and beans for breakfast. I'm still feeling slightly hungry, so after a while, I eat a handful of olives, too. I come across a receipt for parking. I don't drive to work often even though parking is cheaper than Metro for me; there's gas and wear and tear to consider as well. We have a parking spending account, where we can put in pre-tax money, and get reimbursed for parking. I don't have much taken out from my paycheck for this, but since I do drive sometimes, I figure it's worth it. This is from a month ago, but I submit it anyway to get my $7. I'm hungry around 10:30, so I eat some roasted chickpeas I forgot I had to tide me over until lunch. 12 p.m. — My office building has a farmers' market every Thursday, and sometimes food vendors come, too. My friend and I walk over, and a Jamaican vendor is there today, so I get a beef patty, then eat my pork and veggies a little later. $3 4:30 p.m. — Head to my friend's house. She's doing really well and we proceed to have a repeat of last night, which is fun. We both wish she could drink though, as wine would be great. We eat grilled cheese sandwiches for dinner. I love just relaxing with her and the dog. Tonight is my last night at her place, but we might go to an East African retail pop-up on Saturday if she feels up to it. I pass out at 10.

"9:30 a.m. — I'm a little late getting into the office, but it doesn't matter because it's Friday, and everyone is working from home anyway. I make myself a cup of coffee and eat a yogurt I brought from home while I catch up on email and prep for a meeting with my manager. 11 a.m. — My manager asks if we can reschedule for Monday. It's my first week on the job, and I still need to meet with him to discuss my role and responsibilities, since I have no idea what I'm supposed to be doing. He just returned from vacation, so this week has been crazy for him (and incredibly boring for me). I let him know Monday is fine and go back to browsing Nordstrom's sale section. I find a pair of shoes I passed on a few months back; they're now marked down 60%! $48.07 12 p.m. — I grab lunch with a friend at the café on our company's campus. I moved back to L.A. for this job, and it's been three years since we've seen each other. (I am terrible at keeping in touch.) I enjoy a watermelon feta salad while she fills me in on her marriage, her dog, and her career. I tell her about my long-distance relationship and how the new job is going. $8.69 1:30 p.m. — A coworker walks me through an ongoing project I'll be taking over. Yes, finally some work! 3:30 p.m. — So. Bored. I am craving something sweet, but I'm on a no-candy pact with my mom, and I can't let her down! I drink a LaCroix (Pamplemousse) from our kitchen, but it's only marginally satisfying. 5 p.m. — Hallelujah, freedom! I head home and meet up with my sister. My mom calls to let us know she has to stay at work late, so we should eat without her. We drive to our favorite dumpling restaurant. There's a small moment of panic when we first walk in and remember that it's cash only, but luckily we manage to scrounge up $15 from the depths of our purses. While eating, we discuss where we want to go for our Sister Trip later this summer. I promised her that if I got this new job, I'd take her on a trip, and now it's time to pony up! She wants to go to Japan to visit family but I don't think I can take the time off, since I've just started my job. $10 8 p.m. — After dinner, my sister and I pick up an order of our mom's favorite noodles to drop off at her job (my sister pays). Just as we're about to leave, Mom calls to let us know she's done with work and asks us to pick her up because she doesn't want to take the train this late at night. We agree and tell her about the noodles; she's thrilled! 10 p.m. — I forgot that I promised to catch up with friends tonight, and they call me to see where I'm at. I am home in my PJs and am totally exhausted, but this meet up is a bon voyage for my good friend M., who is moving to NY, so I muster up the willpower to get dressed. 11 p.m. — My friends are so fun! I grab a soda while we catch up and make up crazy stories about M.'s upcoming new life on the East Coast. We also talk about a group trip I'm planning: I am renting a house in Joshua Tree a few weekends from now, and we are trying to figure out who is available to come. I want to get at least six people to split the cost of the house (it will end up being $30 per person if we do so), but I'm concerned that no one in my laid-back friend group has fully committed yet. Everyone says they are down (except M., because he's moving), and I ask one of my friends to invite our mutual friend, B., whom I haven't asked yet. I split the bill evenly with my friends (most of whom had alcohol), so I overpay a little after tip is included. $7 1 a.m. — After getting home, I FaceTime with my boyfriend for an hour and futz around before bed. I'm moving out of my old apartment in San Diego this weekend and am feeling anxious about the move, my new job, no one coming on my trip, living at home, and a million other things. I have a hard time falling asleep. Daily Total: $73.76",1,120
"10 a.m. — I wake up feeling somewhat refreshed after sleeping in. Mom and I hit the gym since we skipped yesterday. She is supposed to cycle for 30 minutes a day as part of physical therapy for her knee; I go for moral support and do a HIIT workout on the elliptical near her. 11 a.m. — We finish our workout and are super hungry, so we grab brunch nearby. I get an iced coffee and an omelet with hash browns and ham, she gets a 2 x 2 x 2 platter. We talk about my move and my new job. I pay for our meal; it's pretty cheap, and I can afford to treat my mom! $27.54 1 p.m. — At home, I scrounge around for boxes to take to my apartment later tonight. My parents also happen to be moving soon. They bought a new house and will be moving at the end of the month, so our house is currently a chaotic whirlwind of STUFF; it stresses me out. I list some of my apartment furniture on Facebook and hope it sells. I make everything super cheap, which frustrates me because I paid way more, and it's all still in great condition, but I can't bring it with me. Out it goes. 5 p.m. — I drive back to San Diego to pack up what's left of my apartment. A few people contact me from Facebook, and I end up selling three out of five pieces! In total, I make a cool $480 for the night. Not bad. 7 p.m. — I'm starving so I walk over to my favorite fancy taco place. I start feeling sad and nostalgic about leaving San Diego and order way too much food as a result. When I bring the takeout bag home, I see that they've packed four forks with my order for one. $32.29 10 p.m. — I've already cut the internet at my apartment, so I'm bored to death. I lay in bed willing myself to go to sleep when I get a message from my friend, B. He tells me he's down for Joshua Tree and then brings up a fight we had a three years ago at a friend's birthday party. B. apologizes and tells me he's felt super guilty ever since then. I have also felt massively guilty about this fight, and his bringing it up is a relief. We both apologize and agree to have no hard feelings. I am really, really touched and feel a huge weight lifted off my chest. I've learned a lesson about emotional maturity and forgiveness. It's my last night in this apartment, and I sleep like a baby.

"8 a.m. — I wake up bright and early to meet my dad, who's driven his truck down from L.A. to help me move my mattress and bed. I haven't managed to sell my desk or dining table, but we find a way to squeeze it into the truck. He has plans later in the day, so he zips back up to LA while I eat leftover tacos for breakfast and do a final clean of the now empty apartment. 10 a.m. — My landlord arrives for my final walkthrough. He agrees to give me my full deposit back, minus a mandatory $75 carpet cleaning fee! I loved this apartment and would have stayed if I hadn't gotten a new job. I'll be transferring my rent amount to my parents going forward, so I'm not exactly saving money, but it's cheaper than finding a place of my own in L.A. 12 p.m. — I drive back to L.A., feeling way less anxious now that I've settled the apartment business. On the way back, my sister calls to asks if I want to go to Disneyland; we both have annual passes. I pick her up and we almost get all the way to Anaheim when I realize I've left my pass in my other purse. Moving has made such a mess of me! My sister doesn't want to go by herself, so we turn back towards home. I've wasted 40 minutes of our time, and I can tell she's annoyed but I'll make it up to her later. 1 p.m. — Dad borrows my car to take my grandparents out; it's lower and easier for them to get in and out of compared to his truck. I knock out for an hours long nap; moving this morning completely exhausted me. 4 p.m. — Grocery shopping for the week with Mom. I pick up rolled oats, almond milk, Greek yogurt, arugula, cherry tomatoes, cheese, hummus, bell peppers, sliced almonds, and a few other staples for the week. We split the bill. $30 7 p.m. — I prep food for the week and pick out work outfits before bed. Dad comes home and tells me he filled the gas tank on my car! I hope this second work week goes better, and I have more to do. Daily Total: $30",3,120
"6 a.m. — I wake up early so I can get to work early; I'm feeling anxious about this new job. Also, I have a few personal projects to sort through and hope I can use some quiet time in the office to get it all done. 8 a.m. — I am on a roll! I was so tired this morning that I forgot my breakfast and lunch at home, so I power through on coffee alone. This is probably terrible for me. 10 a.m. — My manager cancels our morning meeting. Again! I literally have nothing to do, so I spend the entire morning planning the group Joshua Tree trip (I make a Facebook event and four people RSVP); my upcoming Sister Trip (I decide we should go to Austin and book flights using credit card reward points); and a joint birthday/anniversary trip for me and my boyfriend in October. I call and reserve a kayaking session near a sea otter reserve. It's $95 per person, and part of the proceeds go toward protecting the oceans. $190 12 p.m. — I forgot that I actually made lunch plans to catch up with another coworker/friend! We meet at Starbucks, and I reload my app with $15 to cover the cost of a chicken wrap protein box (my fave) and an iced coffee, plus a little extra for later. I feel reenergized after talking with her. She is totally killing it at her job, and I'm so proud. I head back to my desk and hope I've gotten a few emails with work to do. $15 2 p.m. — Finally meet with my manager! I show him the data model I've been working on. I think he's impressed, but I don't know him that well, and he's hard to read. He turns the tables on me and asks me to review an email he's going to send to our VP. I try to make smart suggestions and sound confident. I am very new to being at the manager-level and feel a lot of pressure to perform! I still have a job at the end of our meeting, so I guess I'm doing okay. 5 p.m. — Time to go home. I love that my new team has great work-life balance. My last job included lots of unpaid overtime. 7 p.m. — Mom and I head to the gym again and do the same routine, her cycling and me on the elliptical. Our favorite Taiwanese noodle shop is right around the corner from the gym, and we can't resist stopping by for dinner when we see there's no line! I treat her. $35 10 p.m. — I halfheartedly start unpacking a few boxes before crawling into bed. My period started earlier today, and I'm exhausted and cramping. I switched to an IUD a few months ago and LOVE it, but am still adjusting, and having my period surprise me like this makes me feel like a teenager again. I FaceTime my boyfriend and read a little in bed before falling asleep. Daily Total: $240",4,120
"7 a.m. — Ack! I've somehow overslept despite going to bed pretty early last night. I rush to get ready and grab a yogurt to eat at my desk. 10 a.m. — I forgot that I made coffee plans with coworker! She messages me to confirm, and we agree to meet at the company cafe in 10 minutes, so I skip eating my yogurt. I was an intern for another team at our company a few years ago, so I have a lot of old coworkers and friends to catch up with now that I'm back. Networking and relationships are super important in my industry and within the company, so I don't feel bad about spending time reconnecting. I'm also hoping to glean some inside information from her that I can use in my new role. 11 a.m. — Catching up with my friend was great! She gave me some useful hints about changes to a few upcoming products that I can pass along to my team. We also had a serious career talk and brainstormed a few people for her to reach out to for future job opportunities; her contract with our company is almost up, and she is looking for something full-time. As someone who has been through that hustle, I sympathize. At least she still has another year on her parents' health insurance! Adulting is no joke. I promise to help review any cover letters or emails she sends my way and to tip her off if I hear about any openings. I pay for our breakfast sandwiches and coffee. $12.82 11:30 a.m. — I have THREE project requests when I get back from coffee! I've already done the work for one of them, so I send it over right away and the partner replies thanking me for my quick turnaround; they also Cc'd my manager! The other two projects need input from my manager, so I review the requests and put together a quick outline for how to address each one to pitch to him later. 12 p.m. — Some team members stop by to see if I want to get lunch. I am still stuffed from breakfast, but don't want to miss out on team bonding, so I agree. I get a lemonade to drink while they eat. We talk about upcoming summer plans, trends we've seen in our industry, and gossip about other teams. I try hard not be awkward, and I think I'm successful. I hope we can be friends! $2.52 2 p.m. — I drink a cup of coffee and a LaCroix to keep me going through the afternoon while I sit in on a meeting my coworker invited me to join. I'm still getting background on the team, and this helps me to learn a lot and get to meet some of our key partners. I worked on a similar project before and even manage to contribute to the session as well. 5 p.m. — Wow, it's already time to go. Now that I have actual work on my plate, the day flies by! I'm glad; I enjoy the work I do and am excited about the new opportunities this job gives me. I'm hungry from skipping lunch, and I scarf down a bag of chips in the car, which I regret almost immediately. 7 p.m. — My mom and I are both exhausted, and it's raining, which is basically apocalyptic in L.A. We decide to pass on the gym today. I eat leftover noodles and another mango for dinner. I promise myself to pack the rest of the noodles for lunch tomorrow. I normally don't eat out that often during the week, but this week has been exceptional since I just moved back and have a lot of people to reconnect with. 10 p.m. — I FaceTime my boyfriend and tell him about the sea otter kayaking trip I booked; he's excited. We confirm his flight information for this weekend, and he tells me he's booked dinner reservations for us, too! He is so sweet. He's in San Francisco, and I haven't seen him in a few weeks, so I'm glad he is flying down for my birthday this weekend. I remember that I need to order his birthday gift as well. I search online and buy us matching pairs of Tevas; I have been trying to convert him for months; now's my chance! I have a coupon code for 30% off, and the style I want is already on sale. I also add a couple of random tops to my cart to reach the free shipping threshold. I will most likely return most of these things once they arrive. $126.66 12 a.m. — I clean up, unpack a little, and read in bed before falling asleep. Daily Total: $142",5,120
"8 a.m. — At work early again. I eat the yogurt I abandoned yesterday, drink a cup of coffee, and plan my day. 11 a.m. — My manager asks me to help him with a special project he's working on for our VP. He is still slammed with work and hasn't had time to get started on this. I am thrilled. I think this means he trusts me? I agree to get a rough outline together by this afternoon for us to review. 12 p.m. — I go to a lunchtime yoga class with two of my teammates. We're super lucky to have a complimentary corporate gym, but classes are $8 each. I don't want to sweat too much, so I don't push myself too hard. Afterwards, I eat lunch at my desk (leftover noodles); it's a bit of a relief to not have a social lunch and be able to chill out — and save money. $8 3 p.m. — I have a networking phone call with someone from my university. He's working on a pro-bono consulting project and is interviewing me as an “expert” in my field. I feel extremely flattered — and under-qualified — for this. 4 p.m. — Touch base with my manager, and he approves my outline. We make a few tweaks to our plan, and I have clearance to move full steam ahead to finish this tomorrow. This is my first “big” project and I don't want to blow it! 7 p.m. — Gym time with Mom. She hasn't worked out in a long time, so I am proud of her for going to the gym consistently these past two weeks and taking control of her health. I make cauliflower rice bowls for the entire family for dinner (using the groceries I bought this past weekend and stuff already in the fridge) and pack the leftovers for lunch. 10 p.m. — I call a friend to catch up, FaceTime my boyfriend, and follow-up on Joshua Tree trip details before hopping into bed. I log onto Amazon to buy a Bluetooth adapter for my car so I can play music from my iPhone during the three-hour drive to the desert. (My car is so old it doesn't even have an aux connection.) I'm trying to develop a consistent earlier bedtime so I can wake up earlier, but it hasn't been going very well. I need to be more disciplined. $18.99 Daily Total: $26.99",6,120
"8 a.m. — I get to work early to wrap up the project for my boss. I pack a mason jar of overnight oats for breakfast, but decide I don't want to eat them after all, so I pop them into the work fridge for tomorrow and just have a cup of coffee. 11 a.m. — We head out for a team lunch at a local sandwich place I love. The sandwiches here are huge, and I know I should save half of mine for later. I still try to eat it all in one sitting and end up being way too stuffed. Oof. $12.57 12 p.m. — I read a article that recommends sticking a Bluetooth tracker in your luggage in case in gets lost, and my mind is blown. So genius! I immediately buy a pack of four trackers on Amazon ($70) and call them a birthday gift to myself. They're pricey, but I fly every other weekend to see my SO and am always paranoid that my luggage will get lost. I'll split the pack with him and my sister! 3 p.m. — My manager is too busy to review my project. I have a few other things to work on, but I am burned out. I have an afternoon coffee break and make myself a latte in the office kitchen. 7 p.m. — I get back from work and hit the gym with Mom. She asks me about the Amazon purchase (we share our Prime account), and she tells me she'll pay for the Bluetooth trackers as my birthday present! 10 p.m. — I take my time getting ready for bed and FaceTime-ing with my boyfriend. He is flying into L.A. tomorrow for my birthday! I have a moment of disbelief over the fact that I will be 26 in just a few hours. Time flies by. Daily Total: $12.57",7,120
"7:30 a.m. — Alarm goes off for the second time, an hour earlier than I need to be up. My boyfriend works farther downtown and needs more time to get there. Out of solidarity, I get up and commute with him in the mornings. We've only been dating for five months, so I'm chalking  up this extra effort to the being in the new relationship honeymoon phase. One benefit is that I'm not late for work anymore! 8:45 a.m. — Still a few minutes to kill before I have to head into work, so I stop at Starbucks and get a tall sugar-free vanilla iced coffee and do a quick walk around Bryant Park before going to the office. $3 9 a.m. — One enormous benefit of my job is that breakfast and lunch are provide. Since I am not a morning person or a very good cook, this has been an awesome perk. The downside is that I've already gained five pounds since I started working here six months ago; I'm trying to be better about snacking and piling on the meals. Start the day with a bowl of Raisin Bran. 12:30 p.m. — Time for lunch (and feeling proud I made it through the morning without unnecessary snacking). Make my usual salad with tuna, carrots, broccoli, and olives, and snag a bowl of seafood paella from the hot food station. I consider the risk of eating mussels from a corporate cafeteria ... but it smells (and tastes!) delicious. End lunch with a packet of mini-M&Ms and dark chocolate. Free snacks are tempting! 3 p.m. — Getting the 3 p.m. slump, so I take a quick break and walk around Bryant Park. Not a fan of this office location as I have to walk through Times Square to get anywhere. Overall; it's a small thing to complain about. I love the work, the people, and the hours. Sigh. So much for ""fresh air,"" although I do feel better after moving around. 4:45 p.m. — Heading out of work early to get a manicure before I meet my boyfriend for date night. I used to work much longer hours, and I'm enjoying the flexibility of leaving at a normal time. Still, I feel guilty heading out before 5 and slink to the elevator bank, hopefully unnoticed. 5:30 p.m. — Time for my first (and only) manicure of 2017. I have a horrible nail biting habit but have managed to grow my nails out enough to warrant treating myself. The salon is completely empty and the manicurist finishes in 20 minutes. I kill time drying my nails for longer than necessary because I'm not meeting the BF until 7. Not something I would want to spend my time on every week, but my nails do look good. $14 7 p.m. — Meet up with the BF outside of his office, and then take a nice walk through the Village. The weather is finally nice and the sun is out. We're attempting to get $20 tickets to see as part of a Broadway promotion I saw online. We take bets: I think we won't get them, he thinks we will. Fingers crossed! Since the show starts at 8 p.m. we don't have time for dinner beforehand; he buys a granola bar, and I snack on trail mix I took from work while we walk to the train. 7:45 p.m. — We got in! Great seats, and BF pays, since he still owes me $70 from a trip we took earlier this month. Apparently he's on an installment plan... $20 10:30 p.m. — The show was hilarious! So happy we got to see it, and psyched we got the discount. We walk around Midtown and settle on a Japanese dive bar that serves katsudon. I order a rice bowl with salmon and crab, and we split sake. We split the bill and head back to Astoria to stay at my BF's place. Shockingly, the trains run smoothly, but it's a very late night. I'm dreading tomorrow's alarm. $21 Daily Total: $58",1,121
"7:30 a.m. — Arghhh. I begrudgingly get up, shower, and get out the door at 8. 8:45 a.m. — Falling into the Starbucks trap: sugar-free vanilla iced coffee. I justify it with my lack of spending on other meals (even though I know these coffees add up). $3 9:15 a.m. — Feeling especially crummy today. I've been fighting a sinus infection or some other ailment for the last month, and I think it's time to go to the doctor. I have my own health insurance since I freelance, but the plan is terrible and nothing is covered — my excuse for letting things go this long. I book an appointment for tomorrow morning and grab a bowl of cereal and orange juice from the office kitchen. Maybe some vitamin C will cure me? 12:30 p.m. — Time for lunch. I get my usual salad from the office cafeteria and a cup of green tea. Hoping this is the magical elixir that will save me from tomorrow's doctor's appointment and the heavy price tag. 2:30 p.m. — Take my afternoon walk and stop by Duane Reade to pick up a generic sinus medication ($4.50). I also buy a coconut water ($2) since I think I might also be dehydrated and can't stand the taste of Gatorade. I take a sip of the coconut water and decide that Gatorade would have been preferable. Yuck! $6.50 3:30 p.m. — Head to our weekly staff meeting, where my boss tells me I look like I've been punched in the face. He sends me home for the rest of the day. I feel too sickly to be offended. I go home and crawl straight into bed. 7 p.m. — My refrigerator is empty, save for a bag of carrots and salsa. I used to be much better about cooking, but now that I no longer have to worry about breakfast and lunch, I've fallen into the bad habit of buying dinner multiple times a week and scrounging for unsatisfying meals the rest of the time. I need to be better about this, but for now, carrots will do. My head is pounding, so I snack a little bit and and then hit the sack by 8:30. Daily Total: $9.50",2,121
"8 a.m. — I wake up and can barely swallow, and my eyes are practically sealed shut. Obviously time to visit the doctor. I shoot my boss an email telling her I'll be working from home after I get back from my doctor's appointment. She works from home on Fridays, too, so my work guilt is at a minimum. 8:30 a.m. — The doctor doesn't open until 9 a.m., so I make a smoothie with frozen berries and the rest of the coconut water from yesterday. Hoping the fruit disguises the taste. The smoothie isn't bad and soothes my throat. I also make coffee and decide against showering. Fully embracing this sick day. 10 a.m. — I have strep throat! Semi-relieved to finally know what's been wrong with me for the past few weeks. This office doesn't take my insurance, but it's the closest to my apartment. The visit costs $125, and I wasn't charged anything extra, which is a relief. Because my insurance is so terrible, I was convinced the appointment would be $500, so I feel like I saved money. Mind over matter. $125 11 a.m. — Wait over an hour for my prescription to get filled ($4.80), and grab a bag of cough drops that are on sale to see if they'll help my sore throat. I'm bummed about the turn of events for this weekend, and I call my mom to tell her I can't meet my family for dinner or the concert tonight. Looks like my busy weekend is going to turn into something much more low-key, but obviously I need to start listening to my body a little better. Back home to bed I go. $6.50 1:30 p.m. — I work from home for about an hour, finishing up a project I need to send over to my boss. Once that's done, my boss tells me to get some rest. BF calls to see how I'm feeling, and we talk for a few minutes. It's gorgeous out and I could use the fresh air, but I burrow into my covers and try to get some sleep. 3 p.m. — So much for sleep. I'm already bored and antsy. Time for some self-soothing Amazon shopping. I impulse-buy a pair of black joggers I've been eyeing, two tubes of whitening toothpaste since I'm running low, and buy refrigerator poetry magnets as a gift for my boyfriend; he's mentioned wanting a set for his place. We'll be celebrating our six-month anniversary next month. Do couples give each other gifts for that?? If not, I'll put it aside for the holidays. The total comes to $35, but I have $34 in rewards points on my credit card. Since I don't really ""need"" any of these things, I use my points and the total comes to 84 cents! What a deal. $0.84 5 p.m. — Scrounge together another pathetic dinner of jarred cabbage and scrambled eggs. Make a mental note to recipe hunt and start making some real food. I need to start treating my body better, as is evidenced by my current health. 9 p.m. — Head to bed feeling sufficiently bummed that I'm missing family night, but my throat is painfully sore and my head is pounding. Fingers crossed a long night's sleep will restore me and the antibiotics will eventually kick in. Daily Total: $137.14",3,121
"11 a.m. — Rise and shine after 14 hours of sleep! Throat feels worse than yesterday, so I gargle with salt water, make a pot of coffee, and another smoothie with my frozen fruit and yogurt. Hydrating! My mom calls to see how I'm feeling, and we chat for a few minutes about the concert last night. As soon as I hang up with her, my sister calls. Lots of family catch-up time. 2 p.m. — Attempt to feel more human before I meet up with the BF. I feel better after a shower, and decide to walk the 50 or so blocks to his parents' apartment. I stop for more cough drops because the menthol ones I bought yesterday are too strong, and I can't stand the flavor. Trying cherry this time. $2 5 p.m. — Spend an hour helping the BF self-address envelopes for co-op applications. Even though he's explained the process to me many times, it still sounds overly confusing. All I know is that if he successfully applies, he'll own an apartment in NYC for much, much less than if he buys it outright. He makes an offhand comment about us living there together someday; I don't know if it's just because I'm sick, but it throws me for an overwhelming loop. I laugh it off and make a mental note to bring this up when we're not sitting in his living room with his parents and sister. 6:30 p.m. — BF and I take his family dogs around Central Park for a walk. The fresh air feels good, but I'm especially quiet after the housing talk before. I love him, but we've been together for five months! It seems speedy, and I'm feeling caught off-guard. I make the mistake of bringing it up when we have a few blocks to go, which leads to an awkward conversation about ""our future."" It's nice to hear he's so sure about this relationship and where it's going. I'm a much more tentative person and just don't feel ready to think about living together and planning a future. It's not exactly the way I saw this night going, and I suddenly regret leaving my bed! 8:30 p.m. — After tabling our big talk until we can be alone, we go to a Puerto Rican family restaurant in the neighborhood. His sister joins, and I order chicken mofongo, which tastes amazing. Considering this is the first real meal I've eaten in two days, it's salty and so delicious. Steal a few bites of the BF's steak, and his sister offers her chicharrones around the table. Leave the restaurant stuffed, and BF pays for dinner since it's cash only. I'll get the next thing. 11:30 p.m. — Finally back in Queens after lots of subway delays. BF and I hang in his room and continue our (long) convo about where we are. He admits he's been feeling pressure from his family, and apologizes for rushing things along. We agree that the pace we're at is good for us, and the co-op discussion will get tabled for much farther down the line. Whew! This is my first real relationship, and I'm feeling emotionally exhausted from this talk. We watch Netflix but I fall asleep 10 minutes in. Daily Total: $2",4,121
"10 a.m. — Sleep in 'til 10. I love Sundays when we're not rushing around for work! We laze around chatting for a half-hour and decide to get brunch in Astoria. It's my turn to pick the place, so I search Google Maps for a spot I've passed on my walk to the subway. We can't find it and decide to just walk around and pick something. 11:30 a.m. — We find the spot, and the brunch deal is great! It costs $14 for brunch with coffee and a drink; we're definitely not in Manhattan. We both order the same thing: omelets with cheddar and onions and arugula salad. BF orders a Bloody Mary, and I watch jealously as he drinks it. Since I'm on antibiotics, I stick to an iced cold brew which does wonders for my throat. We have the back patio completely to ourselves and enjoy the gorgeous weather. I pay for brunch since he got dinner. He leaves the tip ($6) in cash. $30 2:30 a.m. — We decide to walk off our brunch with a trip on foot to Astoria Park. It is hot! Already sweating, and we're only halfway there. We finally get to the park, and BF treats me to an ice cream cone since he feels bad about drinking the Bloody Mary. I tell him to not feel guilty, but I still take the cone! We find a shady spot and people watch in the grass. I snooze for a bit, and then we brainstorm plans for the rest of the afternoon. 3:30 p.m. — After running through our apps and Googling various goings-on about town, we decide to walk to Manhattan from Queens. It seems like a good idea at the time. 5:30 p.m. — BF and I joke about the extreme things we will do to avoid using the MTA on the weekend. After walking over the Triborough Bridge, around Ward's Island, and over the pedestrian bridge into Manhattan, we make it! We stop at a bodega for two giant bottles of water and walk to Central Park to see the Conservatory Gardens. $3 6 p.m. — The gardens are gorgeous, and I'm feeling a lot more upbeat after our long walk. We pick a park bench and watch a couple take engagement photos. The light is absolutely gorgeous, and it's so nice to be out in the sun the entire day! BF is in the mood to see a movie, but nothing good is playing, so we decide to ""treat ourselves"" and go to a comedy show. Downtown we go! 7 p.m. — We make it to the show after (more) subway delays. It's $10 apiece to see comedians try out new material. The BF pays, and it's surprisingly not as awkward as we anticipated. The headliner used to be on and does some hilarious bits. We head to Madison Square Park for dinner and basically attempt to reenact all of his jokes. 9:30 p.m. — The BF wants Shake Shack, but I'm not a fan, so I stop at a Mediterranean place and get a kale salad with falafel and roasted vegetables. BF changes his mind about Shake Shack and gets a wrap with meatballs and vegetables. I pay for dinner, and we walk to the park to sit outside. $20 10:30 p.m. — BF is again tempted by our proximity to Shake Shack and considers buying a burger for the ride home. Considering the line is still so long at 10:30 at night, he decides against it, and we head to the R train to go back to Queens. Fingers crossed the train runs smoothly. 11 p.m. — Shockingly, the train got us back to his apartment with no issues! My boyfriend's roommates give him some flack for not being home for a while, so we hang out with them so they can get in some ""bonding time."" My BF has tomorrow off, but I have to go to work, so we get ready for bed. Lights out by midnight! Daily Total: $53",5,121
"8:15 a.m. — Here we go again: Alarm goes off, and I begrudgingly get up and ready for work. My boyfriend is still snoring away as I kiss him on the cheek and head out. 8:45 a.m. — Workday means Starbucks vanilla iced coffee. Old habits die hard, but it's still hot out and the cold coffee helps soothe my sore throat. Still waiting for those antibiotics to kick in; I'm getting tired of feeling so crummy. $3 9:15 a.m. — Slightly late to work, but I beat my boss in, so I'm safe. No one actually keeps track; I'm just stuck in the habit of being paranoid about working hours after working at much more intense jobs. I grab my usual bowl of Raisin Bran from the office kitchen, a glass of orange juice, and a cup of green tea. I will beat this strep! 12:30 p.m. — Fading fast after a busy morning catching up. I hope lunch, another coffee, and antibiotics will revive me. Make my salad since nothing else looks appetizing. I grab a bag of veggie chips from the snack area and work at my desk through lunch. 3 p.m. — Drag myself outside for a walk around Bryant Park. It's hot, and I come back to work sweaty. Grab a bottle of green tea and repurpose my Starbucks cup from this morning with fresh ice. I also add honey to help my throat, and grab a bag of edamame crisps to snack on. These things are addicting, although I can't decide if the flavor is all that pleasant. 5:15 p.m. — Leaving work. I have to go back to my apartment uptown before my band rehearsal tonight, since I stayed in Queens and didn't bring my instrument to work. I play in an adult wind ensemble, which is way cooler and more fun than it sounds. But the rehearsal is all the way in Brooklyn, and I live all the way uptown, so I cross my fingers for a speedy express A train. 5:45 p.m. — Home! I have 15 minutes before I need to head out again. I should straighten my apartment, but I instead lay on my bed and play Candy Crush for 20 minutes. Going to be late, but I make a berry and yogurt smoothie for the subway ride down. We usually go out for drinks after band practice, and I'll grab something else to eat post-rehearsal. 7:15 p.m. — Late for rehearsal. I clamor through 20 people to get to my seat in the middle of the stage; that never gets less embarrassing. It's such a stress reliever to play music for a few hours each week, and I've made some great friends! Once a band geek, always a band geek. 9:30 p.m. — Decide to head to the bar after rehearsal with some of the guys in my instrument section. I get a water since I shouldn't drink while I'm on antibiotics. Decide against ordering food because the wait is usually long, and I don't want to stay out too late. Chat for a few and then head to the subway for the hour-long trek back home. 11 p.m. — Home at last! I find a fruit bar in my work bag and eat that even though I'm not hungry. I call my BF to catch up on our days, but he's half asleep and the conversation is lagging. We hang up and I get ready for bed. I try gargling with salt water, a trick my mom had recommended every time she's texted me, and it works for five minutes. What is it like to swallow without stabbing pain? I go to bed and cross my fingers that tomorrow will be better. Daily Total: $3",6,121
"8 a.m. — Alarm goes off, but without the BF here to drag me out of bed, I fall back asleep until 8:30. Yikes! Take a quick shower and am out the door in 20 minutes. 9 a.m. — I stop at a coffee shop in my neighborhood for an iced Americano. I love the people who run this place; they're an Italian couple, and they sell the BEST pastries. My punch card is full with this purchase, so next time I come in, a free pastry will be mine! $2.50 9:30 a.m. — Late to work, and my boss is already at her desk. She says hello, and I relax. I need to either take a chill pill or stop over-sleeping. Raisin Bran and a glass of OJ from the office kitchen for breakfast. 10:30 a.m. — I clean out the email address I use for coupons and other junk mail, but see a deal for a $35 hot stone massage. I've never had one done, so I decide to treat myself. I'm usually pretty careful with these type of expenses since these coupon sites are like a black hole for me, but it's the end of the month, and I always get a little looser with the discretionary spending then. $35 12:30 p.m. — Lunch time. Grab my usual salad, and a bowl of coconut soup with lemongrass and shrimp. It's delicious. Top it off with dark chocolate from the office kitchen and another cup of green tea. 3 p.m. — I mix up my walking route and decide to go around Hell's Kitchen. It's not relaxing because the traffic is horrible. Definitely not a fan of this office location, but I make a mental note to try a few of the restaurants around Ninth Avenue. There's great happy hour specials around here! 4 p.m. — The end-of-the-day slump is happening! Time for green tea, and a KIND bar from the office kitchen. I can't even tell if I'm hungry or just bored. It's been a long day. 5 p.m. — Head out at 5 on the dot and try to get myself amped to go for a run once I go home. My BF is eating dinner with his parents tonight, so I have some downtime before we meet up. I'm running a half-marathon next month, but since I've been under the weather, I am way behind on my training. Hopefully I can get at least five miles in tonight. 7:30 p.m. — Made it five miles! Wasn't the best run, but I'm glad I went out anyway. Time for a shower. 8:30 p.m. — Literally no dinner food in this apartment. I shop this weekend and get myself together! I decide to order sushi from a new place in my neighborhood that's part sushi restaurant, part hookah bar — but isn't very expensive. I order an eel roll and a spicy tuna on Seamless and hope for the best. $13.50 9:15 p.m. — Sushi is good! I'll keep this place on my list. BF is on his way; we're watching together so I get Amazon Prime teed up. 10 p.m. — BF arrives; we catch up on our days, and he tells me about his family dinner. I'm feeling congested and still under the weather, so we crawl into bed for a low-key night of . I make a cup of chamomile tea to fully embrace this homebody evening. Lights out by 11:30! Daily Total: $51",7,121
"7 a.m. — I wake up and check my phone. I was on a panel last night, and there's a LinkedIn request from one of my fellow panelists. I recently graduated from a master's program, and the career counselor of the program invited me to sit on a panel of alumni to talk about our careers. I was by far the youngest and least experienced person on the panel, and I think I offered a unique perspective to the current students as someone who was very recently in their shoes. 7:50 a.m. — After sending a few photos of our cat to my fiancé who is currently out of town, I eat a breakfast of cereal and milk. I usually pack a lunch for work in the mornings, but my brother and I finished off the last of our leftovers last night, and we're running low on groceries. I plan to buy Subway for lunch; Subway texts me coupons every week, and more often than not, I end up using them. 8:20 a.m. — I always listen to Audible on my morning commute, and David Sedaris' is so funny that I don't want to get out of my car when I get to work. I eventually do go into the office and make myself coffee from the free Starbucks coffee machine in the break room. It's been really nice not having to spend so much money on K-Cups for my Keurig ever since I started working here. 9:30 a.m. — I catch up with a coworker who is getting married in three weeks. We both started at this company around the same time, and we both got engaged earlier this year. She's stressed about all the final preparations she needs to make for the wedding, but she's also getting really excited for the big day. Ever since I got engaged in June, I've been trying to extract advice from everyone I know who either recently got married or is getting married sometime soon. 11 a.m. — A vendor brings Waffle House catering to our office. This was a great day not to pack a lunch! The very friendly caterer makes me hash browns with cheese, ham, jalapeños, onions, and tomatoes. I also grab a waffle with butter and chocolate chips and a cup of Greek yogurt. I end up eating the yogurt and half of the waffle and hash browns during a meeting with two of my managers. 12:45 p.m. — Fiancé is a fourth-year med student with almost $200,000 of student debt. When I got this job, we decided that I would take the money that I would have otherwise put towards retirement savings and instead use it to start paying off his loans. As a couple, we effectively combine our finances, and we decided it was better to pay off his loans sooner and start saving for retirement a little bit later. We decide to start paying off the highest-interest loans first, and I make the first payment at my desk between sips of orange juice that I got from the Waffle House catering. I meant to start these payments a while ago, but a combination of lack of information, wanting to build up my personal savings, and laziness meant that I'm just now making the first payment almost five months into my job. $700 2 p.m. — Fiancé texts me that a recent episode of John Oliver's show freaked him out about credit card security, and he wants to put a security freeze on my personal credit card information so no one else can use it. Basically, I have to pay money so that Equifax won't sell my information to anyone, and thus, hackers can't access it, or something like that. I tell him to go for it, and Venmo him the money. I make a mental note to watch that John Oliver segment later so I can actually understand what he's talking about, but in the meantime, I trust his judgment. $13 3 p.m. — I get bored and hungry waiting on code to run, so I grab some snacks from the break room. We have a great selection of free snacks at my company, as well as a Coke Freestyle machine. Today, there's even a bowl of fruit sitting out. I get a small bowl of Chex Mix, a cup of Diet Coke, and an apple and head back to my desk. 6:45 p.m. — I had planned to go to the gym today, but I end up staying late at work and decide to just go straight home. 7:15 p.m. — I make a chicken and pasta dish from Blue Apron. I'm the chef of the household and usually cook for me and  my brother (and whoever else is around), but my brother has to stay late at school for a student government meeting, so tonight it's just me. When fiancé is here, he pays for all groceries for our household, including the Blue Apron meals. He is essentially living with my brother and me part-time this year, since he has to go back and forth between Atlanta and New Orleans for his fourth-year med school rotations. Given his lack of income, the fact that he shares a room with me, and his part-time status, my brother and I agreed that we didn't need him to pitch in for rent or utilities, and that buying groceries would be an acceptable contribution. Even though he isn't in Atlanta this month, he still bought us Blue Apron meals that we could cook while he's away. 8:45 p.m. — I clean the kitchen, then watch the new episode of . My brother texts me about potentially canceling our gym membership. He doesn't go often enough for it to be worth it, and I am perfectly content working out in our apartment building's fitness center. Fiancé does really like going when he's here, though, so I suggest we discuss the matter when he gets to Atlanta later this week. 11 p.m. — I watch a few episodes of (such a good show), snuggle with my cat, and go to bed.

"6:20 a.m. — My brother's kitten scratches at my door, so I let her in. She immediately starts play-fighting with my cat, so I kick them both out and close the door. I'm able to get a little more sleep before my alarm goes off. 7 a.m. — Get up, get dressed, and have cereal and milk for breakfast again. I pack leftover chicken and pasta from last night for lunch, along with an apple. 8:20 a.m. — Get to work and make myself a coffee. A new guy just started working here this week, so I spend a few minutes chatting with him. He seems to like working here so far. 12 p.m. — I have a busy and productive morning at work, and one of my coworkers invites me to join a group going out to lunch. Although I packed a lunch today, I accept the invite. Since I'm still relatively new here, I take every opportunity to socialize with and get to know my coworkers, both during and outside of work. I'll just leave my packed lunch in the office fridge and eat it tomorrow. We go to an authentic Italian deli, and I get a prosciutto and mozzarella sandwich, a lemon anginetti, and a cup of water. $9.36 1:10 p.m. — Oh no! When I agreed to go out to lunch, I completely forgot I had a 1:00 meeting, and I don't realize my mistake until after the meeting has already started. I rush back to the office and sneak in about 10 minutes late. 5:45 p.m. — Tomorrow is my coworker's last day at the company, so a bunch of us leave work a little early to go to a pub for a going-away party. I end up having a really nice time, and I'm one of the last people to leave around 8:45 p.m. I get a glass of cider, a bourbon-based mixed drink, a grilled cheese, and a cup of tomato soup. I box up half the grilled cheese to take home for a lunch this week. One of our managers sneakily pays for the first round of drinks before he leaves, so I don't have to pay for the cider. I tip 20%, as always. $21.42 9:15 p.m. — I get home and straighten up my apartment a bit in preparation for my mom coming to visit tomorrow. I notice my brother has done the dishes, and I tell him that I appreciate it. In our household, I do all the cooking, and he does all the dishes. When fiancé is here, he does all the other kitchen cleaning (mostly wiping down counter tops and cleaning the floor). When he's not here, my brother and I split those tasks. 10 p.m. — Two of my friends separately text me inviting me to a Shabbat picnic-in-the-park event they're going to on Friday. The three of us are basically the only young Jews we know in Atlanta (besides my brother), so we try to do the occasional Jewish event together. Fiancé is coming back to Atlanta Friday afternoon, and even though he isn't Jewish, he says he'd be interested in the event as well. I get us both tickets, which include a meal and a drink each. $10 11:15 p.m. — I watch an episode of and an episode of , then I hit the hay. Daily Total: $40.78",2,122
"5:45 a.m. — My cat wakes up and starts meowing, scratching himself, eating from his food bowl, and generally making a racket. I try to block out the sounds, but I get barely any sleep before my alarm is supposed to go off. 7:15 a.m. — My alarm did not go off for some reason, but thanks to my cat, I'm awake anyway. Of course, now that it's time for me to get up, he's sitting sweetly and peacefully on the bed, not making a sound. Where was this behavior an hour ago? 8 a.m. — Cereal and milk again for breakfast. 8:40 a.m. — Get to work and make myself some coffee. 11 a.m. — Get a Snapchat from my brother showing that my mom has arrived safely. They are apparently at my mom's favorite brunch spot to visit when she's in town. Feeling a little FOMO. 11:30 a.m. — Had another busy morning and decide to eat an early lunch, so I heat up the chicken and pasta that I left in the fridge yesterday. I also rinse the apple I brought and get some ice water from the water machine in the break room. While eating, I call my insurance company to cancel a claim I filed last week. I was rear-ended on my way home from work, and I heard from the other lady's insurance company that they are (rightfully) accepting full liability for the accident. It's such a pain to deal with this, and such a bummer it happened to my new car. But no one was hurt, and the damage wasn't too bad — it could have been much worse. Plus, my amazingly helpful mother has agreed to take my car in to the shop to get an estimate for the damages tomorrow while I'm at work. One of my coworkers has agreed to drive me, so it all works out really well. 12:15 p.m. — Back to work. My to-do list just keeps growing. 4 p.m. — I finally come up for air after staring at my computer for basically four hours straight. While I wait for some code to run, I check my phone, grab some Cheez-It's and Peanut M&M's from the break room, and refill my cup of water. I really should remember to bring a thermos to work; I use one disposable cup each on coffee and water or soda every day. They're free, but I know it's wasteful. 4:40 p.m. — My manager schedules a meeting that's supposed to end at 6:30 p.m. I have plans tonight with a friend downtown, which can be an hour-and-a-half drive or longer to get to from my work during rush hour. (My office is in a small city just outside of Atlanta.) I text her saying I'm not sure what to do; we're supposed to see a show, and they say they will lock the doors promptly at 8. It's not a huge deal if I miss the show (it only cost $5), but I don't want to let her down. She says it's not a big deal, and she can find someone else to go with her. She Venmos me back the $5 she used to buy my ticket. We're seeing each other tomorrow at the Shabbat event anyway, so I don't worry too much about it. 6:45 p.m. — I'm finally leaving work, and my mom texts to say she'll pay for take-out if I'll pick it up on the way home. My brother and I each get a fried chicken sandwich with a side of grits and green beans; my mom gets a salmon salad. She also wants me to pick up some Coke Zeros on the way home. I use the credit card I have that's linked to my parents' account to pay for everything. I've had this credit card probably since middle school, and I only ever use it if my parents want me to buy something on their behalf. 9:15 p.m. — I work on some crosswords from a book of crossword puzzles in my living room while my brother studies for an exam and my mom works on her computer. The cats chase each other around the apartment. 11 p.m. — I watch the new and , text my friends to confirm plans for tomorrow, snuggle with my cat, and go to sleep. Daily Total: $0",3,122
"6:35 a.m. — I wake up early. Instead of going to the office today, a group of around 20 women from my company are attending a conference about women in leadership. I do my hair and makeup and pick out a business formal outfit. My office has a semi-casual dress code, so it's kinda fun to get dressed up every once in a while (but I'm definitely glad it's not every day). I wear a dress, a black blazer, black tights, and Spanx underneath. The founder of Spanx, Sara Blakely, will actually be speaking at the conference today! 7:25 a.m. — My coworker picks me up since my mom is taking my car into the shop today. On the way, she suggests we stop by Dunkin' Donuts. I agree and insist I pay for both of us to thank her for driving me. We each get a small coffee, and we share a bagel with cream cheese. $6.17 8 a.m. — We get to the hotel where the conference is hosted, and it turns out there is breakfast provided. We probably shouldn't have stopped at Dunkin' after all; oh well. I drop my business card in the raffle bowl and head to my seat right as the conference begins. There is a swag bag at every seat, which contains some freebies including a lip balm, a key chain, and a notebook. 10 a.m. — Fiancé texts that he's leaving New Orleans; he'll arrive in Atlanta around 6 p.m. tonight! 10:45 a.m. — My mom texts from the collision center where she took my car. Apparently, the damage is worse than I thought, and the mechanic has deemed my car ""not fit to drive."" The repairs will take about two weeks, and in the meantime, I'll drive a rental car. So frustrating! Thank god the other lady's insurance is covering all this, and thank god I have such an amazing mother who is willing to take several hours out of her day to help me with this problem. 12 p.m. — We have a 15-minute break before lunch is served. I chat with my coworkers and grab a free Diet Coke. 12:15 p.m. — Lunch is delicious. I have a salad with goat cheese and candied pecans, a pretzel roll with butter, roasted chicken with butternut squash risotto, a pumpkin spice macaron, and a vanilla cake pop. 1:15 p.m. — It's the moment we've all been waiting for: Sara Blakely's keynote speech. She is interviewed fireside-chat style by her childhood friend Chevy Arnold. Her story is really interesting: She actually founded Spanx in Virginia Highlands, a neighborhood here in Atlanta, with $5,000 that she saved selling fax machines door-to-door in Florida for seven years. Now, 17 years later, she was just named one of ' 100 Greatest Living Business Minds and is the sole owner of the billion-dollar company. Near the end of her speech, she announces that she is giving each conference attendee a free pair of Spanx's newest product, Arm Tights! Honestly, they seem a little silly, but I'm definitely excited to give them a try. 2:30 p.m. — To wrap up the conference, they announce the raffle winners. Some of the prizes include a Kendra Scott bracelet, a $50 meal delivery gift card, a one-night stay in a luxury hotel, and $100 Spanx gift card. I win one of the raffle drawings, but my prize is a book about leadership by a local author. It's cool that I won something, but I honestly don't really read hard copies of books these days — it's all about Audible for me. I can't help but envy the other raffle winners a little. 2:45 p.m. — The conference ends, and the group of women from my company go to the hotel bar for a company-sponsored happy hour. I order a $17 vodka-and-sparkling-rosé cocktail (it's good). One of the managers pays for everyone; she'll expense it later. 3:45 p.m. — People start getting up to leave. The coworker who drove me pays $17 for valet parking; she'll expense it later. I get home, catch up with my mom, shower, blow dry my hair, put on some makeup, and get dressed. I have the Shabbat event tonight, and afterwards I'm going out to a bar with some friends from my master's program. 6:15 p.m. — Fiancé gets here from New Orleans! I'm so excited to see him. He quickly changes clothes. He's happy to go out with me tonight, but I can tell he's kind of tired from the drive. I have a feeling tonight might be an early night. 6:45 p.m. — We get to the MARTA station, and I realize I forgot my Breeze card. Instead of buying another one, I just sneak in right behind Fiancé. I know it's illegal, and I don't like sneaking in, but we're already running pretty late for the Shabbat event, so I do it. 7:15 p.m. — We arrive at the park and collect our food and drink tickets. The food ticket includes an entree and two sides from the food truck, and the drink ticket includes a beer or wine from the bar. Fiancé gets a waffle cone filled with curry chicken and sides of vegan sausage with sweet potatoes and a flatbread with goat cheese and mint spread. I get a Parmesan waffle cone filled with lentils and two sides of the flatbread. He gets a beer from the bar, and I get a glass of white wine. One of my friends is already here; the other one is still at work, and probably won't be able to make it. 8:45 p.m. — The event is really lovely. When it's wrapping up, we say goodbye to my friend and walk over to another friend's apartment to meet up with the group that's going to the bar. The six of us take a Lyft Plus to the bar; I pay and tip $1. $16 9:30 p.m. — Fiancé and I play a game of darts against two of my friends. One of the guys from my master's program gets the first round of drinks; I have a sangria. 10:15 p.m. — The friend who didn't make it to the Shabbat event earlier buys the second round of drinks; I have another sangria. Fiancé and I win the darts game! 11 p.m. — Another guy friend gets the third round; I have a cider. Several more of our friends show up. 11:30 p.m. — The group decides to go to another bar to go dancing. Fiancé is worn out and wants to leave. I do want to stay and dance with my friends, but I haven't seen fiancé in a few weeks. Plus, I definitely know what it's like to want to leave a social situation, especially when the people aren't your own friend group. I call a Lyft Line; we don't pick up any other passengers, and we get a cheaper ride home! I pay. Once we get home, we go straight to bed. $10 Daily Total: $32.17",4,122
"8:45 a.m. — Wake up, and fiancé is still asleep. This is pretty unusual — I almost always sleep later than he does. I lie in bed and scroll through my phone until he wakes up. Once he does, we stay in bed to talk and snuggle for a while. 10:20 a.m. — We finally get out of bed. While he goes down to the package center to pick up a package, I make us each a mug of coffee and an English muffin with cheese and a fried egg. Today, I'm meeting with five of my grad school friends to work on a project that we started during school. Even though we're done with our master's degree, we've decided to keep working on one of our class projects with the goal of turning it into a real business. This is the first time all six of us will be meeting together in person since school ended. Fiancé and I scarf down our breakfast and leave to pick up one of my friends on the way to meeting the rest of the group. 11:30 a.m. — We arrive at a coffee shop, and I buy a coffee for fiancé and tea for me. I pay and tip. One of the other group members arrives. $7 12:30 p.m. — The three remaining members of the group finally show up an hour late. This is pretty typical — none of us are really known for being on time to social or school-related events. Two of them are extremely hungover from last night. I guess it's good fiancé and I left early! 1:15 p.m. — The friend who didn't make it to the Shabbat event last night throws up outside the restroom. I ask an employee if I can borrow a mop, but he says he'll clean it up. Sick Friend is feeling too nauseous to eat the bagel and cream cheese she bought, so she gives it to me. 2 p.m. — The wifi at the coffee shop keeps going out, so we decide to go Sick Friend's apartment and work in her building's study lounge. Fiancé drives me, the friend we picked up earlier, and Sick Friend in my car. She gets sick again on the drive, and I quickly hand her an empty tissue box to throw up in. Luckily, it's her apartment that we're going to, so she can shower when we get there. We park in a metered spot on a nearby street; I pay $8 for four hours of parking, but the friend we picked up earlier slips me a $10 bill. 4 p.m. — We make good progress on our project. I work on designing a logo. Sick Friend orders pizza for everyone, and I Venmo her $5. Fiancé and I each eat one slice. Fiancé goes to work out in the apartment's fitness center. $5 6 p.m. — We leave and drop my friend back off. On the way back to my apartment, we take the car through a car wash ($5). I borrowed my brother's car today, and I spilled some coffee on the car when I tried to dump it out the window earlier. We also stop for groceries and get lettuce, yogurt, eggs, champagne (for making French 75s with the gin I brought fiancé from London a few months ago), lemons, VitaminWater, angel hair pasta, two black and white cookies and some sliced Italian bread from the bakery, chicken breasts, arugula, a rotisserie chicken, apples, bananas, cream, milk, Caesar dressing, cereal, and some cases of Coke (Sprite Zero, Diet Coke, and Coke Zero Sugar). The total comes out to $127. Fiancé pays. $5 7:30 p.m. — My mom and brother help us get the groceries in from the car. I make chicken pasta and an arugula salad with lemon, olive oil, and Parmesan. Fiancé tries arugula for the first time tonight and is not a fan. 9 p.m. — Fiancé and I do a crossword puzzle, watch an episode of and . 11:50 p.m. — I notice the cat is almost out of food, so I order some more on Amazon ($18). I'll Venmo request fiancé for half the cost. Although we rarely pay each other back for things we spend money on, we always split pet expenses evenly for some reason. I also get a Spider-Man costume for fiancé as a gift ($39). It says the costume might not arrive in time for Halloween weekend, but expedited shipping is $40, so I decide to cross my fingers and risk it. $57 Daily Total: $74",5,122
"5:30 a.m. — Cat meows all morning. We finally have to lock him out of the room. Let us sleep in, kitty! 9:30 a.m. — Wake up. Fiancé has already been up for a little while. He went back to the store to pick up bacon and paper towels, and he is now studying for his big exam tomorrow. 10:15 a.m. — I put away some clean dishes from the dishwasher, and my mom starts doing the dishes. She says we're down to our last dishwasher detergent pod. Dang it! I wish we had known that before we went to the store. I make myself some coffee and put away some laundry. 10:45 a.m. — Fiancé's exam tomorrow is an eight-hour test of his skills interviewing patients. He'll have to do 12 mock interviews with actors pretending to be sick patients. Today, I help him practice for the exam by acting like a patient. In the first case we do, I'm a 25-year-old man who was recently in a car accident. In the second case, I'm a 28-year-old woman who has an unplanned pregnancy. He is pretty nervous and stressed, but I actually have a lot of fun acting sick and pregnant. 1 p.m. — Fiancé unwinds by watching some football. My mom and I make what my family has always called ""big breakfast,"" which is basically just any breakfast-type meal that includes eggs and either bacon or sausage. We make fried eggs, bacon, arugula salad, and toast and English muffins with melted cheese. I drink a glass of the iced tea my brother made a few days ago and have a small bite of a black and white cookie. My brother is currently out for a school event, so he misses big breakfast. 1:45 p.m. — I watch while Fiancé watches football and my mom watches . My friend texts me and asks to stay at my place tonight and ride with me to work in the morning; he's in town from Orlando for several interviews this weekend, including one at my company. I agree but warn him he'll be on the futon in the living room tonight, since my mom is visiting and occupying the guest room. 2:30 p.m. — I do another practice case with fiancé during halftime. Then I watch another episode of and the newest episode of . 6:30 p.m. — Fiancé heats up leftover chicken pasta, and I make a salad with romaine and an olive oil-based dressing. My brother gets home from his school thing, but he's already had dinner. My mom, fiancé, and I eat dinner and each have a glass of the rosé that I picked up from Fresh Market when they were having a wine sale last week. 7:30 p.m. — My coworker has a friend who is a fashion designer and a seamstress, and I reached out to her a while ago asking if she'd be interested in collaborating with me on a custom wedding dress for my upcoming wedding. I finally hear back from her, and she is really excited to work with me. I hope to use just the bodice of my mom's wedding dress (with her enthusiastic blessing) and create a custom skirt to go with it. I'm so excited to get started! 8:30 p.m. — Do a couple more practice cases with fiancé. This time I'm a depressed young man and a forgetful old woman. 10:30 p.m. — The friend who's staying with me tonight texts that he's finally on his way. Daily Total: $0",6,122
"6 a.m. — Cat is meowing again. Come onnnn. 7 a.m. — Alarm goes off. It's so much harder to get out of bed when fiancé is here to snuggle with. 7:45 a.m. — I make a bowl of cereal with milk for myself and one for the friend who stayed with me last night. We leave for work; I'm in the rental car today, it's raining, and I have trouble finding the windshield wipers. I chat with my friend about his upcoming interview on the drive instead of my usual Audible. I hope he starts working at my company! 8:45 a.m. — Show my friend to where he needs to go for his interview, then make myself a cup of coffee. 12 p.m. — I join the new hire and two other coworkers for lunch. We go to a cute little café where I order a turkey wrap, a side of marinated olives, and a cup of water, and I split a brownie with a coworker. One coworker pays for all four of us; she'll expense it later. I save half the wrap and olives for lunch tomorrow. 1:30 p.m. — A few male coworkers, including a manager, gang up on me to argue that we don't need feminism because women in America already have it way better than other places. I did not bring up this topic, nor do I engage in the conversation, but they say things like ""Look, we're making her mad,"" and ""You should tell her that joke about feminism that you told me earlier."" I feel extremely uncomfortable and pretty upset. In most spheres of my life, I have no problem getting into a passionate debate about feminism, but I'm not sure how to handle this sort of thing in the workplace. 6 p.m. — Still feeling pretty bummed about earlier when I leave work. Fiancé's exam won't be over for another few hours. I wish I could talk to and snuggle with him. At least my mom and brother are around and are totally validating my feelings. 6:30 p.m. — I pick up a package from the package center, and it turns out to be the cat food I just ordered a couple days ago. Gotta love Amazon. 7 p.m. — Lie on the couch and try to unwind by scrolling through Facebook, but everything I see is heartbreaking and depressing. A famous New Orleans chef has been accused of sexual harassment. NYPD officers allegedly raped a teenager. A foster care company is under investigation for the unexpected deaths of almost 100 children in its care. There is just so much pain and suffering in the world. 8 p.m. — I'm still feeling down in the dumps, so my mom orders some pizza, my ultimate comfort food. We get pepperoni pizza with mushrooms (on her half) and onions (on my half), cheesy bread, garlic knots, and chicken tenders. She pays. With my pizza, I have a Sprite Zero and another glass of the rosé. Neither my brother nor Fiancé are home yet, but they'll definitely enjoy the pizza leftovers tonight or tomorrow. I text my friends about Halloweekend plans and watch the newest episode of . 10:45 p.m. — Fiancé finally gets home from his exam. He thinks he did well, but he's clearly anxious to get his score back. We talk a little about what upset me today at work, and he's very supportive. He eats some leftovers, and I go to bed.

"9:30 a.m. — Wake up and go to the kitchen to make coffee. Almost 11 weeks have passed since the car accident that broke my back. I suffered a burst fracture on my fifth lumbar vertebrae, the last one before the sacrum (or ""tailbone""); and by burst, I mean the bone pretty much shattered. Little pieces shot into my spinal cord, luckily only leaving me only with some residual numbness and weakness in my right foot and toes. I'm still in a brace that prevents me from bending at my waist at all, but overall I'm feeling much better than I did a few weeks ago. I no longer have any pain, and mentally I'm feeling really positive. My husband E. turns on the Champions League game on the TV, and we watch Tottenham play Real Madrid. Both of us are playing fantasy football for the Champions League with friends. I've been in the lead so far but after today's game, my lead is a lot less comfortable. I buy a new PlayStation controller online since we notice ours isn't working so well. $16.99 4 p.m. — My sister C. comes home from school. One of the most challenging part of being temporarily disabled is that I don't currently drive and rely on my family for rides. We go to the local nursery, Green Acres, to shop for pumpkins to get in the Halloween spirit. I find a really interesting looking one and a cute mini-succulent that I decide to get for a friend's birthday party next week. I also buy a cool fern that's half-off — I'm a sucker for plants. $18.38 6 p.m. — Tacos at our favorite Mexican place for dinner. I order a couple of carnitas tacos and E. gets a carnitas torta. $13.10 8 p.m. — Stop by Sprouts on the way home to pick up collard greens, kale, cabbage, laundry detergent, and beer. C. and I have recently become obsessed with the movie , a sort of mock-umentary about modern vampire life. We had high aspirations to dress up like the main characters, but it's been very difficult to find their clothes online, and I don't have the means to go to a million thrift stores like I normally would. At home, I shop online for a while but don't commit to anything. Take my dog on a walk; he loves it, and it feels nice to stretch my back. Head to bed around midnight with the goal of waking up earlier than 10 tomorrow — my unattainable goal it seems. $36.10 Daily Total: $84.57",1,123
"10 a.m. — Wake up and get coffee, and then join my mom and sister outside to get some sun; can't beat California weather. Our interesting living situation has taken some getting used to. My husband, my sister, her boyfriend, my mom, and I all live together for the time being. My mom moved in after my accident and having her around for the extra help has been great. I scroll through my bank account and notice that the check I wrote our immigration lawyer a few weeks ago has been cashed by the USCIS. E. and I recently got married after having been together for over seven years, and we've started going through the immigration process. He was born in Mexico but was brought here when was 12 by his parents. I'm glad to know USCIS got our information. The lawyers say it will take about six months to hear back and schedule our interviews. Fingers crossed! $530 4 p.m. — Try to do some planning for our trip to New Zealand this December; I'm going with my sister and her boyfriend. I have a doctor's appointment in three weeks, and if my MD says my spine is stable, I'm going to go; if not, I'll have to cancel last minute. A package of things I ordered (orange blossom body spray and by Cheryl Strayed) arrives, and I agree to go shoe shopping with my sister. We go to DSW, and I don't find anything I like, but afterward, we go to a Halloween store where I buy vampire fangs for E. and me. $10.70 6 p.m. — Dinner at the taco place again; my sister and I share a carnitas taco salad and fish ceviche, and I order a beer. Back at home, I take out the new bedding I ordered during an Urban Outfitters sale last week. I like it! I've been doing a lot of online shopping lately, though, and I really need to watch my new bad habit. After, I work on a painting for a while and then watch with E. Can't believe I've never seen this movie before; it's so creepy and deep. I go to bed around midnight thinking about it. $11.97 Daily Total: $552.67",2,123
"10 a.m. — Wake up, make coffee, and watch a few videos and a documentary about Scientology with E. I guess the movie last night got us thinking about it. We talk about what would make someone want to join a cult, and I make sautéed lacinato kale and a fried egg on toast for breakfast. E.'s birthday is next week, so I buy more of his favorite cologne online. I'm trying not to waste all this free time I have now that I wished I had when I was working. I study Spanish every day, have been working to getting my finances and retirement in order, and have been going through my house to minimize and donate what I don't need. $54.69 2 p.m. — Go to Trader Joe's with my sister to grocery shopping for the house. We buy tortilla chips, coconut milk, canned beans, olive oil, sparkling water, a few spices, bread, milk, half-and-half, yogurt, eggs, pumpkin-flavored mini-ice cream cones, crumbled feta, goat cheese, frozen pizzas, waffle cookies, peppermint tea, ginger, raspberries, sweet potatoes, cauliflower, tomatoes, peas, cucumber, asparagus, baby broccoli, and pita chips. We pay with our mom's card ($98.28). I barely make it in the house before opening the ice cream cones. They are delicious! 4 p.m. — My sister's BF comes home, and he drives us to Whole Foods, where I manage to not buy anything. I ask him to swing by KoJa Kitchen, a new Korean-Japanese fusion place, for a strawberry-mango-mint frozen lemonade. I also buy one for him. Later, my dad comes over for dinner. We get take-and-bake pizzas from Papa Murphy's; he buys. $5 Daily Total: $59.69",3,123
"11 a.m. — My sister wakes up panicked since her boyfriend's parents and their friend are visiting from Switzerland, and they are coming over for dinner tonight. E. and I offer to help get ready. After cleaning the whole house, we go grocery shopping for the meal — but first is lunch! We go to a local sushi spot, Blue Nami, and my sister pays with money my mom gave her. (I know she spoils us too much...) After, we walk over to Bloom, a local coffee shop, and I buy London Fog lattes for me and E. and tip $1. $9 1 p.m. — Head to the Mexican specialty store for taco meat and other supplies for the epic feast we are planning; my sister pays. M.'s parents are European, so we feel they rarely eat great tacos. Head to Sprouts for a few other veggies, and my sister buys again. We walk over to Bev Mo, and I offer to buy a six-pack to share, and E. picks out his own bottle. The dinner is a huge success! We make carne asada, shrimp and grilled veggies for the tacos, and talk about European politics and the environment. Everyone leaves around 10 p.m. $17.51 Daily Total: $26.51",4,123
"11 a.m. — The day starts off slow. My sister and her boyfriend are going to a wedding this afternoon. E. and I take the dog for a walk in the park and kick around a soccer ball a little. E. mentions how much he loves the movie , and I later find it on eBay and buy it. $4.08 5 p.m. — After dropping off C. and M. at their friend's house, we head to Trader Joe's again. We get coffee, half-and-half, bananas, sausages, pretzel rolls, cucumber, popcorn, chips, cottage cheese, manchego cheese, tamales, and a few other staples; Mom pays ($58.91). We head home and I make up a cheeseboard as a snack. A few weeks ago, I made homemade lacto-fermented pickles and cauliflower; they still taste good, and I add them to the plate. I put sausages on pretzel rolls for the main course, and Mom, E., and I start a movie marathon: , and , and . I go to bed around midnight. Daily Total: $4.08",5,123
"11 a.m. — Wake up. Sister and her BF are a little hung over from the party last night and offer to drive to pho for an early lunch. E. and I both get beef brisket and raw, thinly sliced beef, and I order a jackfruit smoothie. $24.77 1 p.m. — We head over to Goodwill to see if they have anything that will work for our Halloween costumes. I finally find a shirt that will work for my costume and E. finds a long black robe and white face paint. I round up my total to make a small donation. $22 4 p.m. — Go to the mall to return a dress at Urban Outfitters; they sent me the wrong size in the mail, and I get $25.73 back. E. finds pants at the Gap for only $10. $10.70 5 p.m. — Zócalo is across the street so we decide to head over for happy hour. I order two sangrias, E. gets a beer, and we both order flautas and queso fundido to snack on. It is so rich, and we all head home close to food coma. Instead of napping, though, we take our dog on a long walk, and I feel a lot better. E. and I stay up and watch . I go to bed feeling uneasy and make sure to lock all the doors. $30.06 Daily Total: $87.53",6,123
"11 a.m. — Wake up, have a little coffee, and shower. My cousin Holly picks up my sister and me for coffee and pastries at Ettore's. Going from having my own car and being able to go anywhere I wanted, pretty much any time, to really having no independence has taught me patience. I appreciate that my disability is temporary; health is everything! Our cousin vents to us about her husband and one-year-old baby, and seems so happy to get a break. We get a ham-and-cheese croissant, a chocolate croissant, an apricot Danish, and coffee. I also pick up a loaf of bread and a fresh fruit pastry for E. $16.80 1 p.m. — After pastries, we go to Target and walk down every aisle. I end up getting some truly random items: socks, pads, glow-in-the-dark nail polish, mason jars, pickles, and a notebook. It's just nice to be out of the house! $31.81 2 p.m. — We get dropped off at home. E. is resting on the couch and tells me he walked to lunch and got ingredients for soup night. Every Monday night, my sister, her boyfriend, E., and I take turns making a soup. Tonight, he is making black bean and roasted poblano pepper soup. $30.55 4 p.m. — E. needs a few more things for his soup, so we get my mom to drive us to Safeway. We buy the rest of the soup makings and a couple of other random things: queso fresco, cucumber, avocado, bok choy, Anaheim peppers, cilantro, and a couple of craft beers to share. Dinner is great, and we spend the rest of the night drinking red wine and painting. Life isn't too bad when you have awesome people around you. $17.11 Daily Total: $96.27",7,123
"8 a.m. — I finally wake up after snoozing a few times. I had a hard time sleeping last night (hello, night anxiety). I finally pull myself out of bed and get ready for Monday. I feed my two pet rabbits and refill their hay; they're both rescue rabbits and I love them so much. I'm out the door by 8:45. 9:30 a.m. — I get into the office and fill up my water bottle. I work in advertising, and we have a new-ish client who is super demanding. I spend most of the morning in a meeting on a new set of emails we have to deliver. 12:30 p.m. — Finally time for lunch. I usually bring lunch, but I didn't prep anything for today, so I go out for a turkey sandwich and chips. I also have a soda from the stash I keep at my desk. I know soda is bad for me, but I don't drink coffee, so I'll have one if I really, really need the caffeine. $9.34 3 p.m. — I take a break from work to shop online. I'm going to a wedding back home in the Midwest next weekend with my roommate, W. I go a little crazy on ASOS Curve and order five dresses and some rings. Their return policy is great though, so I'll send back whatever doesn't work. $283.95 6 p.m. — After a frustrating afternoon at work, I'm finally on my way home. I stop by the grocery store to pick up a few things I need for dinner: honey, Dijon mustard, and chicken, which is on sale for 40% off. I also pick up an orange. $18.97 8:30 p.m. — Done with dinner. I made honey-Dijon marinated chicken with mashed potatoes and roasted green beans. W. comes home and we eat together and chat. We got into a little disagreement yesterday (over what turns out to have been a silly miscommunication), and talk about it. W. is my best friend from college, and we're super close. He recently started dating a new guy, and it's caused a little bit of tension. We talk about everything and hang out for a while. Daily Total: $312.26",1,124
"7:30 a.m. — I wake up a little bit earlier today, take a shower, and do some things around the house, including bunny duty. I also make a smoothie, using frozen berries from Trader Joe's, a banana, almond milk, kale and spinach, and Tone It Up protein powder my sister convinced me to buy a few months ago. I put it in a disposable cup from a set I bought from Amazon last week. I know I should use a reusable tumbler, but to be honest, I think lugging around a dirty tumbler would dissuade me from drinking the smoothies. 8:45 a.m. — I get a seat on the subway and open my book. I finished up last week (I hated it), and now I'm starting . 9:30 a.m. — I get to work. I'm writing a few website pages for that new client. I usually like writing web copy, but this client is so annoying and I am frustrated. 11:45 a.m. — I reheat leftover chicken and mashed potatoes in the office microwave. I throw the green beans in the toaster oven in an attempt to crisp them; it almost works. While I eat, I read a long-form article at my desk. I like to bookmark interesting articles on my computer and come back to them when I have a break or eat my lunch. 12:30 p.m. — A few weeks ago, I noticed that one of my favorite leather bags was starting to fall apart — the piece that connected the strap to the purse was wearing out. I contacted the company, and they told me I could get it repaired and get reimbursed later ($50). I walk to a local shoe shop and drop my baby off. 2:20 p.m. — After a long (but professional) argument with my creative partner about some web pages, I go to the office kitchen in search of a snack. I go back to my desk with a cup full of pretzels and two chocolates from the receptionist's desk. 4 p.m. — There's leftover food in the office kitchen. Since I won't be able to eat dinner until late, I grab a half-sandwich and salad. 5:45 p.m. — I leave work and stop by Walgreens to pick up new tweezers since mine disappeared, and a bottle of water. I'm taking a screenwriting class at a local college, and tonight is the first one! I'm really excited about it — and my company paid for the course. $13.09 9:30 p.m. — I finally make it back to my neighborhood. I stop by a bodega to grab milk for mac and cheese. To make the credit card minimum, I also buy a pint of ice cream, which I put in the freezer after I get home. I make and eat my pasta, wash my face, and immediately go to bed. $9 Daily Total: $22.09",2,124
"8 a.m. — I wake up late today and rush to get ready. My office is very casual, so I put on a t-shirt and cardigan with high-waisted black jeans and a pair of ""smoking"" flats. I make my smoothie and am out the door by 8:45. 12 p.m. — I spent most of my morning writing a print advertisement for one of my favorite clients, and then in a meeting about another. My boss treats us to lunch today; I put in my order (a turkey and brie sandwich), which I eat at my desk while writing a radio commercial we need to submit ASAP. 6:15 p.m. — After yet another long meeting about our creative direction for our difficult client, I finally head out. I make it in time for a 7 p.m. cardio kickboxing class at the gym by my house. It totally kicks my ass and I am a sweaty mess afterwards, but I feel better. I get back on the subway to take the two stops home. 8 p.m. — When I get home, I immediately start prepping a late dinner. I wash rice and put it in the rice cooker, and throw some of Trader Joe's honey-walnut shrimp in the oven to bake. I shower, change into pajamas, and then come back in the kitchen to microwave a bunch of frozen broccoli. I eat my dinner (expertly paired with a hard cider) while watching an episode of .

"7:30 a.m. — I wake up late and rush to get ready. Since I showered last night, I just put on light makeup, get dressed, and feed the rabbits. I skip my morning smoothie and am out the door by 8. Once I get to the metro, I realize I left my monthly card in my jeans pocket, so I have to buy a single-ride. I am annoyed at myself. $3 9:02 a.m. — I make it to my therapy appointment, a bit sweaty and a couple minutes late. I decided to start going to therapy a few months ago, mostly to talk about relationship/family/life stuff. I cry literally every time, no matter what we're talking about; it's weird. I put my co-pay on my credit card so I at least get points. $30 10 a.m. — Roll into work and start rewriting a web page we talked about yesterday. 12:15 p.m. — I am so hungry since I missed my smoothie this morning. I heat up the leftover chicken, potatoes, and beans I was supposed to eat yesterday, but it isn't very good. While I eat, I check my bank balance and notice that my automatic student loan payment has been taken out. I went to a public university in my home state; my parents did not contribute to my tuition or living expenses. I took a lot of AP classes and worked part-time throughout high school, so I graduated with my bachelor's (a double major) in three years and about $22,000 in student loan debt. I've been paying it off for five years, and have about $4,800 left to pay. 1:25 p.m. — I take a break from work to order an apple peeler/corer/slicer from Amazon. I've been meaning to get this for a while. $18.99 2:30 p.m. — My coworker and creative partner wants to grab a coffee, so we head out. I pick up my repaired bag (it looks great!) and we stop by Eataly. I can't resist buying a scoop of tiramisu-flavored gelato. $4.90 5:15 p.m. — I head out a little early today and catch the subway exit door just as someone else is leaving. (So I get in without having to pay. I don't really feel that guilty.) I stop by the grocery store near my house and buy five apples, a package of garlic, and some 7Up. $8.49 6:30 p.m. — A former coworker (and current friend) comes over. She recently moved into my neighborhood and we both love food, so we get together about once a week to cook together. She brought brussels sprouts and baby potatoes, both of which we roast with garlic and olive oil. (The bunnies also try raw brussels sprouts for the first time, and they are Big Fans.) I also prepare steak, which is amazing. I used to be intimidated by cooking red meat, but I've been trying to expand my kitchen skills. I also make us brandy Old Fashioneds. We drink and watch an episode of . About a month ago, we bought Ben's season on Amazon and are slowly making our way through it. Olivia is the worst. 9:30 p.m. — My friend heads home just as another guest comes over, a guy I've been seeing (very) casually for about four months. We're not dating right now (a mix of both our schedules and some intense family stuff he's going through right now), but he sleeps over about once a week. We always have a great time together, and it feels healthy. We're both honest about where we're at, and we actually end up touching base on things tonight. Daily Total: $65.38",4,124
"8 a.m. — Dude left early this morning, but I snooze for a bit before getting up. As I'm stepping out of the shower, my mom calls. We chat while I get ready for work, which includes prepping my lunch, feeding and watering the bunnies, and putting on light make up. We wrap up the call as I'm heading out the door, this time with my MetroCard in hand. 10:30 a.m. — This morning is unusually slow for me, so I spend time Gchatting with one of my best friends, who lives in San Francisco. We haven't seen each other in a long time (over three years, thanks to cross-country airfares!) but we talk nearly every day. I also spend some time researching things to do in Paris. My roommate W. and I are going for almost a week around Thanksgiving (it'll be his first time there) and I'm really excited. 12:30 p.m. — I head out of the office to stretch my legs and to grab fresh chips from a nearby Chipotle to supplement my lunch. I head back into the office to reheat it; I made a homemade burrito bowl with brown rice, seasoned chicken, lots of lettuce, refried beans, and cheese. It is absolutely amazing and I end up sharing a bit with my creative partner, who sits across from me. $1.63 5 p.m. — After a long afternoon, W. and I meet up for a post-work movie. We use movie passes to buy our tickets to . I always make sure to maximize our savings by using rewards cards for theaters — and we have enough AMC points to score a free popcorn and soda combo. 8 p.m. — The movie was terrible; not even Idris and Kate could save it. Once we're home, we're both too tired to do much else, but I do make homemade pie crust and use my new apple peeler/corer to make impromptu apple dumplings. This is my first attempt, and they're not amazing, but they'll do. We eat them while watching a few episodes of on Netflix. Daily Total: $1.63",5,124
"8 a.m. — W. and I both get up early because we have a jam-packed fall day planned! After getting ready, we make smoothies and head out the door to drive into Long Island to go to a farm. W. and I share the large majority of our expenses, so I have a running spreadsheet that I update every few days. Everything I spend today will eventually go into the spreadsheet, and he will pay me his half via Venmo later in the month. 10 a.m. — We get to the farm, but realize that the pumpkin patch is further up the road. We're both hungry, though, so we buy two apple cider donuts and a water for me. $8 10:15 a.m. — We get back into the car and go up the road. The patch is full of great pumpkin choices, and it doesn't take long for us to get six pumpkins — enough for the pumpkin carving pumpkin we're hosting tomorrow at our apartment. $35 11 a.m. — We head to the apple orchard, but realize they have a picking minimum. I only need enough apples for a pie, so we decide to head back to the main farm area because W wants to do the corn maze. We pay for admission and a Gatorade for W, and head in; the maze is a little anxiety-inducing, but we manage to get through it in 20 minutes! $14 11:30 a.m. — We head into the main farm building/store so I can buy those apples. I also insist on getting three sugar pumpkins, baby pumpkins for decorating our apartment, and apple cider. $25.12 12 p.m. — Since we're already so far out in Long Island, I drag W. to the West Elm Warehouse store at Tanger Outlets. We don't end up getting anything, despite falling in love with basically everything. 12:30 p.m. — After some quick research, we decide to go to a local seafood spot for lunch. I've been wanting to try out scallops after the latest season of , so we get some as an appetizer, and then split the “clam bake,” which includes a whole lobster, shrimp, clams, mussels, corn on the cob, and a baked potato. It comes with only one bib and a tiny fork, which indicates that this entire thing is meant for one person. We're barely able finish it. W. also gets a glass of wine and I get a Coke. $63.17 2 p.m. — We head to a local grocery store to get supplies for tomorrow. I want to make vegetarian chili (two of our guests don't eat meat), so I pick up red beans, pinto beans, black beans, vegetarian broth, an onion, crushed tomatoes, two jalapeño peppers, green onions, sour cream, and cheddar cheese. We also get a big thing of olive oil, spreadable butter, oranges, 7Up and Squirt, and Cool Whip. $60.22 2:45 — Quick stop for gas. $25 3:30 p.m. — W. decides he wants to stop by Dairy Queen for a Blizzard. He orders brownie and I get strawberry cheesecake. It's not very good and I regret it almost instantly. I only finish a third of it and am annoyed at myself for getting anything. $9.86 5:30 p.m. — Back in Brooklyn. We stop by the liquor store on our way home to get brandy for tomorrow and a few bottles of white wine. $58.68 9:30 p.m. — We spend most of our evening prepping for tomorrow and jamming out to Musical soundtracks ( , , and ). I roast the sugar pumpkins and make puree, most of which I freeze. I also make an apple pie (with a crumble top), a pumpkin pie, and roast the pumpkin seeds. I give the bunnies some of the apple peel, which is their absolute favorite treat. Then it's time for bed. Daily Total: $299.05",6,124
"9:30 a.m. — I get up a bit later than usual. W and I talked about going to a Zumba class together this morning, but decide we don't have enough time with everything we want to do before people come over. I make the chili in the crockpot and clean the kitchen, while W. takes care of the bunny area, vacuums, and Swiffers. I also decide to make homemade soft pretzels for the first time! I make half the dough as traditional pretzels and the other half as bites. They turn out really well. After prepping for most of the morning, I shower and get ready. 11:45 a.m. — W. and I run out to grab a couple of last-minute items for our party: tea lights for the jack-o-lanterns, a plastic tablecloth for easy clean up, fancy mustard for the pretzels, and ice cream for our pie, $19.77 2 p.m. — Our friends come over. We have a great time drinking Old Fashioneds and wine, carving our pumpkins, and eating. The pretzels are a definite hit. We also play “Red Flags,” a fun Cards Against Humanity-type game. Everyone at the party is single (except W. and his new love interest), so some of the flags hit a little too close to home. Everyone leaves around 9, and I do the bare minimum of cleaning before washing my face and going to bed. Daily Total: $19.77",7,124
"8 a.m. — The alarm goes off but I've been awake since 7:30 a.m. I’m an early riser by nature. 8:15 a.m. — Breakfast time for the animals! I have two cats, two dogs, and a mini-pig. I love spending my morning with them on my days off. After breakfast, we go for a walk around the block. 9 a.m. — Monday is one of my two days off each week. I consider it an errand day, when I go grocery shopping and take care of what needs to be done. Today, I have a breakfast date with my coworker and best friend Roxanne Price. We live right next to each other and often go out to a local breakfast spot. We talk about the work week, our cats, video games, etc. We switch off on who treats for breakfast; this week, it's my turn. $24.50 10:30 a.m. — Meeting and workout session with my personal trainer and nutritionist. I have low blood sugar, so it’s very important that I'm on top of my fitness and diet plans. 12 p.m. — Protein shake and supplements after my workout. $10 12:30 p.m. — DMV registration is due on my car for the year. Cue work-life crossover, where I notice a local client across the room. We exchange knowing smiles while we wait. 2 p.m. — Grocery shopping time! I drive to Whole Foods in Reno, as it's the only shop that stocks everything I need. I purchase a week's worth of groceries, including chicken breasts, salad mix, salmon, fruits, and assorted vegetables. $209.67 3:15 p.m. — My phone goes off just as I get home and start unloading groceries. One of my regulars is at the ranch looking to visit with me. I quickly toss the cold items into the fridge and head out the door. 3:20 p.m. — I make a pit stop at Starbucks for coffee and egg-white bites since my lunch is now to-go. $12.56 4:11 p.m. — J. is one of my local regulars. We exchange a hug and a kiss, then head back to my room to negotiate. We decide to go with our usual — the GFE or Girlfriend Experience — with a few new positions. J. uses Viagra, so we return to the bar to have a drink and catch up while we wait for it to kick in. 5 p.m. — We head to the office to book our date. Amount Booked: $2,000. Amount Earned: $1,000 (after the house's cut) 6:45 p.m. — I get home from my appointment and finish putting away the groceries. 7:35 p.m. — Dinnertime! I prepare some of the salmon I purchased earlier and decide to make this a working meal. I eat in front of my computer while I respond to email inquiries. 8:15 p.m. — Evening walk with the dogs. 9 p.m. — Netflix and tea. I’m catching up on in anticipation of the next season! I only have so much time to watch television, so I carefully pick and choose shows to follow. 10 p.m. — I turn off the overhead light and read until I fall asleep. Daily Total Spent: $256.73 Daily Total Earned: $1,000 Room & Board: $0. We pay $32/day for room and board at the Ranch even on our days off, as long as we maintain a room. The $32 cost is waived if you book a certain amount each day: Sunday to Thursday, you need to book $1,000 (before the house cut). Friday and Saturday, that amount goes up to $1,500.",1,125
"7 a.m. — Wake up. Despite today being one of my normal days off, I’ve got a photoshoot scheduled. No sleeping in — there’s hair and makeup to be done! 8:35 a.m. —  I prepare egg whites at home and eat them in a pita wrap on the road to the blow-out bar for my hair and makeup appointment. 9 a.m. — Time for my appointment! I’m getting beachy waves and natural makeup done since this is for an outdoor fall photoshoot. Many people assume we only take boudoir images, but some of my most popular pictures are of me out and about, living life! $125.67 (including $20 tip) 11 a.m. — Time to meet my photographer at the park. We start out taking photos of me in cute outfits on a bridge in a dress, and work our way around the park with various outfit changes. $150 1:35 p.m. — We’re both getting hungry and the lights are starting to get a bit harsh, so we wrap up the shoot and go out for a sushi lunch, my treat. $66.67 (including $10 tip) 3:45 p.m. — Emails. So many emails. I spend my afternoon catching up on the online side of my business with website updates, emails, a new blog post, and more. 6:05 p.m. — Dinnertime! I grill chicken breasts for my meal, plus a few extras for the work week. 7:47 p.m. — I finish my day watching Netflix, reading a book ( ), and head to bed around 10 p.m. Daily Total Spent: $374.34 (including $32 room and board) Daily Total Earned: $0",2,125
"6:45 a.m. — I’m awake bright and early as it’s a work day! I start my day with a big cup of coffee, and a round of morning exercise. Stretching, Pilates, and strength-building exercises to keep my body in tip-top shape. Breakfast is my workday usual: egg whites, chicken breasts, and a protein shake, which I pack and take with me to work. 7:47 a.m. — Shower post-workout, then taking care of the animals and getting ready for work. I usually put my makeup on before I head to work since my shift begins promptly at 9 a.m. Today, I'm paying for a pet sitter. $15 8:45 a.m. — Out the door and on the way to the Ranch. 9 a.m. — My work shift begins. I check my emails while eating breakfast. 10:17 a.m. — The bell rings. Company! We all run out of our rooms and down the hallways to the front parlor, where we stand in a line and introduce ourselves to the gentleman that has just walked in. This is called a lineup. The gentleman walks up to the lady of his choice, takes her by the hand, and they then ""go on tour."" Since I am the one chosen, I take him around the back of the property and show off some of our bungalows and suites. The ranch is much larger than it looks from the front, so people are often surprised by the size of the facility! We wrap up the tour and head back to my suite to negotiate. 10:36 a.m. — We settle on $1,000 for our encounter, and head to the office to book the party. Here at the ranch, rather than ""having sex,"" we say we are ""having a party."" It’s a term that's unique to the industry, but one I’m rather fond of. When we book a party at the ranch, I take the guest to the ""Hooker Booker"" office where the transaction takes place. The cashier handles the financial information — rather than the ladies — to protect our guests' information. Amount Booked: $1,000. Amount Earned: $500 12:05 p.m. — After the party, I settle down in front of my computer to continue working on emails. There are several more bells during this time, but I'm not picked. 1 p.m. — The doctor has arrived. By law, all legal sex workers must visit the doctor each week for STD/STI testing. If she comes back positive for anything, the girl is unable to work. The doctor cost is $75/week, and once per month we have to do blood work, which brings the cost up to $110. This is a normal exam week for me. This expense must be paid by the working ladies, and isn't covered by insurance. $75 3:05 p.m. — Lineup, and once again I am picked. We go on tour, and negotiate a simple massage party.  I’m a trained massage therapist, so this is a frequent request. Amount Booked: $500. Amount Earned: $250. 4:10 p.m. — I break for lunch. Part of our room and board cost includes food and use of the kitchen. We get a hot meal daily, plus access to fruits, veggies, eggs, and leftovers, 24/7. I’ll tell you something — sex workers sure can eat. We certainly aren’t starving ourselves here! We have hot dogs, hamburgers, ribs, pulled pork, steamed veggies, and cake for dessert. I happily indulge. 9 p.m. — My shift is over, and I pack up and head home for the day. 9:35 p.m. — It’s late and I'm already tired. I drink another protein shake for dinner, tend to my animals, and tuck in. Daily Total Spent: $90 Daily Total Earned: $750",3,125
"6:45 a.m. — Notice a trend? I wake up early! Rather than working out this morning, I take my two dogs for a morning walk. This takes a bit longer, so I grab breakfast from Starbucks on my way to work. 8:47 a.m. — Starbucks stop for coffee and egg-white bites. $7.89 9 a.m. — The workday begins. 11:47 a.m. — Second lineup of the day, and I'm picked. This is a couple from out of town that came by to tour the place. They don't seem interested in sex, so I focus on giving them a great tour of the property. We get visitors throughout the week who come by to see the place and are more interested in what we do here. They tip me $20 for my time. Amount Booked: $20. Amount Earned: $10 2:45 p.m. — Fifteen minutes until Tea Party! Each week, the ladies of the Bunny Ranch have a meeting with the staff to go over that week's performance, upcoming events, notes of interests, and more. I leave my room and take a seat in the parlor. 3 p.m. — Tea Party is supposed to start. We’re operating on S.S.T (Sex-worker Standard Time) so Tea Party actually begins a bit later at 3:10. This week, I am ""Bunny of the Week"" and receive a box of soap and bath accessories as my reward. 4:05 p.m. — Tea Party ends, and it’s back to the computer. I just got my photos back from the photographer and spend time sorting through the images and posting them on social media. 5:55 p.m. — Company! I’m right in the middle of eating my lunch, too. I abandon my coffee and salad and head to lineup. I’m picked, and excuse myself for a moment to move my food to the fridge before heading back for a tour. We negotiate and settle on $2,200 for a romantic GFE encounter. GFE, or the Girlfriend Experience is my specialty. During a GFE party, there is an element of romance and connection with the other person. Lots of kissing and cuddling — think of honeymoon sex. Very lovey dovey, just the way I like it. Amount Booked: $2,200. Amount Earned: $1,100 8:09 p.m. — I spend the last hour of my shift showing one of the new girls how to set up her Twitter account. Social media is very important for us, as we can’t advertise in the traditional way. That online exposure can make or break your business. 9 p.m. — I head home from my shift. I needed a pet sitter today, so it was another $15. $15 9:35 p.m. — I arrive home and begin the nightly ritual of dinner, animal care, etc. I head to bed around 11 p.m. Daily Total Spent: $22.89 Daily Total Earned: $1,110",4,125
"6:17 a.m. — I’m up extra early today, as I want to get to work early and spend time with my pony, Merlin. He lives at the Bunny Ranch along with Dennis' mare, Cheyenne. (Fun Fact: the Bunny Ranch doesn’t have rabbits, it has horses.) The ranch has graciously cared for him alongside Cheyenne, which is a great work perk and a real money saver. 7:45 a.m. — I grab my pre-prepped egg whites and chicken breast and head to work. 9 a.m. — I finish up with Merlin and get ready for my shift. I have an appointment at 2 p.m. today and a natural makeup look was requested, so I keep that in mind while getting ready. I go through emails, message board postings, and social media until my guest arrives. 2 p.m. — My client arrives with a bouquet of lilies (my favorite), and Starbucks (also my favorite). This guy’s earning some serious brownie points for his awesome Deadpool t-shirt. A common misconception is that the ranch is very formal — quite the opposite is true! You dress however you feel most comfortable, from jeans and a t-shirt to a suit. I’m wearing a simple fall dress, since we discussed potentially going out together as part of our date. We negotiate, and he decides to join me, not just for dinner and a date, but also for the night! On average, I do one to two overnights each month. Amount Booked: $15,000. Amount Earned: $7,500 2:15 p.m. — While booking the party, I send a text message to my pet sitter and let her know that I’ll need overnight and morning care in addition to the normal daily walk. $50 2:35 p.m. — The date begins. We go for a walk in nearby Virginia City, then back to the ranch for intimate time together before dinner at Duke's. On an outdate, the client typically covers any activities that we do, so he pays this time. I'll sometimes treat my regulars to a meal or buy us surprise show tickets, etc. This isn't standard for all the sex workers, but it's something that I choose to do to show my appreciation. Afterwards, we head to a local coffee shop to relax, chat, and people watch. We head back to his hotel room for the night. Daily Total Spent: $50 Daily Total Earned: $7,500",5,125
"12 p.m. — Our date ends after breakfast and we part ways. I’ve already sent a text to management requesting today off. My request was approved, so I head home rather than stay at work. 12:45 p.m. — I get home, give my pets a big hug, and take an afternoon nap. We didn’t sleep much last night. (Imagine that!) 3:15 p.m. — I wake up hungry and head out to Basil, a local Thai restaurant, for soup and duck salad. I tip $5 tip. $25.15 4:45: p.m. — I do a little bit of shopping in downtown and buy a new massage oil for my room at work. $12.26 7:05 p.m. — Roxanne calls. She's home early from work and wants to know if I’d like to have dinner. She comes over to my place and we watch bad '80s zombie movies, drink wine, and enjoy a home-cooked meal. 11:45 p.m. — Roxanne heads home and I head to sleep. Daily Total Spent: $69.41 (including $32 room and board) Daily Total Earned: $0",6,125
"7:05 a.m. — Wake up, work out, animal care, breakfast. It’s an average Sunday morning for me! 9 a.m. — The workday begins. 1:17 p.m. — Lineup, and I'm picked. We negotiate a basic sex party for $900. Amount Booked: $900. Amount Earned: $450 2:10 p.m. — Something’s up; my stomach doesn’t feel 100%. I take a Tums, and the discomfort persists. I opt to head home early and rest up, as I have several big appointments next week. 3:45 p.m. — My stomach still is hurting. I try ginger ale, toast, nothing. Still hurting. 7 p.m. — Dennis texts and invites me out to family dinner. Each week, Dennis takes some of the ladies out to Chinese food on Sundays. We relax, hang out, and just enjoy each other's company. I think about it but decide to pass this week. My stomach is hurting even more. 9:05 p.m. — At this point, I’m now vomiting from the pain. That's not good. Roxanne drives me to the ER and waits with me. 11:10 p.m. — I’m admitted to the hospital overnight for appendicitis. I text Dennis and Suzette to keep them in the loop, and contact my dog sitter to let her know I’ll need overnight care. $50 11:30 p.m. — I eventually fall asleep thanks to the painkillers that are finally kicking in. I’m woken up throughout the night for vital checks, antibiotics, and more pain medicine. Roxanne left at some point after I fell asleep; she’s an amazing friend. Daily Total Spent: $82",7,125
"6 a.m. — It's Friday, but I have the day off from work since I have an out-of-town doctor's appointment. Not hungry enough for breakfast (I had a big dinner the night before), so I skip it. I'm participating in National Novel Writing Month (NaNoWriMo), so I peck at the keyboard until it's time to get ready to leave. 9 a.m. — Hit the road for my 11 a.m. appointment. I'm having top surgery (bilateral mastectomy) done in a week, so I'm going to the surgeon's office for a pre-operation appointment. Fortunately, I was able to find a surgeon fairly close by in Gainesville, which is about a one-and-a-half-hour drive from Jacksonville. I filled up my gas tank a couple days ago, so I'm set to go. 12 p.m. — When I leave the surgeon's office, I have to pay for my upcoming surgery upfront. Last year, during the Obama administration, my health insurance would've covered 80% of the cost. However, my policy changed with the shift in the political climate . Now there is no coverage. I could fight the decision, but that would likely mean a legal battle that'll cost me more than the surgery. In short, Jeff Sessions owes me roughly $4,500. I'm bitter. Since I'm paying out of pocket, the surgery costs $5,700. I transfer the money from my savings account to my checking account at the surgeon's office. I've been saving this money for about three years — most of it in 2014 and 2015, when I was still living at home. I have to call the bank and go through a security check to prove I'm not committing fraud, but finally the transaction goes through. $5,700 2 p.m. — I drive back home to Jacksonville and eat lunch at my apartment. It's leftover chicken ravioli that I made two nights ago and my last clementine. I need to go grocery shopping soon. 4 p.m. — I'm supposed to meet my editing partner at a fast-casual restaurant at 6 p.m. I head there two hours early to look over the piece I'm editing for her and get more NaNoWriMo-ing done. You can't squat without food in front of you, so I order an early dinner: a cup of turkey chili and half of a turkey sandwich. 'Tis the season. It comes to $12.44 with a tip. $12.44 6 p.m. — My editing partner arrives on time; they just order a chai latte. I always feel weird not eating when other people are, so I order one, too. We review each other's chapters and it's pretty productive, but it's also daunting to think about just how much I want to fix in my story. Shop talk somehow delves into a vent session about our childhood/current family relationships/mental illnesses. We wind up talking until it's nearly time for the restaurant to close. This is also productive. $3.99 11 p.m. — Facebook knows me too well! I get a Facebook ad saying that tickets for musical are finally on sale for my city. I've been wanting to see it for ages and it will be in town around my birthday. I buy a ticket right away because I know the good seats will be snapped up quickly. It costs $105.50 but I'm planning to get reimbursed for it; several people can chip in for it as a birthday present to me. $105.50 Daily Total: $5,821.93",1,126
"9 a.m. — Wake up and make pancakes for breakfast per my Saturday tradition. My roommate has a bunch of apples that he wants me to help him eat, so I also eat an apple with peanut butter. Goals for today are to get some cleaning done, get some NaNoWriMo writing done, and go see a movie in the afternoon. I get distracted from cleaning, but my writing is going pretty decently. It's only Day 4 of NaNoWriMo and I am very behind. 1 p.m. — When I manage to make it to 3,350 words, I reward myself with pumpkin pie flavored ice cream I made for a Halloween get-together last week. It was a huge batch, so there's still plenty left. 3 p.m. — I go to a small, local theater to catch a French movie while it is in town for just a few days. I'm not a student, but the woman at the cashier gives me the student discount anyway, so ticket is $8. Huzzah! The movie theater also sells food, so I buy a hot dog and fries for $12. The hot dog is a lot better than I was expecting. $20 6 p.m. — I get back home from the movie. I was tempted to buy a cupcake from the bakery next door to the movie theater, but I guilted myself out of it by thinking of all the ice cream I still have in my freezer that needs to be eaten. I eat a little bit of my ice cream while I try to amp myself up for more writing. Today is my first truly productive day for NaNoWriMo. Something about writing makes me hungry though, so around 10 p.m., I start digging around for food. Nothing in the kitchen looks remotely worth eating … except my roommate's frozen chicken tenders. The bag has been open in the freezer for several weeks, so I don't think he will miss a few of them. I would ask, but he's at work and generally doesn't respond to texts quickly when working. I'm going grocery shopping tomorrow anyway, so I will buy him a new bag to make up for the theft. 12 a.m. — I hit 5,003 words f0r NaNoWriMo. Considering that I started out today with 1,721, I'm pretty pleased with my progress. Daily Total: $20",2,126
"9 a.m. — Pancake, apple, and peanut butter breakfast again for Sunday. Plan today is to get more writing done, do my grocery shopping, and do my laundry. 12 p.m. — Writing isn't going as well this morning. I keep getting distracted by fanfics I want to read. Since I'm not being productive anyway, I decide it's time to run my errands. First stop is pharmacy to drop off my prescriptions. I'm about to run out of testosterone and my surgeon's office gave me a painkiller prescription to fill for recovery. Next, I run across the street for my groceries. I want to keep my meals this week simple because I will be busy with NaNoWriMo. Also, I don't really need a lot of food since I will only be at my apartment until Wednesday evening. I buy: a rotisserie chicken, a bag of apples, baby carrots, a green bell pepper, sweet potatoes, green beans, hummus, three cups of Greek yogurt, a box of protein bars, a block of cheddar cheese, a small box of fancy cookies, a tin of mints, and replacement frozen chicken tenders for my roommate. More than enough for three days of breakfast, lunch, and dinner, as well as some snacks. $37.99 12:40 p.m. — As I'm driving home from the grocery store, the pharmacy calls to say both my prescriptions are ready. Faster than I expected! I turn around and get them. My insurance covered both, so I only have to pay a total co-pay of $8. $8 1 p.m. — Still not feeling the writing. I do meal prep for the next three days instead. I shred up the rotisserie chicken so that I can easily divide it up for meals. I bake and then mash the sweet potatoes. I cut up the green beans and steam them. I sort of nibble on everything a bit while I work, so it ends up being my lunch. While I work, I listen to video essays on YouTube about different films. Hopefully, it'll get my creative juices flowing. 4 p.m. — After puttering around some more and still not getting any writing done, I decide it's laundry time. My apartment doesn't have a laundry machine and I hate going to the laundromat, so every weekend I drive 20 minutes across town to my parents' house to use their washer and dryer. This also gives me an opportunity to pet their cat and, of course, visit with them. 6 p.m. — My dad wants to go out to eat, so we all three go to an inexpensive chain restaurant. I'm in a rare mood for red meat, so I order Salisbury steak, mashed potatoes, and mac and cheese. He never lets me pay for my meals when we go out. 9 p.m. — Get home with my laundry, and I've only written 500 words so far today. Whoops. I procrastinate a while longer to make myself a small fruit and veggie plate to snack on while I write, then I get to work. By the time I go to bed, I manage to make it to just over 6,000 words total, which isn't horrible. Daily Total: $45.99",3,126
"7:30 a.m. — Monday. My alarm goes off at 6 a.m., but I fall back asleep and don't manage to drag myself out of bed until 7:30. Just when I am planning to claim the bathroom, my roommate snags it. I pack up my lunch and snacks for the day while I wait for my turn. Breakfast is just a protein bar; I'll eat a Greek yogurt cup and an apple later at work too. I try to do a little bit of NaNoWriMo-ing, but my brain isn't in gear yet. 9 a.m. — I have an appointment with my therapist before work today. When I started transitioning medically, I needed to get a referral letter from a therapist, so I found a trans-friendly one and got the letter after two meetings. I continue to see him monthly because I find it helpful to vent to a neutral party. Today's session is mostly me complaining about my mom's constant fretting over me getting surgery. She is hoping that I will change my mind. I understand her concerns and have done my best to listen to them patiently, but it has been wearing on my nerves because it seems like she doesn't listen to me in turn. My therapist commiserates with me and I feel a lot better when I'm done venting. He isn't in-network, so I pay for all my appointments out of pocket. Fortunately, he operates on sliding scale, pay-what-you-can model, so it is only $60 for the hour. $60 10:30 a.m. — Finally make it into work. It's gonna be a long day. I eat my yogurt and apple to fuel up. I'm a copywriter for a large company that does web hosting, site building, marketing, and related services for everything from small businesses to international, industrial giants. My job is to write the copy that appears on their sites. 1 p.m. — Suddenly I am starving? I haven't been at work for very long, but I take my lunch break anyway because I'm too focused on my hunger to focus on work. I eat my packed lunch: the chicken, sweet potatoes, and green beans that I prepared on Sunday. I'm still hungry and it's gonna be a long day, so I buy a small cup of soup from the kiosk in my building's cafeteria. $2 3 p.m. — I get a text from Amazon saying that a book I pre-ordered a few weeks ago has shipped. It cost $11.56. Around 5 p.m., I get hungry again. I eat my remaining apple, as well the carrots and hummus that I packed. $11.56 7 p.m. — Finally free. I drive home. There's no traffic, so I kinda zone out and think about my NaNoWriMo project. I have a breakthrough for a scene, so when I get home I immediately open my laptop and type it all out. Dinnertime. I eat the chicken, sweet potatoes, and hummus again. I also eat some of the cookies I bought as my dessert. I spend the rest of the evening messing around online and trying to hit 7,000 words for NaNoWriMo. I top out at 7,043. Daily Total: $73.56",4,126
"6:20 a.m. — Alarm wakes me up. I laze around for a while checking the news and then regretting it. I decide I want a hot breakfast this morning, so I make grits topped with cheese and eat one of my protein bars for good measure. 8:40 a.m. — I spend most of the morning reading, and then remember I have phone calls I wanted to make before I head in to work. First: I need to pay the bill for my wisdom teeth removal. I had all four taken out a couple of months ago and the bill finally arrived this weekend. I was worried about how much it would cost because I already have another big dental bill (nearly a grand) that I am slowly paying down. Fortunately, my insurance covered nearly everything and I only owe $25.20. Next, I need to make a call about taking FMLA and short-term disability for my surgery recovery period. Hopefully, these will only be precautionary measure; I saved up my PTO all year so that I could take off nearly the entire month for recovery on PTO. I ask some questions about some documents I need to send in. I need to scan and email them, but I don't have access to a scanner at my apartment or at work. It will have to wait until Wednesday night, when I will be at my parents' house. $25.20 9:05 a.m. — Finally hit the road only to remember that I need gas. I fill up my tank roughly once a week. Gas prices aren't too terrible here, usually. My best friend recently moved to North Dakota and she says the price is terrible there. $36.82 9:30 a.m. — I didn't pack my lunch today because I didn't want to eat the same meal three times in a row. I have a coupon for a fast-casual restaurant that I like, so I place an order for later in the day. With my discount, it is just $5.66. 1:30 p.m. — I go to pick up the lunch I ordered earlier. It's a chicken gyro and side order of tabbouleh. $5.66 6:20 p.m. — Clock out and drive home. With the change in daylight savings, it is terribly dark outside. I eat my dinner — back to the chicken, sweet potatoes, and green beans. I don't really want to look at the computer screen after writing all day for work, so I busy myself with some small chores around the apartment. Then I shower using the special soap the hospital gave me to prep for surgery. Daily Total: $67.68",5,126
"6 a.m. — I wake up pissed. My mom called last night to tell me that she is getting cold feet about driving me for my surgery. She doesn't think I should get top surgery, but up until now she has always said that if I do it, then she wants to be there for me. Everyone else in the family works, and with my best friend in North Dakota, I'm rather short on options for drivers. I think she will agree to do it in the end, but her indecision is stressing me out — surgery is tomorrow. I decide to do a little bit of retail therapy. I've been meaning to look for a fun 2018 calendar. I shop around a little bit and find one based on an anime character I love. With the yen to USD exchange rate, it is $14.18. $14.18 6:50 a.m. — I want to get out of work early today, so I head in early. Clock in at 7:15 and eat my breakfast at my desk — protein bar and apple. I meant to grab a Greek yogurt cup too, but I forgot it. 1 p.m. — Work lunch is the last of the chicken, sweet potatoes, and green beans. I was working kind of slow before lunch, but I go into hyper-drive now. It's my last day of work before I'm gone for surgery. I won't be back at work until the Monday after Thanksgiving. I want to end on a strong note and make sure there are no open assignments before I leave. 3:45 p.m. — I get out of work. When I get home, I spend a lot of time packing up everything I will need for my recovery. I've bought a lot of stuff in preparation and I also need to consider that I will be away from my apartment for about two weeks. I clean up some before I leave so I won't come home to a huge mess. 5:30 p.m. — I'm finally ready to head to my parents' house. When I get there, my mom acts like she never called me last night and of course she is going to drive me. I'm still sorta mad, but whatever. As long as the surgery happens, I will put up with everything else. 6:30 p.m. — Mom and I go out to a fast food place to grab dinner. I pay for both of us. Dad is still working when we get home and won't be back until tomorrow morning. Around 8 p.m., I eat some rocky road ice cream as a final treat — I won't be able to eat anything after midnight. Mom and I both go to bed around 11:30 p.m. We've got an early morning ahead of us. $13.63 Daily Total: $27.81",6,126
"3 a.m. — We're supposed to check in at the hospital at 6 a.m., so we need to get on the road by 4. I'm not supposed to eat or drink anything because I will be put under general anesthesia. My mouth is really dry though, so I have a very small sip of water. Then, I shower with the special soap and get dressed in loose, comfortable clothes. Finally, it's time to drive out to Gainesville. 8 a.m. — After some waiting around at the hospital, it is finally time. I am rather calm. I feel like I need to be because my mom is panicking so much. Every 20 minutes, she reminds me that I can change my mind and leave at any time. I'm not going to change my mind. I've wanted top surgery for nearly a decade. I paid for the surgery upfront last week, but I'm not sure whether there is a separate bill for the anesthesiologist. I have a follow-up appointment on Monday, so I will ask then. 10:30 a.m. — When I come-to after the surgery, I'm a little agitated. But very quickly, I am completely lucid and can't feel much pain. We stay at the hospital for a while longer for observation and discharge instructions. 1 p.m. — We are back on the road home to Jacksonville. Mom gets sleepy around 2 and stops at a gas station for coffee. She asks if I want anything, but I'm worried about throwing up in the car, so I decline. 4 p.m. — I finally have my first meal of the day: a bowl of cereal. It stays down fine. I'm really not in any pain or nauseated at all, which is a relief. Thank goodness for painkillers. Around 7, Mom makes me grilled cheese and soup for dinner. I'm still feeling well, just sleepy. She is calmer now because the surgery went fine and I'm in such good shape. Hopefully the rest of my recover will go smoothly, and I will be able to go back to work after Thanksgiving as planned.

"7:45 — I guzzle coffee and eat a cheese stick for breakfast. My company works in restaurant consulting, so all of my food is furnished by the chef. It is incredible. I usually give myself license to eat as much as I want between the hours of 9 to 5 under the guide of “intermittent fasting” even though I'm fairly sure that's not how it works. 5:15 — I leave ""early"" to drive to my therapists' office. I'm taking March off alcohol, so I spend most of the time bragging about how good I feel. My therapist probably scrawls “White lady seems to be momentarily over her first world problems” in her notebook after I leave. $20 (from FSA account) Daily Total: $20",1,127
"9:00 a.m. — I use Southwest points to book a trip to Puerto Rico and pay $76 in fees. I'm secretly starting to get into travel hacking, which is a loathsome term for loathsome people, but I am becoming one of them. $76 5:30 p.m. — This is doctor week: I pony up $40 for a dermatologist co-pay (from my FSA) and $11 for parking. I have been meaning to get my skin checked out for a while, so addressing it feels good. $51 8 p.m. — I purchase a ClassPass promotion they're having all month. I recently broke up with my fancy yoga studio and have been deal-hopping on Groupons like a total jerk. Regular weekly exercise keeps me from becoming a depressive alcoholic, so it's worth the money, even when I'm paying full price. $30 Daily Total: $157",2,127
"3 p.m. — I pony up to replace an appliance part that broke while I was in an old apartment. It's technically the landlord's responsibility but he sucks and I don't want my old roommates to remember me as a jerk, so it's on me. $70 5:30 p.m. — I stop at the post office and throw down for international stamps to send Christmas letters to pals in Berlin and Australia. $7 7 p.m. — I stop at Jo-Ann's and buy yarn and knitting needles to keep my sober hands busy. I watch some YouTube videos and clumsily knit a few rows. My cat bats at the yarn ball and I praise her for her brilliance. $13 Daily Total: $90",3,127
"10 a.m. — I receive a call from my pharmacy; the special skin cream prescribed by the derm is experimental and not covered by insurance. I pay for the cream out of my FSA and put $5 on a credit card for shipping. $89 7 p.m. — I go to a spin class via ClassPass after work and it's really really hard, but I feel very proud of myself afterwards. The screen in front shows our ranking: It turns out I'm a competitive maniac who will probably end up near the top but entirely alone. 9 p.m. — I get home and buy two books I'll probably never read on Amazon. They'll actually ship the next day. $15 Daily Total: $104",4,127
"7:45 a.m. — Coffee at work. Today's food struggle involves testing burgers. I'm in heaven. I'm also very, very full. 2 p.m. — I book the Puerto Rico rental car because my boyfriend used his points on my return flight. I don't live with him, I'm pretty sure I out-earn him, and he is unbearably frugal in a ""don't turn up the thermostat — just hands me a third sweater"" kind of way. My prince! $172 7 p.m. — I fill up my car with gas. I only do this once a month, since I drive my car little old lady style to work, home, and therapy. I usually try to buy gas in the suburbs, since gas is cheaper there than in the city, but I missed my chance on Monday. $29 Daily Total: $201",5,127
"11 a.m. — Day off! A yoga studio I've gone to a few times has a free community class on Saturdays, so I try to make it as often as possible to stretch out my ClassPass. I donate $2 which I know makes me seem miserly, but they don't really solicit anything! I'm the only one who donates, I notice. $2 6 p.m. — I go to a friend's house for dinner and she's made chili. I contribute a bouquet of fresh flowers for $9, since I'm not bringing any alcohol. I take the train there and back on my Ventra card. $9 11 p.m. — I meet up with my friends at a bar and am charged $1 for seltzer water. I'm energized from my nap and walk the half hour there and back, in an unseasonably warm winter. $1 Daily Total: $12",6,127
"12 p.m. — Laundry day! I secretly love this chore. Sorting and hang-drying and turning things inside out and folding are very soothing, and having a clean stack of clothes is so satisfying. I pay $7 for two huge washers (drying is free dryers) — and then $4 for a ginormous scoop of peanut butter chocolate ice cream at the joint next door to the laundromat. $11 4 p.m. — I attend my first barre class via ClassPass, and I'm not sure it's for me. I should probably give it another shot, but I feel kind of dumb sitting against the wall pressing a tiny red rubber ball into a pole. There was a moment when I made eye contact with my reflection and wondered what my purpose was on this earth. Barre feels dated to me already, like Jazzercise or NordicTrack. 6 p.m. — I pick up two pairs of clean, re-soled shoes from the cobbler and bleed out more money. This is about what they cost new, but neither pair is being made anymore and they were in bad shape after the winter. I pat myself on the back for not throwing them in a landfill, but the price tag still stings. $110 Daily Total: $121",7,127
"6:20 a.m. — I'm up a little earlier than usual today because I need to drive my fiancé to work by 7 a.m. He's a freelance audio engineer, and sometimes I have to drive him to work if the gig is too far to ride his bike to. (He has a motorcycle but it's currently out for repairs.) This gig is a three-day job out of town and I'll have the car to myself for the next few days. He makes us some coffee and I take mine in a travel mug. 7:30 a.m. — I'm back home and hungry; I avoid the strong temptation to pick myself up some breakfast tacos after dropping off my fiancé and I eat a bowl of cereal instead. I'm planning on doing some grocery shopping after work, so I try to make a mental note of what I need as I walk around the kitchen with my cereal. My fiancé and I adopted a kitten a few months ago, and the kitten got a taste of milk one time and now tries to shove his face into our cereal bowls every day, so this morning I am dealing with it by just keeping the bowl out of his tongue range. 10:30 a.m. — I've been working on a really boring word-processing project at work and I can't stop yawning. I'm trying to cut back on office coffee, so I guzzle a bunch of water and take a break to stretch instead. 12:30 p.m. — I have to pick up a couple of packages that were dropped off at a UPS holding station on the UT campus. I feed the street meter 50 cents. The pickup goes a lot smoother than I expected it would, and I have time to grab something to eat. There's a Chipotle right next door, and though I know it is a mortal sin to choose Chipotle over the surfeit of cheap, delicious Mexican food options available in Austin, I'm starving and I need to move quickly. I order a sofritas bowl, pay with the last bit of cash I have left over from a babysitting job a few days ago, and hustle back to my car. I pull into work with several minutes of break time to spare and chow down at my desk. $7.50 2 p.m. — The taste of Chipotle salsa lingers in my mouth. I find a piece of Dubble Bubble gum in my purse  — I honestly do not know how it got there — and chew it for the five or so minutes the flavor lasts. 5:40 p.m. — I get home and eagerly rip open the two packages I picked up earlier. I had an intense babysitting gig last week, and used the money I made to treat myself to a couple pairs of new shoes. I'd been alternating between one pair of boots and one pair of clogs for the past six months, so I bought some comfy-looking flats and a pair of casual sneakers in anticipation of spring/summer. I'm disappointed to find that neither pair of shoes fits perfectly. I returning things, so I decide to sleep on it, try the shoes on again tomorrow, and then decide what to do. 6 p.m. — It's a cool evening and the sun's still up, so I decide to go for a run. I had started off the new year exercising pretty regularly, but fell off hard once I started my new job. A few minutes in, I start to feel some pain in my knees, so I take it easy and drop to a brisk walk every so often. Once it gets warmer, I think I'm going to get a membership to the Barton Springs Pool so I can switch to swimming instead of running and save my fragile knees. 7 p.m. — I walk to the grocery store a few blocks away. I buy pasta, chicken, asparagus, grape tomatoes, a bag of pre-cut cauliflower bits, broth, granola, yogurt, pineapple, eggs, and, because I'm ravenously hungry, a bag of popcorn that I can start eating on the walk back home. $33 8:30 p.m. — I finish cooking a huge batch of pasta with chicken, asparagus, tomatoes, and some garlic and parmesan cheese I already had at home. I have enough left over to last me at least three more meals, and as soon as I finish my dinner portion, I pack the rest up into smaller Tupperware containers so I can grab and go. “Meal prep” is a relatively new concept for me, having previously lived in a city where I had a much bigger food budget and the ability to have anything delivered at any time. 9 p.m. — I turn down my roommate's offer of a gin and tonic and crack open a mineral water instead. My plan for the night is to take a shower, apply a face mask, and catch up on the shitty CW teen dramas that I only watch when I'm alone. Daily Total: $40.50",1,128
"7 a.m. — I let myself sleep 15 minutes late since I showered last night. I make coffee and eat yogurt with granola for breakfast, and pack leftover pasta, popcorn, pineapple, and chocolate-covered pomegranate seeds for lunch and snacking at work. This day is brought to you by the letter , I guess. I have therapy right after work tonight and I like to make sure I eat a little something beforehand so I'm not hangry. 8 a.m. — I try on my new shoes again and decide to suck it up and exchange the sneakers for a smaller size. Back into the box they go. I'll wear the flats today. Breaking them in is the worst part, and I might as well get started on it. 10 a.m. — So tired. The switch to an 8:30 - 5:30 desk job hasn't been as easy for me as I'd hoped. I start snacking on chocolate-covered pomegranate seeds just to stay awake. 11:30 a.m. — I print out a return label and bring the shoes to a UPS shipping center for a free return. On the drive back to work, I see so many places that I want to buy lunch from, but I return to the office and heat up my leftovers like a good girl. 6 p.m. — After what feels like a very long day, I head to therapy. My therapist lets me know as our hour is wrapping up that she'll be leaving the counseling center in a few months, so I can start thinking about what I want my next move to be with therapy. I've been holding onto a psychiatrist's number that my friend gave me months ago, and now that I have health insurance, I think I might make an appointment with her. Seeing a psychiatrist and discussing possible medication options would be a huge step for me, but I've made so much progress in taking care of my mental health in the past year that I think it's a step I'm ready to take. My therapist nearly forgets to charge me as I'm on my way out, but I remind her, because I'm a nerd. $20 7:15 p.m. — I'm home and hungry. I still have so much pasta left, and a strong sense of duty not to waste it, so I heat some up for dinner. I'm feeling a little achy and I want to get a good night's sleep, so for dessert, I pull out a bag of gummy candies that some friends from California gave us for Christmas. (The special kind of gummies you can only get in a few states, if you catch my drift.) I eat one and settle in with some old episodes of , and within an hour, I am feeling chill.

"6:45 a.m. — My alarm goes off and I need to shower this morning, so I get up right away. I was too lazy for makeup yesterday, but I guess I'm inspired by RuPaul or something, because today, after drinking my coffee, I spend extra time crafting a bright blue eyeshadow . I don't leave time for breakfast, though, so I throw a yogurt into my bag to eat once I get to work. 8:30 a.m. — Eating yogurt at my desk and looking at pictures of plants on Instagram. I really want to buy some new houseplants, but I'm going to wait until I complete a dog-sitting gig in a few weeks. I try to use dog and babysitting gigs to pay for ""nonessential"" purchases as often as possible. 11:45 a.m. — I signed up for a membership at a new gym across the street from my old job a couple months ago, then canceled my membership once I realized I definitely couldn't afford it after the special introductory offer period ended. I log in to my online banking account and see that I've been charged the full price, even though I canceled my membership last month. I call the studio and it takes them a minute to find the cancelation paperwork I filled out, but the person I speak to assures me that I should be able to get a refund. I'll just have to wait until the manager gets in. $99 12 p.m. — My boss asks me to pick up lunch for her, so I take her credit card to a nearby sandwich shop. I really want to buy something for myself, too. I'm so tired of eating this pasta. 12:30 p.m. — Someone from the gym calls me back. Unfortunately, because I canceled my membership mid-billing cycle, they charged me for this month and can't refund me. The person I speak to tells me that I'm welcome to use their facilities until the end of this billing cycle. Part of me is like, , but another part of me is like, I didn't like the vibe of the gym at all, either, so I've pretty much just thrown away $99. Financial lesson learned: Always read the fine print on any contract you sign, don't be afraid to ask clarifying questions about that fine print, and don't sign any contract just because person pitching it to you seems like a nice lady and you just want to make her happy. 2:30 p.m. — After a mostly slow week at work, I get slammed with four projects right after lunch. I cave on my pledge to cut back on office coffee and make myself a K-cup of hot, sugary chemicals to enjoy while I dive into a long report. 6 p.m. — I come home to my fiancé (he got a ride back to our house from a coworker) and freshly baked chocolate chip cookies. I have two cookies and a bit of bourbon, and we listen to a new record he got in the mail today. 8 p.m. — We're hungry but aren't really in the mood to go out. We get a couple of personal pizzas to go from a place nearby. It's a little hectic in the pizza place and I want to GTFO ASAP, so I pay for both pizzas and my fiancé thanks me. $18 9 p.m. — Our roommate invites us to go to a bar with him and a friend, but we're both pooped. I wash my face, the official signal that I'm in for the night, and my fiancé and I are in bed and asleep around 10 p.m. Daily Total: $117",3,128
"7 a.m. — My fiancé usually wakes up early on Saturdays to prepare for his slot co-hosting a show on the local radio station. I get up with him, feeling well-rested after turning in so early. We drink coffee, listen to music, and play with the cat until he leaves. 8:45 a.m. — My fiancé sends me a picture of a huge bucket of doughnuts that were dropped off at the radio station. I don't ask him to bring one home for me, but I'm gonna keep holding off on breakfast in the hope that he does. 9:30 a.m. — The radio station is doing their annual pledge drive and haven't had anyone call in with a donation yet today, so I call in and give $20 to get the ball rolling. $20 12 p.m. — Once my fiancé gets back home, we spend nearly an hour looking for a car key that the cat swatted off a table. After searching and cleaning almost every surface in the house, my fiancé moves the refrigerator and finds the key. Of course. I eat a handful of chocolate chips to celebrate (and make up for the doughnuts he didn't bring home). 2 p.m. — My fiancé and our roommate have been working on a project for the past hour or so while I read the news and scream softly into my hands, and we're all getting hungry. My fiancé asks me if I'd be down to pick up lunch if he pays for it. It's raining pretty hard, but a free lunch seems worth it, so I make a trip for soup and sandwiches. The bartender there asks me if I'd like to take a shot of whiskey with him, but I'm like, 3 p.m. — I hear from two friends offering potential plans for today, though at this point, with this weather, I feel inclined to stay wrapped in a blanket for as long as possible. One of my girlfriends wants to go to the mall to pick out an outfit for an upcoming event, and another acquaintance from New York tells me he's in town and going out with some of his rock climbing buddies tonight if I'd like to tag along. I don't know if I'd quite fit in with a gaggle of gay rock climbers, but it sounds like a good time. 4:30 p.m. — My friend tells me she's ready to go shopping, so I pick her up and head to the mall. Nothing at H&M really piques her interest, so I suggest we drive down a street with a lot of thrift and vintage stores and pop into a few to see if she can find anything. (This is also because I kind of want to go thrifting.) Unfortunately, she's just getting over an illness and starts to feel nauseous again, so I pull into a gas station. Their bathroom is closed, and she gets sick in the parking lot. I buy her a bottle of water before driving her home. $1 7 p.m. — My fiancé is making steak tacos for dinner and already bought the ingredients while I was out. I make myself a little cocktail with soda, gin, and St. Germain (the liquor store down the block had a great sale last weekend, so we stocked up) and help him prep. 8 p.m. — My fiancé has been complaining about his neck, which he hurt at work. I fashion him a makeshift heating pad by filling a thin sock with rice and a little bit of lavender oil. 8:45 p.m. — His neck is already feeling better and it's dinner time! Our roommate makes us mezcal cocktails as thanks for preparing dinner. 10 p.m. — The rain is torrential at this point, and I decide I'm really not in the mood to go out. My fiancé and I catch up on some TV and are in bed by midnight. (Sorry, rock climbers!) Daily Total: $21",4,128
"8 a.m. — We wake up, grab the newspaper from outside, and spend some time reading and drinking coffee. I have a couple of chocolate chip cookies with my coffee. 9:30 a.m. — Our roommate needs to use up some of his veggies, so he makes breakfast tacos with eggs, broccolini, and mushrooms, and gives me one. I eat 3/4 of mine and give the rest to my fiancé. (The coffee and cookies are already doing some unholy alchemy in my stomach.) 11 a.m. — The rain stops! I have some indoor activities planned for the day, but I decide to make myself go running first. 11:20 a.m. — So much for that. My allergies are acting up, so I bring things back inside, where I can sneeze all over myself in the privacy of my own home. 1:30 p.m. — I remember that I have cauliflower bits in the refrigerator and tomatoes to finish, so I throw together some spicy fried cauliflower rice for lunch. 3 p.m. — I split a spliff with my fiancé and our roommate and work on some macrame. I run out of the hemp cord I started a wall hanging with, so I try to re-order some on Amazon, but it's an Add-On item, and I'm too high to deal with Amazon's shit right now. I just keep it in my cart and tell myself I'll come back to it tomorrow. 4:30 p.m. — Aaaaand it's nap time. 5:30 p.m. — My fiancé and I wake up and he immediately asks what's for dinner. He says he's craving Cuban food, so we drive to a little Cuban cafe tucked away in a shopping center and order sandwiches, congri, and guava pastries to bring home. He pays. He just got a raise at work and worked overtime last week, so he's being a little more treat-y than usual. 6:30 p.m. — After stuffing ourselves, we settle in to watch a movie. My fiancé has been trying to work his way through a list of the 1,000 Greatest Films of All Time, and tonight's selection is #266, Kurosawa's . 9 p.m. — Despite our nap earlier, we are pooped. This is the first weekend in months that we both have off, so we might have chilled a little too hard. I try not to feel guilty about getting some rest. We have some trips coming up in the next few months that we need to save up for, so the hustle will resume soon. We give each other butt massages (#romance) and I play Text Twist on my laptop until 11 p.m. Daily Total: $0",5,128
"7 a.m. — We're out of the milk that I usually put in my coffee, so I decide to wait until I get to the office to get caffeinated. I eat yogurt and granola and watch the cat chase down a bug that ran out of our closet. (Ah, springtime in Austin!) 8:30 a.m. — I have to pull double duty as the main receptionist this week at work, but the temp receptionist who was here last week left a bunch of Hershey's kisses on the front desk, which sweetens the deal. 1 p.m. — I head home for my lunch break. My fiancé went grocery shopping, so I make a sandwich. It's been an intense day at work so far and it's nice to come home for some kitten kisses. 4 p.m. — I remember that I have macrame supplies in my Amazon cart. I need to add a bunch of stuff to make the minimum, but then I end up going way over it. The Add-On Item racket strikes again! At least I won't have to buy any more supplies for a while, and this might encourage me to actually put more time into this hobby so that I can make stuff that's good enough to sell. $44 4:3o p.m. — After dropping that chunk of change, I'm feeling bad about not standing my ground against the gym that wouldn't refund me. I know I should have been firmer about needing a refund the last time I spoke to them, but I can be a total pushover about that sort of thing — after all, it was my mistake. It just would have been nice to spend that refund on an activity I actually want to do. I've been really anxious about my savings lately because I wrecked it with this move and it's going to take a long time to get it back to a comfortable place. Then I remember that I haven't done my taxes yet, and since I made $60,000 less in 2016 than I did in 2015 (ouch, I know), there's a chance I'll get a decent refund. Well, here's to making a bunch of huge, life-changing choices right before you turn 30! 6 p.m. — My fiancé made spicy pan-fried noodles with shrimp for dinner, and there's enough left over to take to work tomorrow! My re-sized sneakers came in the mail and they feel pretty good. 6:30 p.m. — I think I'm finally ready to start my taxes. I'm still missing a W-2 from a part-time serving job, which was the only document sent to my old address, even though I signed up for mail forwarding. I contact the company manager to make sure she has my new address in case the W-2 got sent back to her. I fill in the rest for now. 7:30 p.m. — Blergh, that's enough taxes for tonight. I still have more than a month before they're due, so this is technically not procrastination. 8:30 p.m. — My fiancé comes back from a meeting at the radio station with a bag of peanut butter and chocolate popcorn. I eat a little bit and we watch , a movie that's been sitting around on his hard drive for months. I shower, do some reading, and go to sleep around midnight. Daily Total: $44",6,128
"7 a.m. — I make eggs and cheese on toast for breakfast — and coffee. 11:45 a.m. — Two coworkers who have never really spoken to me before invite me to go to lunch with them. I can't take my break until my supervisor gets out of a meeting she's in, plus I brought in those leftover noodles, so I decline their offer but thank them for thinking of me. 1:30 p.m. — I venture to HomeGoods on my break. I have $20 left on a gift card that my aunt gave me months ago, and although I don't love HomeGoods the store, I love home goods in general. I buy an ice cube tray, sea salt, and two sets of coasters, because I can't decide which ones I like better and we're having a dinner party later this week anyway. I pay the $2.25 difference with the last dollar and change I have in my wallet. $22.25 6 p.m. — It's my turn to choose what's for dinner ... and I choose not cooking! It's Taco Tuesday at the local fish market and my fiancé's motorcycle is up and running again, so we ride over there. I buy us four enormous fish tacos, two draught beers, and tip $4. $20 7 p.m. — My fiancé wants to get frozen yogurt for dessert, so we ride over to the fro-yo spot near our house. I'm a little chilly from being on the bike, so I splurge on some hot fudge, but he pays anyway. 8 p.m. — My fiancé plays the guitar for a bit while I do some writing. We're going to try to get another movie in tonight, but I have a feeling I won't be able to stay awake for the whole thing. Daily Total: $42.25",7,128
"7 a.m. — I refill my weekly MetroCard before heading to work. $31 8 a.m. — I get to the hospital where we have a Starbucks onsite. I order a grande iced coffee and then go to the cafeteria for tater tots with sausage. I would save a lot more money if I didn't spend so much on food. I almost never cook — I really hate it — so I eat out for breakfast, lunch and dinner. $6 12 p.m. — I go to the hospital cafeteria and buy a really decent-sized salad for lunch, and I get 15% off because I am an employee. I'm trying to eat healthier and go for salads at least three times a week. $4.40 5 p.m. — I head to my dermatology appointment on the Upper West Side. I have pretty nasty eczema out of nowhere and it's driving me insane. My insurance covers me 100%, no copay. 8 p.m. — Finally home after my derm appointment. I have an allergy test on my back and have to go back in two days to remove it. I spend some time with my son and make him a sandwich for dinner. We cuddle a little bit before bed. Daily Total: $41.40",1,129
"6:20 a.m. — My alarm goes off. I stay in bed for a little bit and browse through Amazon. Prime is legit a lifesaver. I order some cups for my son and new tweezers because I have no idea where I put mine. I jump in the shower and then get my son ready. After I drop him off at school, I head to work. $20 8 a.m. — I go to the hospital cafeteria and order breakfast and a coffee from Starbucks. I use my discount and then head upstairs to my room. $6 12 p.m. — I'm feeling lazy and decide not to walk to the other side of the hospital for my salad. Instead, I go to my regular café and get a ham and cheese whole-wheat wrap. I have water upstairs, so I don't need to spend money on a beverage. During the week, I only drink water and coffee, no juice or soda. $5.40 5:30 p.m. — I make it home from work and call my boyfriend. We usually see each other twice a week, so we chat for a bit and make plans to see each other tomorrow. I make dinner for my son — mac and cheese and a glass of milk — and we watch on our Amazon Fire stick. (Thanks, babe.) 8 p.m. — It's time for bed. Daily Total: $31.40",2,129
"6:30 a.m. — I snoozed this morning so I'm rushing to get my son ready for school. I don't have to worry about breakfast for him because his school provides free breakfast. He eats waffles or cereal once he gets there at 7:30. 8 a.m. — I go to Starbucks and have a medium iced coffee and sausage with corned beef hash. $6.00 1 p.m. — I take lunch a little later since a coworker brought me another coffee around 11 a.m. I walk over to the other hospital building and buy a crispy chicken salad. $4.40 5 p.m. — I get to my dermatology follow-up appointment. She checks the allergy test (apparently, I'm allergic to nickel) and gives me suggestions for a new body wash and soap to use. I make a mental note to stop by Duane Reade during lunch tomorrow to pick them up. 6:30 p.m. — I'm really lucky to live with my aunt; she's amazing. She picks up my son from school and feeds him once they're home, usually rice and chicken. Once I get home, I make him a ham and cheese sandwich and we cuddle and watch until bedtime. I make myself a tuna sandwich before bed. 8 p.m. — I take a Lyft to and from my boyfriend's house; he lives in the Bronx, about 20 minutes away from me. We catch up on and cuddle. I almost always pay for my own cabs because I make more money than he does, but when we go out for date night (usually once a week, instead of staying in) he picks up the tab. I leave around midnight and climb into bed when I get home. I'm going to be so tired tomorrow. $40 Daily Total: $50.40",3,129
"6:50 a.m. — I'm so tired! I snooze three times and then force myself to jump out of bed. My son is truly the best kid ever. He's a morning person and never gives me any issues getting him up. I'm blessed! I vividly remember giving my own mother hell every morning before school. 8 a.m. — I have my usual coffee and breakfast at the cafe. I get a cold brew today because it's a little stronger and I feel like a zombie. $6 12 p.m. — I head to Duane Reade before getting lunch. I pick up Aveeno Skin Relief body wash, Aveeno lotion, and a small cocoa butter stick for a nasty pimple I had last week. I apply this at night before bed and it helps with the scar. I also pick up a new shower sponge. $30 12:30 p.m. — I get a crispy chicken salad, grab some water from the cooler, and eat at my desk on break while watching last night's episode. $4.40 5 p.m. — I go to the beauty salon after work; it's a weekly expense for me. A wash-and-set is $20, plus tip. $25 7:30 a.m. — I go to the supermarket before heading home and do some food shopping for my son. I buy ham, cheese, bread, mac and cheese, milk, juice, cake, and some fruit snacks. $30 8 p.m. — I put the groceries away and call my boyfriend. We chat for a bit and try to decide on Friday night plans while I make my son dinner. I put my son to bed and climb into bed to watch before I go to sleep. Daily Total: $95.40",4,129
"6:25 a.m. — I don't hit snooze today! I get up and get us ready for the day. My aunt is awake and makes coffee before I leave. I give my son $2 before I drop him off, in case he wants chips after school. $2 8 a.m. — I skip having a big breakfast today and grab coffee and a banana at Starbucks. I don't feel like eating. $3 1 p.m. — I meet an old coworker from my previous job at the hospital for lunch. We go to a Mexican place around the hospital and get burritos and and one margarita each. I pick up the tab. $45 8 p.m. — My boyfriend picks me up and we decide to go see ; he pays. We head to his house after and go to sleep since the movie ran pretty late. Daily Total: $50",5,129
"11 a.m. — I wake up at my boyfriend's. We cuddle for a bit and then I take a cab home. I really wish he would offer to pay... $20 12 p.m. — I arrive home and spend the afternoon with my son. Later, we head over to my mom's for lunch and chill there for a bit. 4 p.m. — I take my son to see the new movie. I buy him chicken tenders and a slushy at the movies. He loves the movie, but falls asleep while it's playing. $40 7 p.m. — We're home from the movies and spend the rest of the day in bed watching TV until bedtime. Daily Total: $60",6,129
"9:30 a.m. — My son goes with his dad to his grandparents' house every Sunday, so I usually spend the day at home in bed or doing chores. I get him ready and his dad picks him up at 10 a.m. 12 p.m. — My mom brings me food, bless her heart. I'm in bed catching up on shows from the week. I try and do the bare minimum on Sundays. 6 p.m. — My son is back. I order Chinese food and look over his homework before bedtime. I also iron his uniform for school and my slacks and blouse for work on Monday. $12 Daily Total: $12",7,129
"8:35 a.m. — I wake up a bit late since I took a six hour bus ride from Copenhagen to Berlin yesterday and then did an at-home workout once I reached my apartment. I stocked up on groceries in Denmark, so this morning I have some organic oats with chocolate-banana protein powder and peanut butter. I make a cup of instant coffee with a splash of my roommate's milk — something she would crucify me for if she saw, but luckily she's asleep. 9:30 a.m. — I walk to the U-Bahn station right outside my house. Not even gonna lie: I fare skip a lot of the time. (German stations don't have turnstiles and my job doesn't reimburse me for transportation.) I would feel terrible about it...except 90% of people I've talked to in Berlin do the same. The train arrives right as I reach the bottom of the stairs, so I bolt toward the door. No fare checker today, thank god. 11:18 a.m. — I'm starving already, so I have a cup of coffee and a huge orange with some walnuts and cinnamon from our company kitchen. We're a nutrition and fitness company, so raw nuts and fruit are always in excess around here. 12 p.m. — I recently returned from a monthlong work trip where I had gym access 24/7, so I've gotten more serious about weightlifting and cardio and want to find a good — and cheap — gym. Luckily, a music club-slash-gym just opened around the corner from work. I duck in and it turns out they have a free week trial membership! I sign up, peek around the weight room, and make a plan to do a legs circuit after work. 12:30 p.m. — I didn't have time to grocery shop when I got home last night and everything is closed in Berlin on Sundays, so I stop into a discount grocery store to pick up snacks. Turns out they have a salad bar that's .99 Euro per 100 grams! I load up on fresh-ish veggies and get a big piece of roasted chicken. Very pleased with my thriftiness. $5.20 12:45 p.m. — I grab a soy cardamom latte at a vegan food stand before heading back to work. Despite being spring, it's still freezing out and I need a warm pick-me-up. I'm from California and justify a lot of my coffee orders with this logic. $3.20 1:20 p.m. — The yoga leggings I ordered over two months ago have finally arrived. They were a birthday present to myself and were on sale, but a shipping snafu made me wonder if I'd ever see them in real life. Luckily, they fit like a glove! I also get a notification for another delivery. I assume it's a replacement order from the athletic wear company and make a mental note to collect and then return that package on Saturday. 2:50 p.m. — Still hungry. Am lusting after vegan cookies from the food stand outside but I stick to an office apple instead. 4 p.m. — I cave and get a vegan cookie. $2.13 6:45 p.m. — I head to the gym after work and start the first day of my weeklong free trial. 8 p.m. — I do the responsible thing and actually purchase my U-Bahn ticket home today, then head straight to the grocery store. $2.88 8:45 p.m. — I leave the grocery store with a week's worth of lunch and dinner essentials: spinach, soy milk, eggs, soy meat, zucchinis, sweet potatoes, frozen strawberries, garbanzo beans, tuna, and a protein bar because I'm starving post-workout and feel like I'll perish on the one block walk home. $31.49 9:30 p.m. — Make a healthy dinner with some new groceries while I watch Netflix and text my girlfriend. We're heading to London for vacation in a week and a half and are still planning logistics. After, I take a shower, pack my gym bag, and paint my nails. I've packed a salad for tomorrow's lunch and plan on hitting the gym early tomorrow because I have after-work plans. Drift off at about midnight. Daily Total: $44.90",1,130
"7:15 a.m. — Wake up and make protein oats with peanut butter and coffee with soy from groceries at home, then clean my house a bit since my friend is coming for a last-minute visit from London tonight. I head out the door for the gym at 8:30. 10 a.m. — I'm dreading work today so I grab a soy iced flat white at the cafe near my office. I use the office fruit and nuts to make a quick post-workout snack and get to work. $3.20 12 p.m. — I brought lunch today: spinach and lamb lettuce with a can of tuna plus some stir fried zucchini and sweet potato. I'm still starving four hours after my workout, so I eat lunch as soon as possible. I have another coffee with soy, this time from the office machine. 4 p.m. — It's midday snack time and I'm starving after picking at some leftover walnuts. I head to Lidl, a super discounted grocery store nearby my office, and grab a cheese pretzel stick and some skyr. $2.11 6:45 p.m. — My friend arrives after a long detour from London to Berlin and it turns out the concert we were on the guest list for is canceled. I take her out to Burgermeister, Germany's answer to In-n-Out, and get us tofu burgers with fries before we head home to crash and relax. $14.88 Daily Total: $20.19",2,130
"8:30 a.m. — I eat my typical protein oats and instant coffee at home before I leave for work with a packed lunch. (The same one as yesterday.) My friend's still half asleep but we agree to meet later in the day for vegan donuts. 10 a.m. — I buy an iced Americano at the coffee bar near my office because it's Hump Day. $2.88 2 p.m. — After eating my packed lunch, my friend meets me at a bakery near work and we each get 2 vegan donuts. She offers to pay since I covered dinner last night, so I save $4.78. 7:20 p.m. — I meet my friend at Central Station since she's about to catch a plane back to London. (She was only staying one night for the concert that was canceled.) I'm starving and had the longest day at work, so I grab a cheese pretzel on the platform. $1.20 7:45 p.m. — I top up a travel card for the U-Bahn (I had an extra pass this morning so it was free), and then head home to cook dinner and watch . $7.51 Daily Total: $11.59",3,130
"7:15 a.m. — I wake up early with the intention of hitting the gym but laze around in bed with coffee and oatmeal before doing a quick cardio session at home. After, I head to work on the U-Bahn using the card I bought yesterday. 10 a.m. — I grab a soy cardamom latte from the vegan cafe by work since it's gonna be another long day. I've frozen some sliced banana at work so I munch on that as I get to work. $3.21 12 p.m. — I'm inundated with emails and projects today, so I eat my packed lunch while I work. Today's grub: lamb's lettuce, stir-fried zucchini and sweet potato, garbanzo beans, and a can of tuna. I have an office coffee with soy milk because I'm already down for a nap. 2 p.m. — I'm having a massive sugar craving before my meeting so I run out to the same vegan cafe and grab a chocolate cookie then dash back inside to continue what feels like the longest day ever. $2.70 6:45 p.m. — I head to the gym where it turns out that my ""free week pass"" is only good for three days. I'm annoyed but decide to cough up the initiation and monthly membership fees since it's close to work and has almost all the equipment I need. The monthly fee from here on out is $21.50 so overall it's still a bargain. $59.26 8 p.m. — After a long gym session, I take the U-Bahn home and actually pay this time. Believe it or not, it's actually cheaper to get the monthly pass. Paying almost every day is annoying but at least I have time on the way home. $2.91 8:30 p.m. — I reheat some stir-fried zucchini, garbanzo beans, sweet potato, and add two eggs. I snack on some strawberries with peanut butter and soy milk for ""dessert"" before heading to bed. Daily Total: $68.08",4,130
"10 a.m. — I have breakfast at home then head to the office, picking up an iced Americano with soy along the way. On my second coffee of the day with more to come, but it's Friday! $3.23 12:50 p.m. — We have office lunches on Fridays, meaning I get to skip another prepped meal and save some groceries for later in the week. 1:50 p.m. — I buy a new gym guide since I'm getting into weightlifting. It's super cheap and most ones are crazy expensive so why not? $4.65 4:00 p.m. — I have an office snack consisting of my leftover skyr, walnuts, and some chocolate cherry oats. 8:30 p.m. — Arrive home after a gym session. I still have groceries left, so I go with the same dinner: stir-fried veggies with eggs and a a protein shake. I'm craving chocolate and there's a bodega next door with Milka Oreo so I venture out to grab one. I take a bubble bath, watch Netflix, and fall asleep at 10 p.m. like the grandma I am. $1.40 Daily Total: $9.28",5,130
"10:10 a.m. — I wake up late and have protein oats with peanut butter and coffee for breakfast. My girlfriend and I text while I survey my mess of a room. I have to move out in two weeks and am still sorting out the details, but right now, my main priority is getting my $760 deposit back. I make a mental note to figure out where to find cheap boxes in the next few days. 12:45 p.m. — I head out to go see the new apartment in a suburb pretty far out of town. I'm still feeling groggy and a bit hungry so I grab an iced Americano and a breakfast sandwich from the Starbucks nearby. $6.94 1 p.m. — I buy roundtrip tickets to and from the suburb. Then I promptly get on the wrong train and have to call the landlord to tell him I'll be way late to see the room. Arrrghhhhh. $6.67 4:45 — After I'm done seeing the apartment, I take a bus to the biggest nearby station. It turns out that there's a 30-minute wait until the next train to Alexanderplatz comes, so I get a Subway salad, a cookie, some chips and a caramel latte from Dunkin' Donuts while I wait on the platform. The apartment was nice and roomy, but the suburb is about an hourlong commute from work and the building has a super-strict policy on guests staying overnight. My girlfriend likes to come for a week at a time when she has university breaks so we can spend quality time together. This seems like a no-go. $12.62 6:40 p.m. — I peek into the neighborhood Lululemon on my way home and try on excessively overpriced leggings. None of them are actually that flattering on me, but a nice sports bra is on sale for $40 and I'm in need. I'm tempted but I'm also broke until my next paycheck so I pass and feebly lie to the attentive saleswoman about coming back later to buy some $180 tights. 7:30 p.m. — Same dinner as all last week, plus a protein shake. I use up what's left of my groceries and remember that basically all grocery stores will be closed tomorrow so I need to make it to mine before 10 p.m. I also need to switch things up so I don't get ridiculously bored with the same recipes next week. I munch on some strawberries with soy milk while watching to procrastinate on getting out of my warm bed. 8:55 p.m. — I mournfully put on pants and go back out for a last-minute grocery haul. I get pretty much the same thing but switch up the vegetables a little: zucchini, canned white beans, tuna, red peppers, pre-cooked chicken, soy ""ground beef,"" and a chocolate bar with dried fruit and nuts because I want more sweets. I head home, unpack my groceries, and organize a few things for the move before hitting the sack. $20.17 Daily Total: $46.40",6,130
"11 a.m. — I sleep in and then make my typical breakfast while scrolling through housing ads on WG, Berlin's answer to Craigslist for apartments. (Craigslist is available in Berlin but almost every housing listing is a scam.) My current landlord has turned out to be pretty conniving, so I'm really worried about getting my deposit back in time to move. Not having savings sucks and was a significant drawback to moving here, but I figure out ways to make it work. 2 p.m. — Have a quick pre-workout protein shake then head to the gym for a 2 hour weights and interval training session. I'm trying to get stronger while also keeping my metabolism in good shape, so I end up spending a lot more time at the gym than most people. I use the new guide I bought on Friday to do a back/biceps workout and am demolished by the end of it. 5 p.m. — I make myself a huge salad with tuna and beans while also sautéing and boiling veggies for the rest of the week. I FaceTime my girlfriend and we chat about summer housing options. It looks like she'll be moving to Berlin for a summer practicum — ! — and we definitely want to try living together for those three months. This means I'll most likely need to look for a more expensive studio apartment from June through September. (Leases run very short here.) I decide that I'll Airbnb for the next month until she has confirmed all of her practicum details and can help pay half of the deposit on a new place for the summer. 9 p.m. — I get hungry a bit later and I snack on leftover strawberries while I pack up everything I possibly can. My roommate is extremely neurotic about cleaning so I spend an hour or so cleaning the kitchen, then another 45 minutes on our tiny bathroom. I plan on doing a full sweep of everything every day after work this week. That means getting up super-early for gym time, but it's all worth it though. Next week I'll be leaving for my London vacation. Daily Total: $0",7,130
"8 a.m. — I haven't been sleeping well since the inauguration and feel like a zombie. I decide I need coffee, but instead of buying my favorite $5 dirty chai, I go to Trader Joe's for a free mini cup. I haven't eaten breakfast yet, so I pick up two Greek yogurts, a banana, and an orange. $2.76 11 a.m. — My dermatologist's office left me a voicemail yesterday and I finally get up the courage to call them back. I was on Accutane for six months last year and it was the best decision of my life, but the medication, copays, blood tests, and moisturizers were a hefty monthly expense. I don't want to call them just to find out that I owe more money. However, it turns out that my insurance covered it, and they're reimbursing me $150! 12 p.m. — My incredibly generous brother bought me a new touring bike for Christmas. Anyone into cycling knows that the bike is truly not the most expensive part of the hobby. I hop on Amazon, my one true love, to pick up a new rack, GPS holder, and a fancy sleeping pad on sale. I'm biking from Mexico to San Francisco then S.F. to Canada this summer, so lighter gear to go with my lighter bike seems like justified purchases. $88.52 1:30 p.m. — The banana, a yogurt, and a fiber bar from my desk quell my hunger until my afternoon meeting. Our director tries to entice staff to attend by providing goodies, so I grab a cup of coffee, some fruit, and a cookie the size of my head. Can't fight my freegan tendencies. 5 p.m. — I'm finally on the bus heading home. My partner and I determined it was financially responsible to downsize to one car when we moved here almost two years ago. We've been incredibly fortunate to have access to so many alternative methods of transportation, including my heavily employer-subsidized unlimited bus pass. 6 p.m. — I'm greeted at the door with my favorite smell: pizza and garlic knots. We haven't had time to grocery shop in over a week. Though my partner is an excellent cook, I can't say I'm disappointed in tonight's meal. 8 p.m. — I'm still on a high from ordering touring gear earlier. I browse Costco's website and find a lightweight, three-season, down sleeping bag for $140. My dad, ever the pragmatist, gave me a $100 Costco gift card for Christmas 2015, so I pay using that, with a small balance, including tax. $52.24 Daily Total: $143.52",1,131
"7 a.m. — The first of the month is always a painful day. This morning I handed my partner a rent check for $1,550. (He'll pay me back $550 later.) After getting to work, I find payment confirmations for both of my student loans. The minimum payments are about $150/month, but since I'd like to finish paying them back before I reach menopause, I set up automatic bill pay for $200/month per loan. Pro tip: I got a 0.5% reduction on the interest rate of my federal loans by setting up automatic payments. 8 a.m. — The hole in my bank account hasn't been plugged quite yet. Today is the last day to pay my tuition bill without penalty. My post-bach program has been far more rewarding and challenging than undergrad ever was. (Challenging in part because I'm paying for it with my own income rather than through loans and scholarships.) I think this $1,120 will be a great investment in my future. $1,120 8:15 a.m. — I quietly praise Past-Me for getting a second yogurt yesterday, and I round out breakfast with a fig bar from my desk. 12 p.m. — Time for another Trader Joe's run. My partner makes less than half of what I do, so typically he brings last night's leftovers for lunch and I buy something here. I pick up a salad, an orange, a protein shake, and a bottle of water. I plastic water bottles, but my sister stole my reusable one last week and I can't use my CamelBak during my workout. I vow to reuse this one until it's nonfunctional! $7.01 4:30 p.m. — I gulp half of my protein shake and bike over to my CrossFit class. One of the other huge perks of working here: My employer offers a free 12-week workout and nutrition program for staff. I'm terrible at motivating myself to hit the gym, so the accountability factor is just as attractive as the price tag. 6:30 p.m. — I shakily gulp the second half of my protein shake and hop on my bike. I'm concerned I no longer have the forearm strength to grip the brake. 7:30 p.m. — Thank god I'm home! I try to soothe my sore muscles with toppings from a leftover pizza slice (chicken and cheese are protein!) and then hit the shower. Daily Total: $1,127.01",2,131
"6:30 a.m. — I forgot my bus pass at the office and have to pay the (admittedly reduced) fare. $0.50 9 a.m. — Feeling run down, I grab a tall latte and protein bistro box from Starbucks using an old gift card. One of these days I'll get around to grocery shopping for all of these ingredients. 12:30 p.m. — I received some disappointing news: The summer language program I was accepted to in October is only offering me a half-ride in grants. With my current savings and theoretical tax return, I might still be short $1,000 - $2,000. I have two weeks to decide whether or not to enroll and risk needing a loan, or to decline. Decisions, decisions… 12:34 p.m. — I stress eat the remainder of my bistro box and a fig bar at my desk. 4:20 p.m. — I give up on work for the day and bike home. My partner picked up ingredients for quinoa jambalaya, so we enjoy our twist on Southern cuisine with hard cider and a few episodes of before bed. Daily Total: $0.50",3,131
"7:30 a.m. — I am in a mood today, which means I want to spend money on unnecessary food and clothes. Must. Resist. 11 a.m. — I'm pretty hungry already, but there's going to be free lunch at the symposium I'm attending at 12:30. I'm sure there's a karma tally sheet somewhere that keeps track of how many lectures I go to because I'm interested in the topic, versus how many I go to because there's free food. 1 p.m. — OMG, free food! I grab a turkey sandwich meal box and settle in. 6:15 p.m. — CrossFit was surprisingly fun tonight. I hop on my bike and ride home to snack and sleep. Daily Total: $0",4,131
"7 a.m. — It's No-Spend Saturday! My partner and I start our morning with a “breakfast pile,” which entails taking any leftovers or small portions of food we have, combining it with eggs, and throwing it in a cast iron skillet. Today's breakfast pile: spinach, onion, avocado, bacon, chicken sausage, and mushrooms, plus some toast from last week's hamburger buns. 9 a.m. — I spend the rest of the day on homework and self-care. I dye my brows, shave, give myself a facial, and throw some laundry in the wash. Laundry costs $3 to wash and dry but my partner takes care of the quarters this week. 9 p.m. — After a day of munching on food and watching , I go to bed. Daily Total: $0",5,131
"11 a.m. — My brother and his fiancé bike up to my place, and we bike another 15 miles to grab burgers. Their combined income is more than six times mine, so they happily pay. 3 p.m. — I'm less than a mile from my house when I clip some uneven pavement and go flying. Being a mature adult, I'm too afraid to check out my arm and figure out whether it requires stitches. (I'm honestly not sure if I'm more afraid of seeing my bones or of the impending doctor's bill.) My water bottle cage must have shattered on impact, so I grab the shards and my bottle and slowly peddle home. 3:30 p.m. — Somehow, we get back home in time for kickoff — we're huge Falcons fans! I pull my lucky jersey over my non-bloody side and settle in with buffalo chicken dip. 4 p.m. — I'm going to pretend I'm screaming at the game and not at my partner brushing debris out of what's left of my elbow. I'm glad my Doomsday kit has extra-large gauze pads. 8 p.m. — The emotional pain of the Falcons losing might be worse than my physical pain. I pop some Advil PM and crawl into bed angry. Daily Total: $0",6,131
"6 a.m. — It's definitely a day for riding the bus. 8 a.m. — My brother and I are biking down to San Diego this weekend and I genuinely can't go without a bottle cage. More money sacrificed to the Amazon gods. $8.49 12 p.m. — I get an email that CrossFit is canceled. In an effort to keep things healthy, I snack on an orange from my desk and plan out lunch. 1 p.m. — Just kidding! My boss dumps a ton of work on my desk that needs to be completed ASAP. I grab a mint from my secretary's desk and pretend it's filling. 6 p.m. — After a long bus ride, I stop at the grocer near my house and pick up a frozen lasagna, a blend of Italian cheeses, and frozen broccoli. $15.28 7:30 p.m. — My partner has a great group of friends and a few of them join us for dinner unexpectedly. (Glad I got the large lasagna!) Someone brings bread and wine, and we enjoy a nice “family” dinner. 10 p.m. — I dish out hugs and last-minute motherly advice. (I swear, twentysomething men wouldn't shower unless a woman incentivized it.) The dishes will be left for another time. Daily Total: $23.77",7,131
"11 a.m. — I wake up and make breakfast: avocado toast with spinach and tomato, fried eggs, and a glass of tangerine juice. I love breakfast and always make sure I have enough food to make for it. 2 p.m. — My MetroCard expires tomorrow, so I refill it on my way to my hair appointment. $116.50 4 p.m. — I finish my hair appointment at Devachan salon. I have really curly hair that has been damaged, so I need to go to a top-notch place. $158.95 6:30 p.m. — I don't have time for grocery shopping and don't have anything to make at home, so I snag some Chipotle. $9 11:59 p.m. — I watch the infamous Oscars mix-up (congrats to !) and go to bed. Daily Total: $284.45",1,132
"7 a.m. — I'm on spring break right now, but decide to stay in town and work an extra day at my internship to get some extra cash. I make a bagel with cream cheese and two hardboiled eggs for breakfast, and a peanut-butter-and-jelly sandwich with snacks for lunch. 5:15 p.m. — I need to get home to complete a homework assignment. I don't have time to go grocery shopping and make dinner, so I grab a salad from Chopt. $19 8 p.m. — I'm giving up junk food for Lent soon, so I get some candy and buy my boyfriend an Arizona Sweet Tea. $3.99 10 p.m. — Bedtime, because I'm super-tired. Daily Total: $22.99",2,132
"7 a.m. — I still need to go grocery shopping, so I eat two soft-boiled eggs for breakfast and another PB&J for lunch. 12:45 p.m. — It's my lunch break. I eat the food I brought to work and then go to DavidsTea for an iced peach matcha tea. $4.36 5:15 p.m. — BCBG on Madison Avenue is going out of business, so I have to see what they have. I don't buy anything because they're closing up by the time I get there — and also because I need to be an adult and buy groceries. 7 p.m. — It's my last day before Lent to consume my favorite junk-food treats, so my boyfriend and I go to one of our favorite pizza spots. He pays. 8 p.m. — Time to buy groceries! I was running low on some key things and getting tired of PB&Js. $35.57 9 p.m. — Now that I actually have food, I prepare everything for tomorrow's salad. Daily Total: $39.93",3,132
"8 a.m. — I go to mass for Ash Wednesday and then head to work around 9:45. On my way to the office, I grab an iced peach matcha tea from DavidsTea. I'm addicted at this point. $4.36 2 p.m. — I eat the salad I made at home last night for lunch. 6 p.m. — Instead of going back to BCBG, I go to the Elizabeth and James sample sale to see if they have a bag I've been eyeing... They do. $194.89 8 p.m. — I make chicken and broccoli Alfredo for my boyfriend and I to eat. I didn't have bread to make garlic bread, so we order some from up the street. $2.73 Daily Total: $201.98",4,132
"2 p.m. — Leftover pasta for lunch. I like making pasta for dinner because then I don't have to worry about making lunch beforehand for the next day. 7 p.m. — I need a few more groceries, so I run to the store really quick. $11.67 Daily Total: $11.67",5,132
"9 a.m. — I wake up and make breakfast at home. I eat an egg and Fig Bars because I don't have time to make a meal. 11:45 a.m. — My boyfriend and I catch a matinee showing of , on me. $20.21 1:15 p.m. — We're starving afterwards, so we get Mexican food at Blockheads across the street; he pays. 2 p.m. — After eating, we check out the new Raymond Pettibon exhibit at the New Museum. I loved the waves (and paid for both of our tickets). $24 4:30 p.m. — We pick up my boyfriend's sister, and then I pick up some of my beauty needs from Bed Bath & Beyond. $18.17 7 p.m. — My boyfriend buys us oxtail to eat before we meet up with some of his friends ($21.50). 8:30 p.m. — We meet up with some high school friends at a bar in Queens. Neither of us drinks anything, but I decide to smoke some hookah. $11.50 Daily Total: $73.88",6,132
"10 a.m. — I wake up, have a quiet morning to myself, and make pancakes. 2 p.m. — Some of my beauty products have run low, so I decide to run a few errands. I replenish some of my products; and get new utensils for my dorm, a very belated birthday gift for my boyfriend, and some soup. $115.52 5 p.m. — I do some laundry and cleaning that needed to get done at home. 8 p.m. — My boyfriend comes over. I finish my oxtail from yesterday and we watch . Daily Total: $115.52",7,132
"8:30 a.m. — My husband texts me from the office that he forgot to lay out money for our cleaning lady. I run to the ATM and take out $100; $80 for this week's cleaning and an extra $20 to fund the laundry card she uses to wash our clothes. When I get home, it's just about time for me to be at work, so I grab a piece of brioche off the counter and slather it in almond butter for a breakfast on the run. I grab some tea for free at the office to get in my caffeine fix. $100 2 p.m. — With all the fuss this morning, I forgot about bringing lunch. Apparently, I got so lost in the work shuffle that I didn't realize I was starving. I head around the corner for a salad (avocado, olives, tomatoes, caramelized onions, buffalo mozzarella, and pesto dressing) at my local semi-Cuban soup, salad, and sandwich joint. I drink water in a S'well bottle I brought from home. It keeps my water cold all day! $11.36 4:38 p.m. — I'm an attorney by trade, so I don't pay for anything I don't get. Last week, my Hello Fresh delivery came with rotten produce, so I complained and received a $10 credit toward this week's delivery, bringing the weekly price down from $69 to $59. However, this week, I was supposed to receive my Hello Fresh delivery Monday evening, but today is Tuesday, and it still hasn't arrived. I've already called the company to inquire and sent a few emails regarding a possible remedy, but no response. The tracking information says my delivery is indefinitely delayed. There is no way I'm eating rotten steak for any price. I pull up my American Express account and dispute the $59 charge for this week. Hello? Fresh? 4:45 p.m. — My husband and I both do well, and we more or less keep completely separate finances. I moved in with him just prior to our marriage, so he was already paying the rent and utilities. I pay for my own expenses, my own car payment, our entertainment, and most of our food and other incidental expenses. We've been meaning to work out a better system, but we at least both agree that ""what's mine is yours"" and vice versa. Based on the status of my Hello Fresh delivery, I text my husband that he is in charge of buying groceries for tonight's dinner. He picks up ingredients to make this amazing chicken-shawarma recipe that we've been obsessed with of late and chickpeas so we can mix up some hummus. He also picks up a bottle of white wine. What a guy. 6:30 p.m. — I head to FlyBarre for a 45-minute workout, part of my monthly membership. I walk there and back for a little extra exercise and enjoy the beautiful Miami sunset. 9 p.m. — The husband and I cook the shawarma together and sit down for a late dinner and this week's episode of , the show you love to hate. The meal is excellent. Daily Total: $111.36",1,133
"7:45 a.m. — Time for breakfast. I pull some pre-sliced pineapple out of the fridge and toast up another piece of brioche. We're out of almond butter, so I eat it plain. 9 a.m. — I grab a free cup of tea at the office and get down to work. I've got a deposition scheduled later this afternoon, and I've had ideas spinning in my head all night about the best strategy to take. 1 p.m. — Leftover shawarma for lunch. 2:45 p.m. — Hello Fresh finally gets back to me about my complaints and offers to credit my account for the next two weeks' worth of groceries: $69 per week. I'm still not happy about this week's situation, but I'm willing to stick with the service long enough to forget about it. 5:45 p.m. — I'm in the middle of planning a birthday party for my husband in Vegas, and I'm shelling out the dough for show tickets for a group of us. I should be reimbursed for $400 of the $600...but I'm not holding my breath. $600 7:15 p.m. — Speaking of birthdays, tonight we're out for Indian food to celebrate the birthday of a good friend. The husband picks up our portion of the tab. 11:45 p.m. — One of my friends sends me the $200 she owes me for the Vegas show tickets via Venmo. Daily Total: $400",2,133
"6 a.m. — My husband's cell phone starts ringing with urgent work calls that neither of us is ready to deal with. I make myself a Nespresso and a bowl of oatmeal and bring both with me back to bed. I check my work calendar to make sure I have nothing scheduled early, and I start responding to a few work emails from bed. 7 a.m. — I look up a bar deal my friends are buying in Vegas. It's a daytime pool party with a ""Spring Break"" theme. Sounds a little too much like the parts of home I already avoid. I pull up the pricing just to see: The event costs $20 for men and $10 for women. I roll my eyes, and close out the browser in disgust. 9:30 a.m. — Considering how early I was up, I somehow manage to arrive to work late after sitting in Miami traffic/construction/mass incompetence. I've already had my coffee for the day, but I make myself a cup of tea at work anyways. 11:15 a.m. — I get an email about an online sale at Intermix. I've been eyeing a shirt with an original retail price of $125. Last I looked, the shirt was on sale for $79, and I got as far as adding it to my shopping cart before I bailed. Today, I see that the shirt is an additional 30% off. $125 down to $55.30. Never pay retail! With tax and shipping, my total comes out to $69.88, but I'm feeling pretty good about my price-stalking. Sometimes it pays to be patient. $69.88 1:15 p.m. — It's my coworker's birthday, and my work section takes her out to a local seafood joint. I'm lucky to work in such a supportive environment. Three of us split the bill for four people. $55.25 5:30 p.m. — I realize my Plan A for this evening's dinner is still rotting in a delivery truck somewhere. I swing by Publix and grab some ground turkey, an onion, a zucchini, a spaghetti squash, and a jar of Rao's tomato sauce (the best!). I try to stay on task, but I also end up grabbing a new jar of almond butter and a birthday card for my husband's friend (the one whose birthday was last night) because it's just such an on-point card. $40.76 6 p.m. — My parents are visiting this weekend, and I see that our home hockey team is in town playing the Florida Panthers. My dad is a huge hockey fanatic, and my husband and I have been meaning to get to a game. Plus, I want my parents to have a little fun while they're in town. I pick up four tickets for Saturday night. $282.60 6:30 p.m. — Back to FlyBarre for the second class of the week. 9 p.m. — Dinner is served! We pull up my husband's Amazon Prime account that he got for work and watch a few episodes of our latest obsession, . Daily Total: $448.49",3,133
"7:45 a.m. — I woke up at 5 a.m., saw that it was still dark out, and stayed in bed another hour thinking about how I should probably get up and do something productive. Eventually, I fell back asleep. I wake up to my husband leaving the house for work. I make another bowl of oatmeal and a Nespresso. Before leaving the house, I make a lunch-meat-and-brioche sandwich and grab an apple for lunch. TGIF. 1:30 p.m. — Lunch in the office lunch room with coworkers, watching the rain fall down the windows outside. 7:32 p.m. — We use Postmates to order dinner from an amazing pizza place that is both difficult to reach and has a very small dining area. There are a lot of tourists in town this weekend for a music festival, so we're trying to lay low and avoid mass chaos. The husband had a rough work week and just wants to decompress in pajamas, which works for me. We get sucked into some true-crime series on A&E. $50.78 Daily Total: $50.78",4,133
"7 a.m. — I grab an apple and some almond butter for breakfast and do some work on my computer in bed. 8:30 a.m. — I sign my husband and I up for a charity walk in honor of one of my best friends' daughters, who was born with a genetic disease. We will both also probably make separate donations to the walk and try to do a little fundraising. We hope to travel to attend, but even if that's not possible, there are ways to show up without actually showing up for the people you care about. $40 9:30 a.m. — I hit up the FlyBarre. I realize I haven't been to Flywheel all week and that I'm gonna die tomorrow when my husband and I go to our usual Sunday class. 12 p.m. — We meet up with my parents at their hotel and take a walk around Miami Beach. We visit the free Miami Beach Botanical Garden and see a group of turtles sunbathing, a tree with naturally rainbow-colored bark, and a Japanese garden. 2 p.m. — We take my parents to a sidewalk café for lunch and pick up the tab for everyone. $82 7 p.m. — We drive to the hockey game. Parking costs $20, but my parents have the cash on hand to cover it. My husband buys himself two beers and a hot dog, and he buys me a bottle of water and a soft pretzel. He also buys my mom a bottle of water. My parents apparently snuck their own snacks into the arena... Daily Total: $122",5,133
"8 a.m. — I eat another slice of brioche (starting t0 get stale) with almond butter for breakfast. 9:30 a.m. — My husband and I hit up a Flywheel class together. He scores exactly 100 points more than I do. Show-off. 10:30 a.m. — My husband hasn't eaten breakfast and wants to head to our local bakery on the way home. He buys two cookies and a breakfast pastry. As soon as we get home, we each eat a cookie. 12 p.m. — We take my parents to brunch at an organic restaurant. I have a quinoa-and-roasted-vegetable salad with a fried-egg-and-avocado purée, as well as steamed matcha-and-cashew milk. My parents pick up the tab. 2 p.m. — We drive my parents about an hour south to a fruit-and-spice park in Homestead. Admission is $8 per person, and I purchase all the tickets. My parents love trying the star apples, jackfruit, and ice cream beans and seeing all the fruit trees. $32 3:30 p.m. — While we're down in farmland, I fill up my car with gas for the week. It's way cheaper outside of the city. $32 3:45 p.m. — We stop for ice cream on the way home at a place that I've been meaning to try, but that is too far to drive to for just ice cream. My parents pay for our three kiddie cups and my husband's milkshake. 4 p.m. — My mom writes me a check to reimburse me for not just my parents' hockey tickets, but all of the hockey tickets. Score! 7:30 p.m. — We grab some Mexican food for a last dinner with my parents before they head home. We pick a place we can walk to, so there's no driving or parking to deal with. My husband drinks two margaritas at dinner and picks up the tab. His parent tolerance is running low. 9 p.m. — I'm pretty sure I couldn't eat another thing, but my dad wants to go to a macaroon store across the street. He doesn't want to be the only one eating a macaroon, so my husband and I reluctantly agree to try one as well. My dad pays for the three macaroons. My parents thank us for a great weekend, and we drop them off at their hotel. 9:15 p.m. — . This season is so, so, so, good. Daily Total: $64",6,133
"8 a.m. — Monday morning already? I head into the kitchen still half asleep and discover that my husband actually bought four cookies yesterday at the bakery, not two. Cookie for breakfast? Yup. It had peanut butter in it, so it sort of counts as protein. 9 a.m. — Free tea. 12:45 p.m. — I brought some leftover pizza and salad from Friday night's dinner for lunch. My husband is very anti-leftover, so I try to make use of whatever I can during the meals I eat without him. 4:30 p.m. — I head into the office kitchen for another cup of tea, but somehow end up leaving with a cup of hot chocolate, instead. This is what happens when you start your day with a cookie. 5:30 p.m. — My husband has to work late, so I pick up a prescription for him and grab a jar of Advil while there. Last time, we went cheap and bought some generic ibuprofen liquid gels, which mostly burst. We were picking the pills off the sides of the jar, where they were stuck in pools of some kind of petroleum jelly-like substance from inside the pills. I'm only buying the real stuff from now on. I do pick up a package with a $1 coupon attached to it, which the cashier applies at checkout. $16.49 6 p.m. — I am intending to go to our local supermarket, which is relatively cheap, but my right foot has some kind of Freudian complex and drives right past it to the upscale organic market. Inside, I buy two boxes of gluten-free granola bars, a box of gluten-free cookies, raspberries, mango-coconut chia pouches, and a bottle of white wine for tonight's dinner. $38.32 6:30 p.m. — I unload all the groceries, which inevitably turns into cleaning out my fridge. I decide to keep the brioche in the freezer to make bread pudding. I end up throwing away two types of cheese that have turned green, the now eight-day-old lunch meat, leftovers from Thursday night's dinner, and some sour cream I find that expired last month. We tend to do a little better with the leftover situation when we don't have guests in town, but I'm not going to pretend that this isn't pretty normal. 7 p.m. — Hello Fresh has arrived! Thank goodness, because if I had to figure out how to make dinner with what we currently have on hand, it would've been a serious win for Postmates. 7:30 p.m. — I throw in a load of laundry that doesn't need to go in the dryer. In the Florida humidity, it's probably going to take the next three days to dry in my living room. $2.25 9 p.m. — Wasabi-lime salmon with white wine is served! Daily Total: $57.06",7,133
"5:30 a.m. — I wake up before my alarm goes off, but I don't want to move. My cat jumps on the bed and snuggles with me, a thing he never normally does. I decide to bask in this love and stay in bed until my next alarm. I guess I won't be going for a run this morning. 8:30 a.m. — I don't normally drive to work, but I have yoga this evening and I know my bus won't still be running by the time it's finished. I park in a garage where I get a discount with my faculty ID, gather all my things, and head to work. This garage is better for tonight but a longer walk to the office. It's a beautiful, cool morning, so I don't mind the extra distance. 9 a.m. — At my desk, computer booted, with breakfast: a bowl of cantaloupe I purchased this weekend, a cherry pie Lara Bar (purchased in bulk, thanks to Amazon), and a cup of grapefruit juice. I munch while I check emails and organize my day. 12 p.m. — Just realized what time it is, and how hungry I am. It's been a productive, fun morning, so I'm ready to take a break. I've brought my lunch today: chicken and apple sausages with spicy brown mustard. I eat some more of my cantaloupe as well. I've been thinking about getting a desk for my condo, so I browse online for one while I eat at my desk. It's an incredibly sunny afternoon, so I don't mind sitting by my window while I live in my slightly antisocial lunch bubble. 1 p.m. — Oh man, I find a desk I love from West Elm, but I can't see myself spending $280 on a piece. I find a cheaper version for about $80, but it's easy to see the difference in quality. I may dwell on this for a while. I had to force myself to stop eating all the cantaloupe I brought, so I can have some for breakfast tomorrow. (It wasn't easy.) 4:30 p.m. — I am back at my desk after attending a couple of open lectures on campus. Feeling inspired but a little tired, so I have a few pieces of Trader Joe's extra dark chocolate I keep at my desk. They are good, but a bit too bitter for what I'm craving, so I decide to visit Starbucks instead. I reload my card on my app and get a tall chai latte with a shot of vanilla and a peanut butter cup cookie. I also finish up my word search puzzle on my desk daily calendar. $15 5:15 p.m. — I'm off to yoga. I bought a package last week that was discounted, since it's done through the college I work for. It's once a week, and today is the first day. 6:30 p.m. — Yoga is great, but makes me so aware of how much I need to start running and working out again. I get in my car and head towards home. $7 7 p.m. — I probably don't need to, but I go to Trader Joe's since it's on the way home to pick up extra food for the week. I am not that hungry, so I'll make something to bring for lunch tomorrow and have some extra goodies for later this week and next. My cat is very happy to see me when I get home, and I'm positive it's because he's eaten all of the food he gets in the morning for the day. I clean up and and throw chicken into the oven for lunch this week. $59.63 9 p.m. — One of my best friends is in the area and comes over to visit. I rent a movie for us to watch through Amazon Prime. I don't normally rent movies, but my sister-in-law's very good friend stars in and directs it, so I don't mind! $6 10:30 p.m. — My friend leaves, and oddly enough, we haven't watched any of the movie at all. It was definitely a night for cozy blankets and girl talk. It was good to see her, and my movie is good for seven days. I text my boyfriend to see what his plans are tomorrow and decide to drive to his place in the morning before work to drop off the kitty. There's no point in trying to do anything else because I'm so tired, but I start reading , which I got months ago but haven't gotten to. Daily Total: $87.63",1,134
"6:15 a.m. — I missed my window for a morning run, so I get my morning started by taking care of a hungry cat and then a shower. I know I have to leave around 7, so I make quick work of my getting-ready routine. 7:30 a.m. — Brought the kitty to my boyfriend's this morning; it made sense to do this since I plan on staying at his place tonight, but it was a frustrating morning of cat-wrangling and traffic. The boyfriend is still sleepy, so I decide to participate in morning snuggles instead of rushing to catch a bus. 8:30 a.m. — Park downtown and sit at my desk enjoying a repeat breakfast from yesterday: cantaloupe and a cherry pie Lara Bar. I also sneak a piece of extra-dark chocolate. Today is a busier day, so I'll spend the next 30 minutes just getting in the work-day groove. 12 p.m. — I brought the chicken that I made last night for lunch today, along with arroz con gandules that I made over the weekend. I have too much to accomplish this afternoon, so I eat lunch at my desk; again, it's a beautiful, sunny day, but I don't mind enjoying the view from my window (and having all the benefits of air conditioning). 6 p.m. — I get off work a lot later than expected, but that's the good thing with the discounted parking; it maxes out at $7 a day. I head over to my boyfriend's place so we can figure out dinner plans. $7 7:30 p.m. — The boyfriend and I go to dinner with two of our good married friends at Thai Elephant. I get the Pad See Ew (which gives me life), and we also have crab wontons. It's a really fun evening out, and my lovely partner picks up the tab for the two of us. 9:30 p.m. — Once back home, we catch up on . I notoriously fall asleep before him, so he jokes that he'll snuggle with me until I fall asleep, and then go back to reading...which is exactly what happens. Daily Total: $7",2,134
"7:30 a.m. — Boo-hiss. I forgot to charge my phone last night, so I wake up later than planned. There was no sense in scrambling for the bus, so I drive to work. I grab a tall chai latte with a shot of vanilla, and because it's feeling like one of those mornings, I also get a cheese danish. I pay with the money on my Starbucks app that I loaded earlier this week. I enjoy my breakfast at my desk and start my daily word search puzzle. 11 a.m. — I'm a little annoyed because my first gel manicure ever has chipped off my thumb after six days of wear. I run to CVS to find a similar shade to have even nails for the rest of the day. I doubt I'll go back to that salon anytime soon. Since it's CVS, all their beauty products are marked up. However, I get the Revlon shade ""Coy"" which is a near-perfect match. I also pick up polish remover, just in case. $9.20 12 p.m. — Lunch time! For some reason, I'm so hungry I have a headache. I decide to have chicken and rice again today for lunch. I realize I left the giant thermos of water I normally carry with me at my boyfriend's place, so I fill up a random cup at the water fountain. I also pop a few ibuprofen in case my headache isn't from hunger. 4 p.m. — Done with work for the day, so I pay for parking and head to a very fun wax appointment. So looking forward to my Brazilian. (Mostly sarcasm.) $7 5 p.m. — I was talked into buying a package at my last appointment, so I don't have to pay anything today. I do, however, leave a tip. $10 5:30 — I have some time to kill before meeting someone, so I run to Target. This is a dangerous game: I don't really need anything, but the dollar section speaks to me... I end up buying thank-you notecards, pens, and a to-do list notepad. I realize I'm super hungry, and a hot dog sounds so good, so I get one from the Target café. $7.92 6:30 p.m. — Back at my place to meet with someone who is buying a piece of furniture from me. She and her husband love the bench I'm selling, and I make $75. After they leave, I water my plants and head back to my boyfriend's. Too much driving back and forth today, but leftover Thai food is calling my name. (As is spending time with him. But mostly Thai food, at the moment.) 8 p.m. — We successfully reheat a massive amount of leftover chicken pad see ew. We eat all of it and have no regrets. It's even better the second day. 9 p.m. — I suggest we watch the movie I rented earlier this week. It ends up being okay. I'm glad to support my sis-in-law's friend, but halfway through the movie I feel super guilty making the boyfriend watch it. I know it's not his thing. The movie is actually too much to be my thing, either. Daily Total: $34.12",3,134
"7 a.m. — Despite a rough night of not being able to sleep, I am to take the bus this morning, so I get ready and walk to the bus. Free ride to work this morning! 9 a.m. — A very sweet coworker brought a big-ass box of donuts from Glazed. I have one, and it gives me life. 10 a.m. — I decide to walk to a different Starbucks to redeem my stars for a free drink. Because it's totally free, I splurge and create something with the barista: a Venti coconut milk chai latte, with two shots of espresso and a shot of vanilla. I can't really taste the espresso, and I'm not sure I'm loving the coconut milk, but it's not bad and I (technically) didn't have to pay for it. (Earning stars in the Starbucks app is the only way I justify spending money at Starbucks. They've had several promotions going on, so I basically earned two free drinks within a very short period of time.) 12 p.m. — Chicken and rice again for lunch today. I'm glad this is the last helping, as I'm getting a little tired of it. (Even if it's delicious.) 4 p.m. — Done with work! I was going to head back to the boyfriend's, but a friend of mine asks to hang out after she gets off work. Since we are meeting downtown, it makes sense to just stay in the area. 4:30 p.m. — I stumble upon a  boutique that is super cute and full of local and artisanal bits and bobs. I buy a candle that smells like cilantro, a few Charleston-made greeting cards, and some chocolate. $33.45 5 p.m. — I also find a place I've never been to before called Peace Pie; it's essentially a shop that sells ice cream sandwiches with pie filling. The guy is a good salesman. I leave with a super delicious chocolate and banana ice cream sandwich. $6.50 5:30 p.m. — My friend wants to look at Aldo for flats. I wear flats almost exclusively to work because walking downtown in heels can be a bit traumatic. (Cobblestones are evil.) They have a really cute pair that are on sale. My friend is a terrible influence, and I buy them. I feel a little guilty but I know they will get a ton of use. $34.48 6 p.m. — It turns out that my friend is going to the new-ish cat café, Pounce. Her friend cancelled on her, and I'm super jazzed to go! She's already paid for the admission and free drink and deems it her treat. It ends up being a lot of fun, and I text my boyfriend that I want to come home with another kitty. (I don't.) 7:30 p.m. — My friend gives me a ride back to my boyfriend's place, and the three of us decide to go out for sushi; her husband meets us at Osaka. The food is so good, and my boyfriend and I have managed to figure out the magical amount to order without us feeling like slugs for the rest of the night. He pays for the two of us. 9 p.m. — I have a headache and am feeling a bit off, so we mindlessly watch something online. I fall asleep before it's over. Daily Total: $74.43",4,134
"10 a.m. — Saturday! Hooray! I'm up and out the door with the kitty. The boyfriend is going to his parents' for the rest of the day to help them with some projects, and then he is going off to a job the next day for work. We say our goodbyes. I'm rushing to get home because I'm selling a bookcase and need to meet with the buyer by 11. 11:15 a.m. — Bookcase sold! I've made an extra $100. I get home, realize that I still feel off from the night before, but also super hungry. I have a steak that's waiting to be cooked, and despite it feeling a bit indulgent for a pre-noon lunch, I cook it. It's delicious, and I'm in a food coma on the sofa. I know I should eat something green, but I'm just not in the mood. Instead I eat far too much coconut milk chocolate ice cream from Trader Joe's. I zone out to on Netflix and take an unanticipated nap. 4 p.m. — Whoops. That was a much longer nap than anticipated... I feel crummy and decide to redo my nails and drink tons of water. My gel nails lasted barely a week, so the refresh looks great. While they are drying, a good friend texts me to let me know she and her boyfriend are hanging out. I've yet to meet her beau, so I commit to come spend some time with them to get to know him. 6:30 p.m. — Hanging out with my friend and her boyfriend at her place. I feel better after chugging lots of water, so I decline when she offers me a drink. They have another party to get to, so I don't visit too long. 8 p.m. — It still feels early, so I meet up with a friend in the area. We end up going to a wine and cheese bar and have some girl time. We order a bottle of wine, hummus and pita, and bread with olive oil. We split the bill down the middle. $23.45 11:30 p.m. — So tired. My cat curls up at the foot of the bed, and I'm out within minutes. Daily Total: $23.45",5,134
"10:30 a.m. — It's blissful to sleep in on Sunday morning. I had super crazy dreams, so I am pretty dead to the world. I have a breakfast pastry that I got from Trader Joe's earlier in the week, with a cup of tea. 11:30 a.m. — My friend from the night before is in my area running errands, so we meet up after to go shopping; she's still looking for flats, and I'm trying to find dresses to wear for work. Instead I find some cute, comfortable heels and very versatile tops from White House Black Market. I also decide to get some Sperry boat shoes since spring is here, and I'm sure more boat trips are in the future. $218.36 2:30 p.m. — Home. Hungry. I spent more than anticipated today, so I eat in. I really want a salad, but the lettuce I have appears to have gone bad. I settle on some falafel patties from Trader Joe's and cook some fresh broccoli. 8:30 p.m. — Where did my evening go? I haven't had dinner, so I munch on some blue chips and black bean hummus. 9:30 p.m. — I'm actually feeling really drained from being so inactive, so I decide to head to bed and read. Daily Total: $218.36",6,134
"7 a.m. — Holy cow. I slept for a long time last night, despite some incredibly wacky dreams. I decide to clean up this morning since I was a bit of a sloth yesterday. I feed the kitty and make a ginger green tea for myself. I'm debating wearing my new heels today, which really dictates my outfit since they are bright fuchsia. 8:50 a.m. — Since I'm apparently not stressing about getting ready this morning, I drive to work to make sure I get in by 9 a.m. A coworker has already commented on my shoes. I'm glad I wore them...for now. 9:15 a.m. — Breakfast includes a cherry pie Lara Bar. (Is it obvious that I live off of these? They are my favorite.) 11:30 p.m. — I decide to risk walking to Verde for lunch today. I find my stash of random stamped cards from the past few months, and I have enough to redeem my free salad! I get the Mesa Verde (light on onions and tomatoes) with the agave mustard dressing. It's my favorite. 12:30 p.m. — I grab a tall coconut milk latte from Starbucks using my app. I'll need to refill it soon, but if tracking my spending for work has shown me anything, it's that I go to Starbucks a . I'm helping out a different department today, so I know I'll be busy until it's time to leave for the day. (Also: Still going strong in the shoes.) 5:30 p.m. — Pay for parking and fight the traffic home. I'm feeling the shoes now. $7 6:30 p.m. — Traffic is a beast. As soon as I'm home, I kick off my heels. They weren't too bad; I've just gotten out of the habit of wearing heels all day. I put on comfy slippers and get dinner ready for the kitty and myself. I have some beef from Trader Joe's, so I warm that up in a pan, and cook up some broccoli as well. I also decide to make some coconut rice from TJ's. 8 p.m. — Wearing heels all day has made my feet ache a little, so I decide to stretch them out with a walk. I text the boyfriend while he's away. Texting is so much easier for both of us, since he can be anywhere when he's on a job and may not be able to talk. 9 p.m. — Feeling a bit refreshed and sweaty from my walk, so I jump in the shower. I decide to avoid sitting in front of the TV and crawl into bed with a book. The cat decides to join me at the foot of the bed. This is a recent change in his behavior, and I LOVE IT. Cats aren't very good for forced cuddle time, so his proximity is very welcome. 11 p.m. — I'm having a hard time falling asleep despite my eyes feeling heavy from reading. I make a cup of Sleepytime tea and do what I call ""yoga breathing"" in bed. Daily Total: $7",7,134
"8:30 a.m. — Roll out of bed and read on the couch until my fiancé wakes up. Eat a couple of pieces of Hershey's chocolate left over from Valentine's Day. 12:10 p.m. — Fiancé wakes up, so I make him coffee and throw together a simple breakfast (brunch?) using some garlic baguette and brie that we picked up at the store yesterday. I slice up some hard-boiled eggs we have in the fridge and serve those as well. 2 p.m. — After chatting for a bit, we pull ourselves together and go out to run some errands. We are out of olive oil, and I need to refill my bus card. We walk to the bus station, and I refill my card ($57.25, included in monthly expenses above). It's unseasonably warm, so we decide to walk the 20-some blocks to our favorite local grocery instead of taking the train. On our way to the store, we pass Duane Reade, and I remember that I am on my last drops of foundation, and my fiancé needs his face wash. We pop into Duane Reade and decide against the purchase as everything we need could be purchased cheaper on Amazon. We walk by a Dunkin' Donuts on our way to the store, and I pop in for a medium coffee. $2.50 2:30 p.m. — At the store, we pick up five liters of olive oil (an essential in our house, and it will last for a long while). My fiancé notices that they stocked the Moroccan flatbread that I like, so he grabs two pieces for me. Hummus is on sale, two for $7, so we grab two. The total is $49.99, but my fiancé pays for the groceries today, since I spent about $100 yesterday on food (an enormous wheel of brie, edam, bread, Greek yogurt, avocados, grapes, clementines, frozen pierogies, chicken dumplings, sour cream, cold crab salad, and a few baked goods). 3:15 p.m. — While walking back home, we notice that Modell's is having a sidewalk sale. I've been needing a new pair of supportive running shoes for a while; I twisted my ankle last year and can still feel the injury when I'm on the treadmill. On a whim, we decide to go in, and I take stock of the sneakers. The salesgirl recommends a pair of Nikes to me, which feel like heaven on the feet and are on sale. I decide to purchase them using a $100 gift card I received from the president of my company at Christmas and have been saving for a big purchase. The total is $89.90, so it's covered by the card. While I'm at it, I stop at the T.J. Maxx across the street and buy two six-packs of athletic socks. I use the rest of the card and end up paying the remainder. $5.97 4 p.m. — Back home, and I have to do some laundry. I refill our laundry card and throw two loads in the wash. While my fiancé chats with his family back home, I do some food prep for the week. I cook a lot during the week for myself, but I like to prepare meals for my fiancé to take with him to work or come home to, since he comes home super late, and him banging around the kitchen to cook would wake me up (also, one can only eat so much chicken over rice). This week, I put together chicken and avocado wraps with chili-lime salsa, and falafel-tomato-hummus wraps, which I stick in the freezer. $10 6:30 p.m. — We are getting hungry, so I boil and sautée some of the pierogies and chicken dumplings we purchased yesterday. I shower and we watch Netflix. 11 p.m. — Bedtime. Daily Total: $18.47",1,135
"5 a.m. — Back to the grind. I'm up and out the door by 5:50, and on the bus at 6:10. 7 a.m. — At work, I put on a pot of coffee and help myself to a cup (okay, two). 11 a.m. — I was organized enough this morning to remember to bring my Greek yogurts for the week, so I grab a coconut cream one from my stash and consider it lunch. 12 p.m. — It's the end of the month, so I send my work log and invoice to my former boss for my freelance job; I put in 14 hours over the last month. I do freelance paralegal-type work for my former boss in my off hours. She sends me small projects a couple times a week and pays me $16/hour. I bill her monthly, but the amount I receive is highly variable based on how many projects I work on in a given month. I am using 100% of the money I earn in this role for wedding savings. She emails back and promises to pay me tomorrow. 1:30 p.m. — I remember that I need to purchase our beauty supplies so I log into Amazon and check if Ebates has any cash-back deals for Amazon. I start a shopping trip in Ebates and add my foundation ($5.99) and my toner ($13.30) to my Amazon cart. I browse for my fiancé's Neutrogena face wash and notice that it would cost $9.69 for one bottle or $19.17 for three. It's a better deal to get multiple, so I add the three to my cart ($19.17). On a semi-whim, I add a bouquet of pink silk (faux) peonies that I'd been eyeing to the cart as well ($13.99). I love having plants and fresh flowers around the apartment, but since we get so little natural light in our place, all our real plants have died. I feel a little guilty after the purchase, but my foundation and toner will last me at least two months. $52.45 2:30 p.m. — The afternoon slump sets in, so I bother my coworker for a cup of her ultra-caffeinated green tea, which our other coworker brings to us from China. I strain the tea while chatting with my coworkers. 4:15 p.m. — On the bus to go home. The tea did nothing for me, and I nearly fall asleep while listening to my podcasts. 5:15 p.m. — I'm home, but can't muster enough energy to go to the gym, even though I'm excited to try out my new sneakers. I munch on a few leftover pierogies while preparing a falafel wrap, since the green tea upset my stomach. 5:30 p.m. — After I eat, I turn on Netflix and put on a sheet mask. I'm really into Korean skincare and try to do a mask at least twice a week. They do wonders for my skin. 9 p.m. — Trying to wind down and am tired from not sleeping enough last night. I read in bed for an hour and pass out a little after 10 p.m. Daily Total: $52.45",2,135
"5 a.m. — Why is Tuesday harder than Monday? Snooze until 5:10 and feel very indulgent. 7 a.m. — My usual cup of drip coffee at my desk. 7:30 a.m. — It's the last day of the month, which means payday! Any excitement I have dissipates as I transfer $950 to my fiancé's account (my portion of the rent, plus my portion of the utilities, plus parking; I am paying the full $250 for parking this month since things are a bit tight for my fiancé. He's self-employed, so he just paid his yearly taxes and also just returned from a trip back to his home country to see his parents and sick brother.) I transfer $150 to savings. Being an adult is boring. 7:30 a.m. — I don't usually carry a credit card balance, but we recently purchased plane tickets to go visit my fiancé's home country in August, and I bought one for my mom too. She was a single mom for most of her young life, and never had the chance to travel or do anything for herself, so I try to spoil her when I can. Because of the credit card payment, I'm putting less into savings this month in an attempt to pay down the balance ASAP. I also put the purchase of my fiancé's ticket on my credit card to take advantage of cash-back reward points, but he will pay me back for his ticket and part of my mom's. 1:15 p.m. — I grab a cheese stick from the office kitchen. I don't usually eat much during the work day, and I have dinner at home when I'm back from work and the gym. This is an unhealthy habit, which I'm trying to break, since I know it's not good to calorie-load at the end of the day. My coworker returns from her break and tells me it's beautiful outside, so I step out for my lunch break and take a stroll in Central Park. 2 p.m. — Back in the office and feeling bleh. My coworker in the cube next to me made a chai latte with the Keurig so I take some inspiration from her and make a dirty chai using our office espresso machine, the Keurig, and some half and half. 3:40 p.m. — Skip out 20 minutes early today since I have a dentist appointment. Luckily, the dentist is right down the street from me, so I don't have to go far. 4 p.m. — No copay at the dentist for my semi-annual cleaning. I am so thankful for health insurance. 4:40 p.m. — My teeth are sparkly and clean and I hop on the bus to go home 6:30 p.m. — I get off the bus (traffic was dreadful) and am too annoyed/discouraged by how long it took me to get home to muster any energy for the gym. My cat is meowing and guilt-tripping me when I walk through the door, which seals the deal. I jazz up an instant noodle with some frozen veggies, chicken sausage, and an egg. 7:30 p.m. — Shower and Netflix. 9:15 p.m. — My fiancé calls and we chat on the phone for a few minutes. I'm tired and decide it's time for bed. I pull together my outfit for tomorrow, and throw an umbrella in my bag since it's supposed to rain. I'm asleep by 9:45 p.m. Daily Total: $0",3,135
"5:17 a.m. — I accidentally pressed the ""stop"" button instead of ""snooze"" on my alarm! I rush to get out of the house on time. I have to be at work early today since most of our executives are in town, so I need to take an earlier bus. 6:40 a.m. — Made it on time. At work, I brew a pot of coffee and prepare myself for an insane day. 10:25 a.m. — Boss wants blueberry muffins, so I am on the hunt, in the rain. Grab a half dozen at a local deli; I pay $13.50 using petty cash from the office. 11:45 a.m. — Starving and realize I haven't eaten yet today, so I sneak half of a muffin from the kitchen. It turns out NOT to be blueberry, but instead chocolate chip. No complaints there. 12:35 p.m. — My office manager is ordering us salads for lunch since we're all swamped and can't leave today (this is unusual and happens only once every few months or so; as junior staff, our meals usually can't be expensed). I order an Asian chicken salad ($18.75, expensed) and eat at my desk. Hopefully this will give me energy to go to the gym later. 5:30 p.m. — Home by a reasonable hour today, so I change and head to the gym. It feels good to sweat! Sneakers feel good, but I definitely need more arch support. Decide I need to look online for supportive inserts. 6:45 p.m. — Shower and heat up one of the chicken wraps I made on Sunday. While it's in the oven, I call and chat with my parents. 9 p.m. — I'm just getting into bed when my fiancé calls me, and we talk on the phone for half an hour while he's on break. I wanted to go to sleep early, since I know tomorrow is going to be another crazy day, but it feels nice to chat with him. We don't see each other at all during the week because our schedules are pretty much opposite. 9:45 p.m. — Sleep! Daily Total: $0",4,135
"5 a.m. — You know the drill. 6:45 a.m. — Coffee and one of my Greek yogurts at my desk while I catch up on emails and take a look at today's calendar. 7:30 a.m. — Still nursing my coffee and I can't focus, so I browse Sephora online and read reviews of a YSL perfume I'm lusting after. My birthday is coming up in a few weeks, and this will be my birthday gift to myself. I hold off purchasing for now though, since I'm still working my way through the sample I got and I want to make sure it really works for me before I drop $90 on it. 10:30 a.m. — I need to get up and walk around so I don't fall asleep, so I brew a cup of strawberry-kiwi tea I have in my desk drawer. 1:25 p.m. — I run to the Duane Reade down the street from my office since I'm out of conditioner (why does everything run out at once?!). I pick up a hydrating hair mask while I'm there; I get a discount on my purchase because of my rewards card. $18.31 1:40 p.m. — I stop by the deli next to Duane Reade and grab a vegan bento box for lunch. I'm not vegan ('cause, hello, cheese), but the bento box is delish anyway. $5.99 4:15 p.m. — I'm free! 5:45 p.m. — At home. I change and go to the gym. 7:30 p.m. — Back from the gym, I do some light cleaning of the apartment, then shower and do a face mask while scrolling through social media. I'm not really hungry, since I had lunch earlier, so I nosh on some brie and pistachios while watching on Netflix. So gross, yet so fascinating. 10 p.m. — Bed. Daily Total: $24.30",5,135
"5 a.m. — TGIF. 6:50 a.m. — Coffee and Greek yogurt at my desk, as usual. It's quiet, so after taking care of a few small tasks I read the news and a few articles on ""The Financial Diet."" 12:40 p.m. — The office is buzzing, but I take a break to sit down and munch on some brie I brought from home and some pretzels from the office kitchen. I obviously have a thing for cheese. 1:45 p.m. — I check my credit card statement and see that my gym charged for my monthly membership. I schedule a payment for $72 (included in monthly expenses). 4 p.m. — On the bus to go home, yay! 5:15 p.m. — My fiancé calls and asks me to pick up some milk and bread for him on my way home. It is FREEZING and so windy I feel like I might fall over. $8.37 5:45 p.m. — Home and settled in for the night. I make a bowl of pasta and we chat and catch up on our weeks. 7:30 p.m. — I check my bank statement to see if my boss has paid me for my freelance work yet. She hasn't, so I email her a reminder. I've worked with her for four years, so I know she can be forgetful. She emails me back immediately and apologizes. A few minutes later, I get a notification that she direct-deposited $224 into my account. I make a mental note to go to the ATM tomorrow so I can put the money in my wedding stash. 11 p.m. — I'm exhausted from this week; bed it is. Daily Total: $8.37",6,135
"8 a.m. — Wake up to a beautiful sunny morning and read on the couch. I need a new book to read, so I browse the free selections in Amazon Prime, but nothing really appeals to me. I remember that I've been wanting to check out since my sister recommended it to me a few months ago. I find a free sample on Barnes and Noble, so I download it. 9 a.m. — Done with the sample and decide I NEED to read the whole book! Download the Nook version for $9.99 and continue reading. Mentally kick myself that I forgot to open an Ebates session before purchasing. $9.99 11:30 a.m. — My fiancé wakes up and I make us breakfast: coffee, eggs, and toast. We listen to music and laze around. 2:30 p.m. — I'm going out to meet my friend later, and my hair feels nasty, so I hop in the shower. I use the Greek yogurt hair mask that I bought earlier this week, and my hair feels super soft afterward. 4 p.m. — I put on my makeup and try to decide what to wear. I'm meeting up with my friend/coworker for dinner, and then we're going to see a live performance of a podcast we're both really into. We purchased the tickets, which were $40 each, a few months ago. I get dressed and spritz on the perfume I'm sampling. It's wonderful. 4:55 p.m. — My fiancé tells me I smell great! He is a bit bummed that I am going out and he doesn't have plans, so as a consolation I offer to order him dinner off Seamless. He says he'll think about it, but he feels guilty about me spending money on him. I think he deserves it; he works so hard and doesn't really do anything fun for himself, ever. I kiss him goodbye and am out the door. 5:20 p.m. — I'm outside in the freezing wind, and the bus is 10 minutes late! We have a 6:15 reservation, and I'm worried I won't make it to the Upper West Side in time. 5:25 p.m. — Finally, the bus shows up, and I hop on. I text my friend to let her know I'm on my way but stuck in traffic. At the exact same moment, she texts me and says her Uber is stuck in traffic as well. Ha! 5:45 p.m. — Transfer to the red-line train, which of course is running local today due to construction. My friend texts and says she called the restaurant, and they're holding our table for us. 6:27 p.m. — I finally reach my stop and bound out of the station. I make it to the restaurant in time to keep our table, and my friend walks in a minute after me. 6:40 p.m. — It's a sampling restaurant, so we order three plates to share: eggplant, gnocchi, and a caprese salad. Delicious. She orders two glasses of wine over the course of the meal, but I don't drink often, so I abstain. Red wine would make me sleepy, anyway. 7:30 p.m. — The show starts at 8, so we decide we better get going. The check is $77, and we leave a $16 tip. My friend pays with her card since she drank all the wine, and I Venmo her for my portion of the food. $30.50 7:45 p.m. — The line at the theater is insane! There's no way the show is starting at 8 on the dot. Luckily, I printed out our tickets, and we're able to enter through the back door of the theater. We have really great seats and the theater is gorgeous inside. 8:30 p.m. — The show begins. It's really hilarious. I'm glad we came. 9:45 p.m. — We rush out of the theater. So. Cold. My friend looks really sleepy, so she tells me she's going to take a cab home. I walk to the train and text my fiancé to let him know I'm on my way. 10 p.m. — On the train, I check my bank statement and see that my fiancé ordered himself dinner. Good. $13.01 11:35 p.m. — Of course, it took me forever to get home. I change into my sweatpants and cuddle with my fiancé and kitty on the couch. We turn on Netflix and watch . It's entertaining, but predictable, and I fall asleep in the last 20 minutes. 1:30 a.m. — Bed! Daily Total: $53.50",7,135
"7:30 a.m. — I wake up first and take our dog for a morning walk. It's a daily habit, no matter the weather. There's a two-mile trail right behind our house, so we walk that and watch out for moose. There's still about two feet of snow on the ground, but it's melting, so it can be a bit of a slog during this spring break-up phase. 8:15 a.m. — Make a latte at home, bid adieu to my husband, who heads off to work, and settle into my office to start the work day. I work from home as a remote employee. I handle development, strategic planning, and some project management for my employer. Sometimes I take on editing and assessment work for my same employer, and am paid on a separate contract for that, anywhere from an extra $7,000-$20,000 a year. 11 a.m. — I take a break and work out at home. Right now I'm doing . I half-love and half-loathe it, which is my standard reaction to all exercise. It's about 40 minutes long. 11:45 a.m. — I shower, eat some leftover mujaddara I made the previous day, and type out a grocery list on my phone. 12:20 p.m. — I head to the grocery store after responding to a few emails. I buy groceries for the week and come in at what I consider under budget. We tend to spend a lot on food, something I'm always wrestling to reduce. Groceries in Alaska are expensive, but there are always ways to cut back. About four years ago, my husband and I lived in the arctic region of Alaska. In the two villages we lived in, a gallon of milk was $11.50 in one and $16.50 in the other, more remote location. These are villages that are only accessible via plane (small planes), with no roads in or out, so freight costs are astronomical. All this is to say that I can't complain too much now that I'm on the Kenai Peninsula, where it's much cheaper. $122.77 1:15 p.m. — Back at home, I put away the groceries and then pop back into my office to continue working. I sit in on a conference call, finish up a project, and then drift away at about 4 p.m. One of the perks of working from home is the freedom to make my own schedule. I have annual goals I need to meet in my position, but otherwise the work is up to me. 5 p.m. — My husband gets home. He walks our dog again, and I shovel the deck. Snowmelt has been falling off the roof and is creating an enormous, sloppy pile. 6:15 p.m. — I put on some music and make dinner. Tonight it's bibimbap with some ground moose meat that some friends sent us for hosting them for a week. Before Alaska, I lived in Denver, NYC, and Boston, and had never heard of subsistence hunting or fishing. Now it's a big part of our lives, and helps keep our freezer stocked. I don't like to hunt, but I like processing the meat and I enjoy fishing. We usually have moose, caribou, geese, halibut, rockfish, and salmon in our freezer at all times. Half of the meat/fish is from friends who share with us. 8 p.m. — We catch up on on HBO (using my parents' account, like classy millennials), and then I read for an hour or two before bed.

"7:30 a.m. — I walk the dog and then work out right after. (Jillian Michaels again.) 9:30 a.m. — I'm settled at my desk with a latte and yogurt. I have lots to accomplish on my to-do list, so I burn through about three hours of work before taking a break. 12:45 p.m. — The siren call of Amazon pulls me near, and I end up ordering a face mask, Le Puy green lentils, and two books. $29.31 4:30 p.m. — I stop working for the day. My husband gets home, and we pack up the dog and take her down for a long beach walk. We live at the top of a hill, but it's only a 10-minute drive to the beach. It's low tide, and we meander for about two miles before heading back to the car. 8 p.m. — For dinner, we eat leftovers (mujaddara and bibimbap) and watch old episodes of on Hulu. Daily Total: $29.31",2,136
"7:30 a.m. — Once again, I walk the dog and work out again. (Yes, Jillian Michaels — but this time I switch it up with ) 9 a.m. — I browse the Personal Finance Reddit, which is sort of a guilty and nerdy pleasure. I'm not really into FIRE or anything (MMM gives me hives), but I do like to read about personal finance topics and make sure I'm staying on track with my own goals. 11 a.m. — Meetings in different time zones for a couple hours. I graze on carrots, an apple, half a chocolate bar, three clementines, and two weird meatballs that I think have been in the fridge for over 10 days. They smell fine, so I take the risk of ingesting them. (Spoiler alert: It all works out.) 5 p.m. — I stop working and do some deadlifts in the garage, where my husband keeps his free weights and our squat rack. I listen to Tove Lo and do high-knees in between sets to stay warm, since the garage is unheated and my car thermostat says it's 44 degrees in here. 7 p.m. — My husband and I decide to go to dinner and meet some friends. We head to a local bar and I eat a spicy halibut sandwich and fries, and swill two margaritas. We tend to go out to eat once a week, and we'll spend anywhere from $25 to $150 on the meal. This one clocks in at $85.82 with tax and tip. $85.82 Daily Total: $85.82",3,136
"7:30 a.m. — I walk the dog but skip an additional workout today. My hamstrings are killing me thanks to all the Jillian Michaels-induced leaping and heavy deadlifts. 8:30 a.m. — I sit at my desk with my latte and browse Into the Gloss, Cup of Jo, and some minimalist blogs I read (but in no way adhere to) and check out a local calendar of events. Someone is offering fencing lessons at the local high school, and I am intrigued by the sudden vision of myself as an Olympic-level fencer with graceful footwork and killer blonde hair that tumbles from the mask after I remove it. (I happen to be a brunette, so this reverie makes zero sense.) I call the number and sign up for a class next week. Might as well try it, right? I'll pay in cash next week. 9:15 a.m. — I start working in earnest and vow to get a huge project finished. When I have a big project to complete, I tend to work in marathon-like spurts where I'm laser-focused. This is one of those days. I barely look up until 3:30 p.m. 3:45 p.m. — I decide to quit for the day. I inhale a yogurt and some walnuts (starving!), and then head down the hill to pick up four library books I placed on hold. I read about 160 books each year, and this year I'm trying to procure at least 60% of those books at the library. Last year I spent almost $1,600 on books, and I told myself I am not allowed to do that this year. I actually like supporting the publishing industry, but $1,600 seems excessive... I'm limiting myself to $700 in books this year, which is still probably a lot to most people. 4:15 p.m. — I crack open one of the library books and am absorbed until my husband gets home around 5:30. 6:15 p.m. — I sit on the board for a local nonprofit organization, and we have a monthly board meeting. We're working on a big CIP project, and I'm spearheading the logistics, as I completed a similar project last year for my employer when I was our organization's interim COO for 10 months. My employer asked me to stay in the role permanently, but it would have required relocating and going to the office daily. I like the freedom that working from home provides me, so I declined the offer. I did walk away from a larger annual salary ($121,000 — good jobs for MFA graduates do exist!), but it was the right decision for me. Anyway, the experience in operations has been a big asset since I joined this board six months ago. The meeting goes for about two hours, and I drink four cups of hibiscus tea. 8:45 p.m. — I go home, and my husband has dinner ready — pasta with sun-dried tomatoes, kale, and homemade caribou sausage. I eat way too much (pasta is my weakness) and then roll around on the couch while watching HBO. 11 p.m. — I start reading again and stay up until 1 a.m., almost finishing one of my library books. My husband is also up late, working in his studio. He's off from his part-time job for the next few days, and he's entering his natural night-owl mode. Daily Total: $0",4,136
"7:30 a.m. — It's Friday, and I start the day with my usual routine of walking the dog, working out, and making a big ol' latte. 8:45 a.m. — I get to work and stay focused until 1 p.m. I work with my employer's travel coordinator to line out some upcoming work trips. I have meetings with some of our usual funders, a new lead in Seattle, and a conference in Denver in the next couple of months. All expenses will be paid by my employer. 1:30 p.m. — My husband and I head to a local coffee shop and get an afternoon snack. I order chai and he has a latte. We discuss upcoming domestic trip plans, and argue about whether to go to Italy or Norway later this year — or neither. Two different sets of friends have invited us on two different international trips, and we don't agree about what to do. We also talk about whether we want to buy a house, something we go ‘round and ‘round about. In the last 10 years, we have moved every two to three years. Our families are spread across the lower 48. We love Alaska, but are never sure where we want to settle. So this conversation has all the familiar, well-worn verbal paths of a repetitive discussion that ends up nowhere. $13.50 3:30 p.m. — We run errands around town, and I answer emails on my phone. I debate whether I want to schedule a massage. My health insurance covers 80% of the cost of a massage, and I'm allotted 45 sessions a year. This is something I've been trying to take advantage of, but I'm terrible at actually going. We spend money at an auto parts store, buying odds and ends for my husband's 1998 SUV, which he's an ace at fixing. $43.67 5:30 p.m. — We walk the dog together, and then my husband vacuums while I do some pre-weekend laundry. 7:30 p.m. — I make dinner (spicy rockfish tacos), and we watch a movie — that a friend gave us. I'm not usually an aliens person, but I like it! 11 p.m. — After a few glasses of wine, I drag my husband into an impromptu dance party. He rolls his eyes, but we hop around for about 45 minutes before pouring a glass of scotch each (Caol Ila; if you like super-smoky scotch, this will be your jam), and putting on a Ali Wong's comedy special on Netflix, which I've seen three times and adore. Daily Total: $57.17",5,136
"9 a.m. — I wake up late and walk the dog. I do some compound weightlifting (deadlifts, squats, etc.) in the garage for about 45 minutes. Then I pounce on my husband to wake him up. He is the type that still views anything before 10 a.m. as “early.” I make us lattes, and we sit on the deck and stare out at the bay. 11 a.m. — The sad state of our produce drawer makes me realize I need to put together another grocery list soon, and that it's still winter here. We have a farmer's market in town for three months in the summer, and the produce is amazing. I'll be glad when June arrives and we can buy local kale, romanesco broccoli, and more. 12 p.m. — We have leftover tacos for lunch and then head into town to stroll around. We call it ""running errands,"" but we don't buy anything; we just want to be out and about, and go for a drive. One thing I miss about living in a city is the ability to walk everywhere. I love our rural location for the beauty, the slower pace of life, and the hiking trails, but I do miss being able to pop in to a bodega or walk to the bar in the evening. 2 p.m. — I realize my car is low on gas and fill it up. It's a 2004 SUV with a V8 engine, so its main purpose in life is to eat gas, but I love it, as it's reliable, great in bad winter conditions, and really low mileage for a 2004. Since I don't commute for work, I don't have to fill up very often, which is a blessing, as the total always clocks in over $60. $66.40 4 p.m. — I update my budgeting spreadsheets (usually I do this every few days) and check my credit card activity online. The monthly charge for Hulu, $11.99, has posted. 4:45 p.m. — My husband and I take an afternoon nap, and then go on a hike with the dog. I need to get back in backpacking shape for the summer, as we have a few trips planned that will involve carrying a 40-pound pack for about 30 miles over a couple days. I tell myself I'll start training in mid-April, when there's less snow on the ground. 7 p.m. — We debate whether to go out to dinner and/or to join some friends at the bar, but we aren't really feeling it. Since we already went out to dinner once this week, I nix the idea and rummage around for recipes. We end up having baked lemon-garlic halibut with a side of roasted chickpeas and sweet potatoes. Fish is always my default when I have no idea what to make. 8 p.m. — We rent and watch a documentary called and head to bed around midnight. $4.99 Daily Total: $71.39",6,136
"8:30 a.m. — I walk the dog and then dash out the door to meet some friends for coffee. 9 a.m. — The coffee shop is busy, and I have a cappuccino and biscotti. I have a gift card, so I don't end up paying anything out of pocket. 11 a.m. — I drop off two library books I've finished, and then meet my husband at the beach for a walk with the dog. Since it's the weekend, the beach is replete with lots of adorable dogs running around. Our dog just turned 17 and is in great shape (we adopted her when she was 12), but she sticks close when she starts to get overwhelmed by all the young whippersnappers. 1:30 p.m. — We head home and eat lunch, scrounging around for leftovers and quick eats. I make a mental note to go to the grocery again tomorrow. Otherwise, it's a lazy afternoon — we sit and read magazines and books, and catch up with family through a series of FaceTime calls. 6 p.m. — My husband heads to his studio to work on a project. He just got a big art commission that will pay him $18,500. Since his commissions are sporadic, I don't count that as reliable income when I'm budgeting. Instead, a portion is set aside for taxes, and the rest is divided into different savings accounts. While he's working, I check my calendar to see what's coming up for the next week. I pour a glass of wine and start fiddling with some of my own creative writing. 8 p.m. — I make grilled cheese sandwiches and defrost some homemade tomato soup for a simple dinner. We eat together, and then my husband goes back to work, and I do a series of face masks while watching some shows he doesn't like. 10:30 p.m. — I head to bed earlier than usual since I have a busy week ahead, and read for half an hour. Daily Total: $0",7,136
"7:15 a.m. — I wake up and go upstairs to take the child I nanny to school. (Most of my time and care is spent on the family's youngest child, but he has siblings.) The parents always have an extra cup of coffee waiting for me. Once he's dropped off, I go down to my apartment to have some fruit for breakfast. 11 a.m. — I'm trying to save money to move to New York, so I'm working as hard as I can to make meals at home. To save money, I try to spend $0 at least one day a week; sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. I have some sweet potatoes in the fridge, and I put those in the oven for lunch. I also make some lentil dal with coconut milk and a lot of veggies. This keeps well in the fridge and will be good for lunch this week. 12 p.m. — About two months ago, I spent $99 for three months of unlimited classes at a yoga studio using an intro offer. I try to go two to three times a week. It's about a mile away, so I walk to the noon hot pilates class. It kicks my butt! 8 p.m. — A good friend of mine has moved from Washington, D.C. back to the Bay Area where we both went to college. I'm letting her stay with me while she finds housing (a difficult thing to do here right now). She generously treats us to dinner at a Himalayan restaurant near my place. I get a pea and potato curry with rice and naan, and take half of it home for lunch tomorrow. Daily Total: $0",1,137
"7:15 a.m. — While getting the kids ready for school, I snag a cup of coffee. After my morning duties are done, I go back to my apartment and eat the leftover Himalayan food from last night for breakfast. It's so good! 11:15 a.m. — There's a bakery co-op two blocks from my house, so on my way to a hot yoga class, I pick up some baguette pieces, a loaf of bread, and some English muffins. They are still warm and I can't resist having one while I'm walking. $6 1:30 p.m. — My hot yoga class gets out late, so I have to rush home and quickly get ready before I pick the kiddo up from school. When we get home, I warm up the sweet potato/dal combo from yesterday and feed the kiddo a snack from the cabinet. 6:30 p.m. — It's a really beautiful, warm day outside, and my friend who is staying with me suggests we go out for a drink after I'm off nanny duty. We meet at the restaurant where I work. I get 50% off food when I'm not working, and it's an expensive place. We sit outside on the patio and chat for a while over chips and guacamole, quesadillas, and margaritas. My coworker graciously comps our drinks so we only have to pay for the little food we ordered. $10 Daily Total: $16",2,137
"7:15 a.m. — I grab coffee at home while getting the kiddos ready for school. Once they're dropped off, I head home and eat some bread I bought from the co-op and drizzle olive oil on top. 9 a.m. — I work seven days a week, so I try to rest and relax as much as possible on my off-hours. I have a second breakfast of an English muffin with avocado, and make a giant kale smoothie with fresh-squeezed grapefruit, spinach, frozen mango, and banana. I do some reading while I'm eating. 12 p.m. — I usually volunteer at a grocery cooperative once a week for two hours, but my shift got canceled this week because the college where it's located is on spring break. With this extra time, I head to a bookstore near my job to try and sell some of my books. I've been inspired by the minimalist lifestyle and am slowly minimizing my own possessions. I get $17 from my books. I find a fairly recent book that I've been wanting to read, so I spend $12 of that and pocket $5. I still have a few hours before my shift starts at the restaurant, so I decide to walk around and read some. 1 p.m. — I head to Blue Bottle with my new book, which I am really excited to start. (I was an English major in college, and I love when a book excites me!) The barista and I start a conversation about my plans to move to NYC in a few months, and he gives me my cold brew for free. I throw a little cash in the tip jar. I'm convinced the nice weather makes people nicer! $1 1:45 p.m. — A coworker of mine who is about to move to Mexico meets me at Blue Bottle. We walk over to meet an old coworker of ours for pizza and drinks. I get a slice and a vodka-St. Germain cocktail, throw my remaining cash from the bookstore into the tip jar, and the three of us talk about life in the restaurant industry. My job can be stressful at times, but the people are the best I've ever met. I say goodbye and walk into work a little tipsy. Oops. $12 8:30 p.m. — I get off of work a little bit early and decide to splurge and order some of our butternut squash and jalepeño soup for dinner. I also get a few servings of the black rice. We aren't a vegetarian-friendly restaurant, so when we have good vegan stuff on the menu, I splurge. They provide us with a free ""family meal"" before the restaurant opens — a buffet-style dinner — but I'm usually hungry when my shift is over. I head home and eat some rice and beans. $10 Daily Total: $23",3,137
"7:15 a.m. — I start my day with coffee from the family I nanny for. They are very generous with their food and other household stuff, so I also grab some toilet paper and cotton pads from their stash since I'm out in my apartment downstairs. For breakfast I have a leftover English muffin from the bakery. 10 a.m. — Some family friends who I babysit and dog-sit for have just had a new baby. Their dog is having a rough time, so they ask me to come over and walk her. I take a Lyft over there. $5 11 a.m. — After walking the dog, I get to meet the new baby. She is precious! I take a Lyft back to my apartment. $4 11:30 a.m. — Once I get home, I eat some soup and rice left over from work last night and lie in bed and read my book. I can't put it down! 3 p.m. — I'm trying to get the kiddo out of the house after school. There's a new interactive exhibit at the Berkeley Art Museum, so he and I walk together and meet our neighbors, who have kids the same age, there. We munch on hummus and crackers on our way over. I still have my student ID from a year ago, when I graduated, so I use that and get us in the museum for free. 7 p.m. — After my nanny shift is done, I head to a donation-based Vinyasa yoga class. It's just what I needed. I drop my last remaining cash in the donation jar on my way out. $2 9:30 p.m. — When I get home from yoga, I shower and eat the rest of my lentil dal from earlier in the week for dinner. I finish my book, start listening to the new S-Town podcast (it's so good!), and head to bed. Daily Total: $11",4,137
"7:15 a.m. — While I'm getting the kid ready for school, I snag a baguette and coffee from the kitchen for breakfast. I take the kiddo to school and walk the family dog. 9 a.m. — I have really bad anxiety, and I've found that acupuncture treatments really help alleviate it. I take a Lyft ($5) to my acupuncture appointment. It's communal acupuncture, meaning you're often in a room with other people who are receiving treatment, so the costs stay low. I only pay $25 per session. It's pure bliss. $30 12:30 p.m. — After my acupuncture appointment, I take a Lyft to the YMCA. I do some weights and stretching and then walk home. I eat some roasted potatoes for lunch, and make a kale smoothie after I've showered. $5 1:30 p.m. — I grab the last bunch of books I've wanted to sell and walk to the bookstore. I make $8 for my stash...and spend $8 on a book by Donna Tartt that someone recommended to me. 2 p.m. — I walk to the Blue Bottle by my job and grab a cold brew. I sit in the window and read before heading in for my shift. $4 4:30 p.m. — For family meal at the restaurant, they feed us a big salad and some rice. There's chicken, too, but I don't eat meat, for which all of my coworkers make fun of me. 10 p.m. — I order some rice and beans, and chips and guacamole for my break snack. It's mellow for a Friday at the restaurant, but it's still nice to sit down and eat something. $5 11 p.m. — As I'm getting ready for bed, I read about this website that provides free vibrators for people who want or need one, in an attempt to close the orgasm gap. I'm all about that, so I head to the website to see if it's true. It is! I order one of their free vibrators, and another one that's $8. Even with shipping, it's still a really good deal. I'm excited for them to get here! $12 Daily Total: $56",5,137
"10 a.m. — I wake up late and make some coffee. My friend who is staying with me wants to go to San Francisco for the day. We stop at a café near the BART station for breakfast, and I order polenta with mushrooms and a cold brew. Despite my protests, my friend picks up the check. 12 p.m. — I load up my Clipper transportation card and we manage to just make the train to SF without having to wait. We transfer to the Muni (the cable cars in SF) and get off near Haight/Ashbury to do some shopping. $7 2 p.m. — After no luck in our favorite vintage store, we head to a nearby Whole Foods to use the bathroom (there are next to no public restrooms in SF) and get a snack. I get some raw sprouted cookies and an apple, and we sit in the sun outside and wait for a friend to join us. $5 3 p.m. — We head to Crossroads on Haight, where I find a really nice lilac pleated skirt. It's perfect for a day like today. I say farewell to my friends and head back downtown toward East Bay to get to work on time. $14 4 p.m. — I reload my Clipper card and get off in downtown Berkeley just in time to make it to the ""family meal"" at work before my shift starts. I can only eat the salad today, unfortunately. My boss is mad because we all pranked him for April Fool's Day and told him we weren't coming into work, but I get a good laugh out of it. $5 11 p.m. — On my break, I eat some rice and beans and snack on leftover chips and guac. We get to buy any of the wines we sell at the restaurant for wholesale price, so before I leave, I get a nice bottle of red to take home. $13 Daily Total: $44",6,137
"9 a.m. — I wake up and make a cup of coffee to drink while I read in bed. I've been such a bookworm this week! Once I get up, I continue reading and meal prep for the week: rice and dahl with lentils, coconut milk, zucchini, kale, and tomatoes. My produce delivery came yesterday, so I want to use as many veggies as possible. 1 p.m. — I head downtown for another coffee before work. A friend calls me to chat about a writing project we're working on. I grab a seat in Blue Bottle and eat a pretzel with my cold brew before heading into work. $8 4:30 p.m. — The family meal is good today: a cold bean-and-veggie salad with greens and rice. One of the restaurant's investors drops off some chocolate peanut butter bars, and I help myself to a tiny piece. 9 p.m. — I stop at the grocery store on my way home from work. I pick up some organic canned coconut milk, cans of tomatoes, and sesame oil for the week. $10 10 p.m. — After I get home, I watch an episode of (this season has been so disappointing), and the season finale of with a glass of wine.

I feel bad about being mean to my BF this morning and text him that I'm sorry for freaking out at him. He responds that he understands, tells me he loves me, and bids me a good day at work. The Boyfriend Of the Year prize should go to this man for putting up with me. 9 a.m. — After catching up on email and news, I head down to our cafeteria for some breakfast. I decide to skip the order line and go to the breakfast bar where I get a sausage patty and some scrambled eggs with spinach and tomatoes. $2.46 12:30 p.m. — Getting hungry but also feeling tired, I head to La Colombe for a cup of coffee ($2.50 + $1 tip) and then to Sweetgreen for a salad ($11.27). While I wait in the never-ending line, I set up appointments to see a few apartments downtown. $14.77 7:45 p.m. — I make it home and I have a massive headache, so instead of going to the gym like I planned, I turn on Netflix and watch the new season of . My BF recently changed jobs and now works in TriBeCa instead of Midtown. His commute to work has gone from 15 minutes to more than an hour — not great for someone who already works about 15 hours a day. I start to get hungry and realize that I forgot to eat dinner. I'm tempted to order something from Seamless, but then I suck it up and make soup with veggies and Vietnamese beef meatballs I have in my fridge. Daily Total: $17.23",1,138
"7 a.m. — I get to work and quickly read the news before heading to my morning meeting. I'm not very hungry, just tired, so I skip breakfast and drink coffee I brought from home. 9 a.m. — I've been feeling so sluggish, so I decide to book myself a Barry's Bootcamp class for this Friday. Booking the class ahead of time makes me accountable and forces me to go, plus Friday is Full Body day. I book directly through the website instead of through ClassPass because ClassPass only offers a limited number of spots at select times for only some studios — and the time and location I want are booked up. $35.53 11:30 a.m. — I get hungry from not eating breakfast, so I pull on my rain boots and brave the pouring rain to find food. I start heading to Hale and Hearty for soup, but I end up going to Open Market instead. I hit up the hot food bar and get myself some broccoli, mushrooms, a piece of grilled chicken, and a few pieces of shrimp. My eyes wander towards the fried chicken, but I walk away before I have a chance to cave. I have a tendency to get carried away when I have too many options. $8.59 4 p.m. — Walk around the corner to see an apartment real quick, and on my way back to the office I stop at a café for an afternoon pick-me-up. I order a skim milk cappuccino and get the beautiful almond croissant staring at me. $10.94 8 p.m. — I finally get home. After seeing six different apartments today, I am exhausted and cooking is out of the question. I order Thai boat noodles from a place around the corner and add on chive pancakes to meet the delivery minimum. I am leaving my apartment. $22 8:30 p.m. — As I'm waiting for my food, I look through my spring FabFitFun box that just arrived. I love the items that came in the spring box. I have a quarterly subscription, and they auto-charged my card ($49.99) last week. 9:30 p.m. — My parents call me and tell me they need to renew their small-business license, but they don't know how to navigate the site. I tell them I'll take care of it, and I log onto the website and pay for the renewal myself. My mom told me to call her back for her credit card number, but I decide to pay for it with my card. It seems like a small thing to do in light of all they have given me. Plus, every time I go home, my parents always throw money at me even if I don't want it. $308 Daily Total: $385.06",2,138
"5:30 a.m. — My alarm goes off but I snooze for a bit before I get up and get ready for work. BF makes me coffee while I am in the shower and puts it in my to-go cup, which is amazing because I probably wouldn't have time to make it myself. Making coffee at home has saved me quite a bit of money these past weeks. I remember reading a Refinery29 article about how millennials spend more money on coffee than they put in their 401(k), and I'm determined not to do the same. 11:30 a.m. — I'm starving by this point because I skipped breakfast. I initially plan on going to Terri's for a vegan sandwich, but then I remember that someone mentioned Groupon has a deal. I go on and buy two $10 certificates for $12. I also have a 50% coupon that I can apply to one of the certificates, so I only pay $9 in total — but after I print them, I realize that I've accidentally bought certificates for the Midtown location, not the FiDi one. Epic fail of the day. After all that, I just decide to go with my coworkers to get a poké bowl ($11.98) for lunch. $20.98 7:30 p.m. — I make it to my barre class at Physique 57 and find out that my ToeSox won't work for this class, so I need to buy full-coverage socks there. I don't ask how much the socks are because I just assume they can't be more than $10. When I get home later and check my email, I find out they cost $14. Still, this is my first time taking a barre class at Physique 57, and I have to say I loved it; I struggled way more than I thought I would. Shout out to Kerrie Schroeder at Physique 57 for making my buns burn and my whole body sore. She has so much energy, enthusiasm, and is just so nice. $14 9:15 p.m. — I'm starving! I see that we still have buffalo wings in the freezer. I pop a few of those bad boys in the oven and take a shower while they bake. I also sautée some Brussels sprouts in olive oil with salt and pepper. I was tempted to order out for dinner, but given that I just bought a pair of $14 socks, I eat my wings and Brussels sprouts in peace. Daily Total: $34.98",3,138
"6 a.m. — I sleep right through my alarm. (Thank god I took a shower last night before bed.) I try to rush getting ready, but I'm so sore that I can't really move that fast. The BF is a bit late, so neither of us has time to make coffee at home. I rush to the subway. 8:15 a.m. — I head to La Colombe to buy coffee since I didn't make any this morning. ($2.50 + $1 tip.) Then I go to our cafeteria to get a muesli bowl with blueberries, strawberries, Greek yogurt, honey, almond milk, and a banana. ($5.25) At this point I'm carrying five different things, and I drop the banana as I'm  getting on the escalator. Banana down! Picking it up is so hard since I'm still sore from barre class and also lack a free hand. $8.75 2 p.m. — Find out the last applicant for the apartment I want didn't pass the application process, so I speed to put my application in. In order for it to be complete, I have to get my BF to do the same. Finally, after what feels like forever, he responds and sends me all his info. I submit all of our documents and pay the application fee for the both of us. $150 8 p.m. — I get home to about 15 people standing outside for a viewing of my current apartment; I let them in and log into work remotely to finish. I order pad see ew and chive pancakes from my favorite Thai place for dinner and continue to work. I'm waiting on an offshore in India to finish up their job so I can go to bed. $23 Daily Total: $181.75",4,138
"5:30 a.m. — I'm up before my alarm because I've been checking my email for confirmation from the offshore all night; I didn't sleep much at all. I email again to find out what is going on and then also email my manager about the situation. I can't call her from my cell phone, because she's in India and my international calling is blocked. 9 a.m. — My issues are finally resolved, and I head down to La Colombe for coffee. I get a small coffee and an almond croissant. $7.25 12:30 p.m. — It is Friday, and that means no meat for Lent. I'm not one to be strict about that, but I decide to go to Terri's for a vegan portobello mushroom sandwich. The cashier tells me they can honor the Groupon I bought earlier in the week, but I don't have the app on my phone, so I decide to use it another day. $12.58 5:45 p.m. — I head to my 6 p.m. SoulCycle class in TriBeCa since I have one class left in the package I bought and need to use it before it expires. I am so tired from not sleeping last night and I really regret booking this class, but I can't cancel it now. The worst part is that I was feeling ambitious and booked a Soul Survivor class, which is 60 minutes instead of the normal 45 minutes. ($3 for shoe rental + $2 for water) $5 7:15 p.m. — I'm exhausted and feel like I'm going to pass out. I walk next door to Whole Foods and wander around the store, not really knowing what to buy. I end up getting ice cream, fruit, cheese, and vegetarian items from the hot food bar. It's an expensive trip given I didn't even really buy anything. $45.76 8 p.m. — I walk to my BF's office to meet him as he's getting out of work. It is raining so hard that my umbrella is barely doing anything to protect me from getting wet. We decide to get a cab home. My boyfriend offers to pay, but I insist since I get triple points for travel on my credit card. (I have $300 worth of travel credit.) $37.80 9 p.m. — For dinner, we have the vegetarian food I bought from Whole Foods, and gnocchi with red sauce we have in the pantry. We watch and eat some of the ice cream I bought. I fall asleep while watching the movie. Daily Total: $108.39",5,138
"12 p.m. — We lose out on the apartment unit we applied for, and head downtown to see a different unit that is supposed to be similar. We like it and decide to put our application towards that unit. Then we head out for brunch. 1:30 p.m. — We're in walking distance of Chinatown and decide to go for dim sum at Jing Fong. The place is packed as usual, but the wait is no more than 15 minutes. We are starving at this point and order a bunch of dishes, about 10 in total. The plates have small portions, but it's more food than either of us could stomach. The cart with the brunch drinks comes around, but we both gave up drinking for Lent so we pass. My BF pays the bill, which only comes out to $45 after tip. 3 p.m. — We stop at an Asian grocery store to pick up stuff for dinner tonight. We get half of  a roasted duck and a bunch of other items. I drank a of tea at dim sum and regret not going to the restroom at the restaurant. I leave my boyfriend to wait in line and go the tea shop around to corner. I buy a Thai iced tea, just so that I can use the restroom. The BF meets up with me afterwards in the tea shop. $3.50 7 p.m. — We eat a dinner of roast duck in bao buns with a side of blanched bok choy. I crack open a fresh, young coconut I picked up today downtown ($2.50); the coconut water is so refreshing! We are both too tired to go out and do anything, so we snuggle up and watch episodes of for the rest of the night. $2.50 Daily Total: $6",6,138
"11 a.m. — I eat some of the overnight oats I made yesterday for breakfast while my boyfriend makes himself eggs and bacon. We make coffee for both of us in the French press. After breakfast, my BF heads downtown to his office to finish some work, and I stay at home and start to pack. After packing up all of our books, I decide to make myself a cappuccino using our espresso machine. I get overwhelmed with packing and do some studying for my CFA instead. 7:30 p.m. — I sautée shrimp and chicken andouille sausage we have in the fridge with fra diavolo sauce. I also make the rest of the gnocchi in the pack we opened from Friday's dinner, and add that to the dish as well. My BF gets home from work just as I'm finishing up. He bought fresh basil from the store, and I top off our dishes with that and shredded mozzarella cheese. Daily Total: $0",7,138
"7 a.m. — I wake up to my boyfriend's dog stepping on my face. I love him, but it's too early. I lounge around in bed and my boyfriend brings me coffee. I bought him a MistoBox subscription for Christmas, and this was his last delivery. So sad; so yummy. 8 a.m. — I decide this is a lazy type of morning. I eat a slice or two of banana bread that my boyfriend and I made last night and continue watching documentaries on Netflix. 11 a.m. — We scrounge around in the fridge for leftovers and settle on half a burrito and some pad Thai. It's still good, even if it's the day after. My boyfriend is meeting up with friends for the afternoon, so I run off to my own apartment where my first BootayBag awaits me. 2 p.m. — My BootayBag is a disappointment. I'm not thrilled with the selection that was sent. I make a mental note to cancel, or to try just one more month; it's hard to decide. While I'm home, I note that the ceiling in the hallway is leaking and call a few repairmen to come take a look. 4 p.m. — My friend stops by for the afternoon, and we catch up over coffee and lunch. There's a nice coffee shop around the corner from my house, even if it is a little pricey. I get a coconut milk latte and a turkey avocado sandwich. I tip a dollar. $14 6 p.m. — During coffee, I decide that it is a that I get a pet. Considering my work schedule, it will have to be a very low-maintenance pet...FISH! We head to the pet store, only to be disappointed at the selection. I grab a few toys for my boyfriend's dog and some treats, too. I don't pay for any of the dog's necessities, so I get to be the fun parent who gives presents. $20 8 p.m. — We determine that a marketplace run is in order after the pet store and spend more than two hours going through clearance items before deciding on the perfect candle to fit my house needs. All of this work involves sniffing 20+ candles until I feel slightly high and my nose stops working. I decide on mint basil, which is heavenly. $5 10 p.m. — We part ways, and I make myself a late dinner. Riced cauliflower with diced vegetables and egg. It tastes similar to fried rice and is very healthy. I smile at myself for making good choices and start entertaining the thought of going back over to my boyfriend's to sleep. He doesn't come to my place much because of his big pup and my apartment not allowing dogs. I don't mind and head over for a sleepover. Daily Total: $39",1,139
"9 a.m. — I sleep in this morning, and it has never felt so good. I eat a cookie for breakfast (because I can) and head back to my apartment for a day's worth of chores. 11 a.m. — I make myself an iced coffee with my Nespresso machine. I stocked up on capsules to get free shipping (it gets me every time), so I try to make coffee at home with very few exceptions. I eat a pre-packed salad from Trader Joe's that is in my fridge and turn on while I clean my kitchen. 4 p.m. — I haul myself to the grocery store so I can be an adult this week with real food. I have to go grocery shopping on the weekends, or else I'm stuck going after I get home from work, which is typically between 8 and 9 p.m. I buy carrots, chicken, kale, radishes, blackberries, strawberries, bananas, pork, cucumbers, zucchini, cauliflower, bell peppers, mango, and RXBARS because they're on sale. $48 5 p.m. — I decide to make myself dinner with these new ingredients and continue to listen to my audiobook (paid for with a credit) that I'm really liking so far. I eat a stir fry consisting of bell peppers, onions, mango, and chicken over riced cauliflower. However, I try to make my own cauliflower rice instead of buying the Trader Joe's prepackaged kind, which ends in a huge fail. I've riced that rice to smithereens. Oops. I'm too tired to clean the kitchen a second time today and feel like taking a nap. 9 p.m. — I go for a long walk and come back to snack on a banana with almond butter and some strawberries before heading to bed. Daily Total: $48",2,139
"6 a.m. — I wake up early to make it into work on time. I have a call at 8 a.m. and my commute is about an hour. I grab a few snacks to hold me over for breakfast: strawberries, an RXBAR, radishes, and carrots. I also leave a key out for the cleaning service because they're stopping by this morning. The property owner pays someone to detail-clean the building every two weeks, and I often pay an additional $25 to convince them to clean a few things in my own apartment as well. $25 12 p.m. — I work at various client sites, which makes for a nice mix. My clients are scattered throughout Utah, and I get to enjoy the perks of the current office space: free lunch! I am sorely disappointed today when I see that it's nachos. I put some rice, beans, and meat on my plate and skip the chips. 9:30 p.m. — I finally get to go home! I drive the hour back and make myself pork zoodles. After the long drive and cooking, I'm exhausted and head to bed. Daily Total: $25",3,139
"6 a.m. — I wake up and head to an Orangetheory class. I've been sick the past two weeks and have not been utilizing my unlimited membership. My legs are going to feel it tomorrow; I can already tell. 8 a.m. — I make a smoothie for breakfast with frozen berries, Macro green powder, orange juice, and spinach, and am in love with my creation. I pack snacks for the day (tomatoes and strawberries) and head to work. 12 p.m. — The client isn't bringing in food today, so my team and I have to fend for ourselves. We have a ""team lunch"" and go to a pizzeria where I get a small calzone and salad. I feel stuffed full of dough and happy because work is covering the cost. 3 p.m. — I'm really feeling my lack of coffee since I opted for a smoothie this morning. I make myself a drip coffee using the client's machines and put some honey in it. It hits the spot, and I gear up to work for the next few hours. 6 p.m. — It's getting late, and I'm hungry again, I'm not leaving work quite yet, so I grab a Fiber One bar from the client's kitchen (they provide a full supply of snackage) and start gearing up for the drive home. 8 p.m. — I pick up my birth control on my way home from work (100% of which is covered by insurance, woot woot!) and head to my boyfriend's house. I sent him a free subscription to Blue Apron, and he received it yesterday, so we decide to make cod stew, which is surprisingly good! I put the leftovers in a container to take home the next day, since the boyfriend is a baby about leftovers. I drink some wine that's already in the fridge and chat with my boyfriend and his roommates before we go to sleep. Daily Total: $0",4,139
"5:45 a.m. — My alarm goes off for an Orangetheory class, and I go back and forth about whether it's worth getting up for. Orangetheory charges a $12 fee for unlimited members who are no-shows, making me realize more and more what a high-maintenance gym I've signed up for. 6 a.m. — I get a flat tire during my drive to class and cannot be more bummed. I call AAA and am informed that they will arrive in about 45 minutes. I feel sad for my car — and for the $12 I now have to pay to Orangetheory. I wait in my car until help comes. As embarrassing as this is to admit, I have no idea how to change a tire. I feel very ""damsel in distress"" and hate being a cliché. $12 7 a.m. — With the spare now on my car, I text my boss and tell him the bad news. Since I work so far away, I have to go get this thing sorted out now; I can't drive around on a doughnut. The tire shop is nice but takes forever. Then it turns out that the damaged tire can't be patched — and that I need to purchase four brand new tires, not just two, because of my all-wheel drive. 8 a.m. — I am starving, and there is a grocery store next door. I get a coconut latte from the Starbucks inside and buy a chocolate cake doughnut because I am an emotional eater. $7 9 a.m. — My car is finished. I get an alignment done in addition to my new tires, and the bill comes to...$911. I whimper on the inside and put it on my credit card, which is APR-free for another three months. I start making a plan to pay that off over those three months, only to leave the shop and realize that my car is out of gas. I spend an additional $40 on gas, making this the most expensive morning of my life, by far. I feel sad and hate how much adulting sucks sometimes. I go home to get dressed for work. $951 12 p.m. — The client is bringing in food today, so although I have only been working since 10:30, I go upstairs to eat. It's a meat-and-rice number with a side salad. 6:30 p.m. — I'm still at work and feel bad leaving after having arrived so late, but my brother is playing at a little venue tonight and I promised that I would go. I leave work and head to the venue, which is right by my house, and then decide to head home after his set. I contemplate going to my boyfriend's house, but I feel too worn out and moody for company. Daily Total: $970",5,139
"8 a.m. — I make it to the gym and back in one piece. These tires make me feel like I'm driving on clouds, or at least that's what I tell myself to rationalize the expense. I make myself another smoothie and put in way too much green powder, so I add a banana. I pack cucumbers, carrots, and an RXBAR and head to get a soy latte. $3 12 p.m. — No catered lunch today, so we head to lunch as a team. My boss pays, and I almost die from choking on a stem of cilantro. I excuse myself and am not really in the mood to eat this salad when I get back to the table. I decide to save it for dinner; hopefully it will keep. 6 p.m. — I eat my salad and it tastes so much better now that my airways are clear! I head into a meeting with my boss, who asks that I stay a little later tonight. 9 p.m. — I leave work and have to decide which house to go to — mine or my boyfriend's. I haven't seen him in a few days, but I'm so tired after the long workday, and I'd like to go to my workout tomorrow. He's not happy about it, but I'm trying to get better at standing my ground with things like this. I eat my chicken-bell pepper creation and take a bath. Daily Total: $3",6,139
"5:45 a.m. — My body wakes up on its own today, and I feel revived and happy. Sleeping in my own bed was such a good choice! Feeling stoked, I get ready to go work out. 8 a.m. — Before I head out, I make another smoothie. I'm out of orange juice, so I put coconut milk in it and go with peaches. This smoothie isn't an epic fail, but it sure doesn't taste as good as the others. I might need to look up some recipes since I'm new to the smoothie game. I grab a banana, almond butter, and an RXBAR. 9 a.m. — I'm on time to work, and today is payday! I quickly distribute my paycheck to rent, car insurance, internet, savings, and my credit card bill. Then I message my friend to see if we're still on for yoga tomorrow. I'm excited for weekend plans, but make a mental note to set aside time to work. If I don't make a plan, then I typically won't follow through. (I get too stoked with all the freedom!) 12 p.m. — The company orders catering today: pasta and Caesar salads — eh. I'm not a huge pasta fan (it doesn't make me feel great), but I eat it anyhow, because it is free. 5 p.m. — Work has dragged today, but luckily, since it's Friday, we get to leave by 5. I opt for this and regret it almost instantly when I end up sitting in traffic for two hours. My boyfriend and I go to dinner with two of his friends. I get a mango margarita, three tacos, and guacamole because I am starved. My boyfriend is feeling generous and pays for the food, so I grab our drinks. $20 (including tip) Daily Total: $20",7,139
"9 a.m. — Wake up, shower, and drive to a quick breakfast at the local Dunkin' Donuts with my boyfriend before he goes to college and I head off to do some hair for my family. 10 a.m. — I get to my grandma's place. She wants me to give her a perm so her hair has some body, along with a facial and a haircut. I haven't seen her in a while and she's recovering from a cold, so I hang out with her for a little while after I'm finished. She gives me $60. 2 p.m. — I get home from my grandma's and pick up my Victoria's Secret package in the mail. They had eight-for-$27.50 panties last week and I have a VS Angel Card and decided to splurge. I make a grilled cheese sandwich for lunch and write a grocery list for myself. Nobody is home yet, so I take the time to clean my room and tidy up around the house a little. I live at home and my ""chores"" for the week include cleaning up the house and making sure our dog and cat have clean food bowls. 5 p.m. — I have another client to do outside of work — my sister's friend's mother. I regularly do her highlights; this time we add lowlights and a haircut. She gives me $75 for the hair, plus $8 for a product I bought her, and $18 as a tip. 9:30 p.m. — After doing her hair, I run back home and pick my sister up to come grocery shopping with me at Wegmans, also known as the Mecca of grocery stores. On the way, we stop at the bank so I can deposit my tips and the extra money I made this week. $323 goes into my account: $163 of that is from tips during the week and $160 is from services today. At Wegmans, I get veggies, yogurt, bread, OJ, milk, eggs, and ice cream. $62 10:30 p.m. — We get home and I put all my things away. I keep track of all the tips and extra cash I get in my calendar, and I take care of that while I watch an episode of before going to bed. Daily Total: $62",1,140
"10 a.m. — Get up, shower, and go to the BF's house. He has a discount on gas at Tops, so we both get some. I pay for both. $70 12 p.m. — We decide to go out to brunch at a local diner in our town. On the way over, we stop at a friend's house to pick up $10 she owes me for getting her a hair product. My boyfriend and I both get omelets at the diner. He treats — $30 total, plus $5 tip — since I bought the gas. 1:30 p.m. — My BF's grandmother was in the hospital recently so we go out to visit her before we both go to work. 4 p.m. — I work from 4 p.m. to 9 p.m. tonight and it's pretty busy. I did 10 haircuts, a color and a wash, and a blow dry. I make $65 in tips and buy a product at work that I'll drop off at a friend's later. She will pay me back when I see her. A coworker's husband brings us a pizza to eat, so I don't have to get anything for dinner. 10 p.m. — I get home from work and get myself ready for Saturday at the salon. I pack lunch and pack my work bag to do a highlight for my sister's friend at her house after work. I pop on again while I get ready, and then go to bed. Daily Total: $88",2,140
"7:30 a.m. — I stay in bed for a little bit until I'm fully awake. In a bit, I finally get up and shower. My mom makes a protein spinach waffle for me, and I eat that with OJ and a banana before finally get myself totally ready. 9:30 a.m. — I get to work a little early to do some computer training before my shift. There's a new video every month for stylists to watch. 2:30 p.m. — I sneak in a break before my 3 p.m. clients arrive and eat chicken salad and yogurt that I brought from home. 6:15 p.m. — I clock out from work and buy a new shave gel and hair mask. We just got new products in our shipment at work and I need to try them. After, I run next door to Sally's to grab a toner for the highlight I have to go do tonight, along with an eyebrow pencil. $31 6:20 p.m. — I stop at the Kohl's in my plaza to drop off the products I bought two days ago for my friend. She gives me the $18 for them. 6:40 p.m. — When I get to the client's house and end up doing a balayage on her hair and cutting her father's hair as well. She pays me $50 and her dad pays $20. 9 p.m. — I get home and eat some mac and cheese from a box we have in the house. I clean up, put away all my supplies, and do a face mask before bed. I count my money: I made $78 in tips from work, $55 from my friend (after tip), $20 from dad, and the $18 back from the friend for the product, so $171 altogether. Daily Total: $31",3,140
"7 a.m. — I wake up and lie in bed for a bit before getting up. I shower and get ready, and then I see that my mom has made me a cauliflower crust breakfast pizza for breakfast. 10 a.m. — Get to work and open the store. Three people are already waiting at the door for us, and I can tell today is going to be crazy. 2 p.m. — I finally take my break, and eat a salad and yogurt from home again, along with some grapes. Then it's back off to work. 5:45 p.m. — It's super crazy at work because it's the day before school; people are coming back from a break, so everyone wants last-minute waxes and haircuts. I leave work and take the night deposit to the bank before going home. 6:15 p.m. — After I get home, I change out of my hairy clothes and go to my boyfriend's house. I ate dinner there (mashed potatoes and broccoli), and then we go out to the plaza where I work to do some shopping together. 9:30 p.m. — I have a couple of coupons to use (plus my mom's employee discount!), so we go to Kohl's where I want to find a few shirts for work. I spend $31 on a sweater dress and a long cardigan. Next, we go to Target, where I spend $58 on a basket, makeup remover, a notebook, face wash, and a phone cord. Finally, we stop at the bank on the way home so I can deposit my tips from today ($74). $89 10 p.m. — I get home and climb into bed where I watch another episode before falling asleep. Daily Total: $89",4,140
"9 a.m. — I'm lazy about getting up today and don't start moving until I shower at 10:45. I do a load of laundry, eat some eggs and toast, and clean the house and my room a little more. (Having a tiny room plus too much stuff means I clean it nearly every day.) 2 p.m. — I lounge around before getting ready for work. I end up spending $15 on the Wish app on for some little things I've been eyeing for a while. I get myself ready for work and eat quickly. I make mini-hot dogs with leftover mac and cheese, and I bring the leftovers with me to work for my lunch. $15 9:30 p.m. — I get home from work. I made $55 in tips today, pretty good for a Monday night shift. I put on and go to bed. Daily Total: $15",5,140
"8 a.m. — I wake up and lie in bed for a few minutes before getting up. Work starts at 12 but I have some things to do beforehand, so I get myself ready and head out. 11:30 a.m. — I go to CosmoProf — a professionals-only store — and end up spending $71 on a few things I need to do clients' hair. (I will get paid back for those products later.) I also need to pick up a few color brushes and hair products for myself. After, I run to Target to buy some craft items for work to decorate our back room. Lastly, I run to a bank to finally close out an account I don't use anymore. $86 4 p.m. — I work at a beauty supply store part-time to save extra money, and they're having a one-day sale on a rolling color cart — buy one, get one free. It is a bigger purchase for myself than I would normally make, but it I think of it as investing in my future. I plan to get a house and build an at-home salon. This brings me one step closer to my dream, and it's perfect for storage for my supplies at home. After my employee discount, it costs $68 for both, compared to the regular price of $83 each. $68 4:15 p.m. — Get my nails done. I don't get them done very regularly, but I have a gift card. $27 (including tip) 5:30 p.m. — I get home and make shrimp Alfredo for dinner with my mom, before prepping my carts until they're perfect. I don't mind the investment I've made in them. 10 p.m. — I watch while I get ready for tomorrow. I'll have a 12-hour day with both jobs, so I don't want to have to run around and forget things. I go to bed right after. Daily Total: $181",6,140
"6:30 a.m. — I wake up, shower, and get ready. I'm up earlier than normal because I need to pick up a coworker before work. She's having car issues and I offered to grab her since she's on the way. 3 p.m. — I've made $40 since I started work at 9 a.m. I eat quickly and change out of my hairy clothes before my second job starts at 4 p.m. 8:15 p.m. — I get out of work and run to Wegmans to grab a few things for my mom and me — more O.J., milk, bagels, frosting, lettuce, dish soap, Q-tips, and cotton balls. $21 9 p.m. — I get home, put the groceries away, and then give myself a hair mask treatment. My hair is super dry, so I'll let it sit overnight. I also do another face mask since my skin is really oily and prone to breakouts. While that sinks in, I make myself a tuna melt with steamed broccoli for dinner. 10 p.m. — I decide to paint my toenails quickly before bed and then take off my face mask. I turn on again until I fall asleep. Daily Total: $21",7,140

Co-pay is $40. 9:45 a.m. — Take a cab from the doctor's office in the Financial District to Soho for work. $12 10:15 a.m. — I eat some office oatmeal and have a leftover iced coffee in the fridge from yesterday for breakfast. Usually I spend way too much money on food and coffee, so this week I am trying to be creative with free food! 12:30 p.m. — I somehow convince my boyfriend to order By Chloe with me for lunch. (We work together!) Used Postmates and put it on his credit card. Score! 6:30 p.m. — Take an Uber back home to the Financial District. $8.07 Daily Total: $60.07",1,141

I received a Nespresso machine for the holidays, and brought an espresso shot from home today. 10:30 a.m. — Feeling a little run down, so my friend picks me up a wellness shot from Pressed Juicery across the street. I pay her back. $2.50 12:30 p.m. — Too lazy to walk outside and get lunch. Order a healthy lunch from Mulberry & Vine on UberEats. $13.88 4:00 p.m. — Purchase a pilates class for next week with a friend. We like to try new fitness studios and classes each week. (It's a new thing — we'll see how long it lasts!) $20.90 7:00 p.m. — Get home from work and order rice and beans from Tacombi using UberEats. $7.24 Daily Total: $44.52",2,141
"8:00 a.m. — We try a new cleaning service today for a ""deep clean"" in our apartment. It costs more than our usual $80 clean. Unsure if it was worth it. $115 12:30 p.m. — Have to stay home sick today (guess that wellness shot didn't work). Make some beans and quinoa that I already had in my pantry for lunch. The rest of the day, I snack on things I have in my apartment. 7:00 p.m. — Eat a veggie burger from my freezer for dinner. Daily Total: $115.00",3,141
9:30 a.m. — Still sick. Sleep most of the day today. I make a smoothie with ingredients I have in my pantry and freezer for breakfast. 12:30 p.m. — Veggie burger from my freezer for lunch! Today is a great saving day. 7:00 p.m. — Order Empanada Mama with my boyfriend for dinner. He pays. Daily Total: $0.00,4,141
"9:30 p.m. — Eat a MacroBar for breakfast and a shot of espresso from my Nespresso machine. 2:30 p.m. — Go to Whole Foods (finally got out of the apartment!) and pick up groceries for the week for my boyfriend and me. I have a $35 gift card from a holiday gift, so I was able to take my purchase total from $81.91 to $46.91. I also brought my own tote bags, which saves another 10¢ per bag. $46.91 6:30 p.m. — Use my purchases at Whole Foods to make dinner and meal prep for the week. Daily Total: $46.91",5,141
"8:30 a.m. — Take an Uber to work with my boyfriend. He pays. 9:30 a.m. — I wake up tired and need something stronger than my at-home Nespresso shot. Pick up a cold brew at By Chloe a few blocks from work. $4.50 12:30 p.m. — Eat black beans, quinoa, lentils, and spinach — food that I meal-prepped yesterday — for lunch. So far so good on saving money on food! 3:30 p.m. — Order new probiotics and a health and nutrition book on Amazon. $52.36 5:30 p.m. — I go for a manicure every two weeks and a pedicure once a month. Since I go to the same salon, I have a loyalty card where you save $10 when you spend $100. I get a manicure and add a 10-minute massage today, and it ended up only being $17 because I receive my $10 off today! I tip my technician $10. (All about giving good tips.) $27.00 7:00 p.m. — Take an Uber home from the nail salon. $9.57 7:30 p.m. — Have a veggie burger, some leftover roasted veggies, and a Kombucha for dinner.

Decide to treat him today! $29.40 3:20 p.m. — I have been splurging on lots of beauty products (I'm a natural beauty fanatic — I love all face oils, masks, makeup, etc.). I wandered into Sephora and came out with an RMS Beauty Oil — something I've been lusting after for so long. I return some makeup I received over the holidays for a store credit, so I only have to pay $57.27 instead of $87. $57.27 6:30 p.m. — Decide to get some exercise and save money by walking home from work. 6:50 p.m. — Boyfriend is craving turkey bacon, so I stop in at Target to pick some up for him on my walk home.

"10:18 a.m. — A friend of mine is performing in a play next month and I'm so excited to see it! I buy tickets for myself and another friend. $30.00 10:30 a.m. — I make turkey bacon and eggs for breakfast. We need to go grocery shopping soon. I am down to just the staples. 12:00 p.m. — I drive down to a rock climbing gym in Virginia. It would normally be too big of an indulgence for me to come to this gym and pay for a day pass, since I already have a gym membership elsewhere. Luckily my family gave me a lot of gift cards for this rock climbing gym over the holidays! I'm hoping to get pregnant soon and want to get in a lot of climbing while I still can. 6:30 p.m. — My little brother stops by to watch football. He is new to the city and has just started an entry-level job at a nonprofit organization. He is looking for an apartment, and I am reminded of how hard it is to find an affordable living situation in D.C. I make a mental note to help him buy some furniture once he gets a place. I cook chana masala for him, my husband, and me. Daily Total: $30.00",1,142
"8:15 a.m. — My husband wakes me up with some delicious breakfast tacos! He's not the most confident cook, so I am very proud of him for taking the initiative and also not burning the kitchen down. 10:00 a.m. — My sneakers' shoelaces are completely shredded. I walk down to the big box store and buy new laces. $3.00 12:30 p.m. — Time for our weekly grocery shopping run. Most of the meals that we cook at home are vegetarian, but we occasionally purchase turkey bacon or chicken. This week, we are buying a lot of produce and yogurt. We received a 10% discount today because we got our flu shots at the store recently. Gotta love the public health incentives! $74 2:00 p.m. — I was supposed to join a friend for lunch, but we got our wires crossed. I eat leftover chana masala and half a pomelo instead. I get a text from a relative who wants to see if I would hire him do my taxes. I'm a bit hesitant to share financial information with family relations, so I make an excuse. I feel a bit guilty though. Hopefully he will find some other clients. 6:15 p.m. — I buy a 15-class pass for my local yoga studio. It's a little painful to shell out this much all at once, but as long as I use all the classes within a year, it will save over $45. I am trying to do some form of exercise six days per week, and my husband has resolved to do more yoga this year. We are able to share the pass. We both head to a 6:30 p.m. class. It's an intense class and totally kicks my butt. $237.40 7:45 p.m. — My husband cooks his signature dinner for us — pasta with tomatoes, mozzarella, and basil. Daily Total: $314.40",2,142
"7;30 a.m. — I make some coffee at home and read a book while I drink. As I head out the door, I grab a yogurt, which I'll eat at the office for breakfast. 12:30 p.m. — After my morning meetings, I am super hungry. I head to the organic supermarket near my work for a lunch of chicken piccata, kale salad, and fruit. I also pick up some groceries that are unavailable at my local grocery store — paneer, bok choy, and bulk spices. $17.76 3:27 p.m. — It's a really slow day at work for me, so I take care of some personal errands. I make a car maintenance appointment and also schedule my annual physical with my primary care doctor. Also, totally TMI, but now that I am exercising more often, I am seeing the value in having sweat-wicking underwear. I buy a three-pack off Amazon for $25. 5:00 p.m. — I head to my gym, where I have a membership, to work out. Afterwards, I drive 30 minutes out of the way to donate some clothes to an organization in Maryland, but no one is there. I'll have to try again soon. 8:30 p.m. — My husband is watching the confirmation hearings for potential Secretary of Education DeVos when I get home. There are a lot of educators in my family, and her lack of knowledge about education is making our blood boil. I'm in no mood to cook, so I just eat the final leftovers of our chana masala. It turns out to not be enough food, because I wake up hungry at 2:00 AM. Daily Total: $42.76",3,142
"7:30 a.m. — I drink some coffee with butter in it because we are out of cream, then I drive down to Virginia to drop my car off at the shop for maintenance, which is a chore that I always struggle to do on time. I'm hoping that I'll be able to get away with just the expense of an oil change and nothing else. 9:00 a.m. — One of the auto shop employees drops me off at the metro station and I ride home. 9:30 a.m. — While I take my morning conference calls, I have a breakfast of yogurt and turkey bacon, but am still feeling hungry. My period is two days late, so there is a possibility that I am pregnant. But I've also only recently started exercising on a daily basis, so I may need to up how much food I eat generally. Throughout the rest of the morning, I snack on pumpkin seeds and popcorn. 12:39 p.m. — I walk over to the library to return some books. I pick up a couple books I had placed on hold: a nonfiction book about physics and a Salman Rushdie novel. The D.C. Public Library is a fantastic system — I haven't had to purchase a book for myself in nearly three years. 1:00 p.m. — I make miso ramen with bok choy and egg for lunch. Afterwards, I snack on a grapefruit. 3:45 p.m. — I take the metro back down to Virginia to pick up my car. In addition to the oil change, I also have to get repairs to the brakes and suspension systems. The District of Columbia has some of the worst roads in the country, which means I'm frequently paying maintenance fees like this. $300 6:00 p.m. — We make some gnocchi with Brussels sprouts and chestnuts for dinner. 7:45 p.m. — I walk down to the local yoga studio for a night time class (paid for with my new 15 class pass). Their dehumidifier stopped working, so it's like a jungle in there! Daily Total: $300",4,142
"7:30 a.m. — We start the morning off with a pregnancy test and it's positive. It's a good thing I had an IUD for the last five years, since turns out we were pretty fertile! I drink coffee, eat yogurt, and try to read, but it's pretty hard to concentrate. My job is super flexible about working remotely, so I decide to work from home and spend the day with my husband. Since his office is inside the security perimeter for the inauguration, he is also working from home today. 9:30 a.m. — We do another pregnancy test just to make sure and then I call my doctor. She wants me to come down to their office today for a confirmatory blood draw. 11:00 a.m. — I almost missed my morning conference calls because I fell down a rabbit hole of looking at different pregnancy sites! This still doesn't feel quite real. I take the metro downtown to my doctor's office. There was no copay for my appointment — not sure if that's because the blood test was considered preventative care by my insurance or if the doctor's office just did it as a courtesy. On my way, I keep seeing cool posters for the Women's March on Washington and learn that they are giving them away for free at a local used furniture store. I make a mental note to go back for some tomorrow. 1:00 p.m. — My husband and I walk to the library and pick up a couple of basic pregnancy books. I have a degree in public health, but all of the different advice on the internet about food, exercise, exposures, etc is overwhelming even for me. I'm hoping a well-trusted book can help me tune out the noise. On our way back, we stop by an organic grocery store and pick up some naan for dinner. $3 2:30 p.m. — Having a baby in this city is going to be expensive. We are fortunate to live pretty comfortably right now and still save up a fair amount of money, but we will have to cut back on a lot of our discretionary spending to afford child care. 6:00 p.m. — We make bhindi masala for dinner. My brother stops by on his way to the grocery store and has a little bit with us. We decide to tell him that I'm pregnant and he seems pretty shocked. Telling someone else is making this whole thing more real. Daily Total: $3",5,142
"8:00 a.m. — It's Inauguration Day, so my husband doesn't have work. I still do, but work remotely again, this time to avoid road closures. He makes us some breakfast tacos. We kick off the start of this new dystopian reality by watching an episode of on Netflix. 10:30 a.m. — While my husband watches the inauguration, I sequester myself in the bedroom for my morning calls and am grateful for the distraction. Eight years ago, we walked down to the National Mall in the freezing cold pre-dawn hours, with a multicultural group of friends. As an ethnic minority, I'm horrified that there are thousands of people in this country who think that I don't belong here, and that there are millions more, including the new president, who are not inclined to stand up for me. 12:00 p.m. — I take the metro down to the furniture store for a free protest poster, but they ran out yesterday. It's a little eerie outside right now — the metro is empty and there are very few people out on the streets. I walk home in the rain. 2:00 p.m. — I start to prepare some slow-cooker chicken enchilada soup for dinner and then I walk over to my best friend's house. I didn't make myself lunch and am pretty hungry, so I pack myself a snack of chestnuts and a grapefruit. When I tell my BFF that I'm pregnant, she immediately steams up some dumplings for me. 7:00 p.m. — My husband and I eat the chicken enchilada soup for dinner and then text with some friends to coordinate our meeting spot for the Women's March on Washington tomorrow. We watch live coverage of a few anarchists protesting downtown who have lit some trash cans on fire. I'm glad that the more violently-inclined protesters are marching today and not tomorrow, since I think they make the rest of us look bad. Daily Total: $0.00",6,142
"7:30 a.m. — We wake up early for t he Women's March on Washington and eat a breakfast of yogurt, tea, and bananas. 8:00 a.m. — We check Twitter to see how crowded Metro is, and trains are already at capacity, so we walk about three miles downtown instead. Even this far north, we see tons of pink-hatted people making their way downtown. 11:00 a.m. — We can't hear anything at the rally, so we take a quick break at my husband's office since it is right by the mall. We warm up, eat a few free office snacks, and watch some streaming video of the speakers. 12:00 p.m. — We stop at a sandwich shop for a quick lunch before rejoining the March. We spend the rest of the afternoon at the mall alternating between marching and chanting with the crowds and trying to catch a break from the mass of people. It's amazing to see all these people, who came from all over the country, streaming onto the Mall, with the metro escalators constantly depositing more and more people. $4.30 3:30 p.m. — We are feeling a bit overwhelmed by all the people so we start to walk home. Once we walk about a mile north, we are able to catch a bus home. 5:00 p.m. — One of my good friends is hosting a potluck brunch tomorrow as a follow-up to the Women's March and she has asked her guests to bring toiletries and other items, which she will donate to a local homeless shelter. I stop by the grocery store to pick up ingredients for my dish and items to donate. I end up buying a sandwich for a homeless person outside the store as well. $20 7:00 p.m. — We eat the leftover chicken enchilada soup and scroll through social media to see news from our friends. Nearly everyone we know marched today, either in D.C. or in their home cities. In addition to this election being personal to me because of my ethnicity, my new pregnancy has brought up a lot of issues that were once only abstract to me. All of a sudden, there are people who think that the government is more fit to control my body than I am, and that thought scares me. Daily Total: $24.30",7,142
"11 a.m. — Every Saturday morning I walk to my local Brooklyn bagel shop, and I get two bagels with bacon, egg, and cheese and coffee for me and my boyfriend. Our Saturday morning tradition since we first started dating has been bagels and watching DVR'ed episode of from the night before. $8.98 1 p.m. — We head to the TKTS booth for discounted tickets, but we don't see any shows we like, and it begins to snow. We hide out in Starbucks while we decide if we should trek to Times Square or not. I order some new butterscotch coffee drink. (It's delicious.) $5.00 3 p.m. — Buy tickets for on Broadway at the box office in Times Square. The show ends this week, and my boyfriend ""needs"" to see it. His birthday is three days away, so this is the perfect birthday activity. I only pay for my own ticket, though, because I've already spent too much on him. $99.00 6 p.m. — We head to my girlfriend's new apartment and decide to check out the Indian restaurant she lives above. I order naan for the table, mango lassi, and chicken tikka masala. The food is all delicious, and I have plenty leftover to eat later on when I get hungry again. $12.52 Daily Total: $125.50",1,143
"12 p.m. — My boyfriend's best friends agree to come into Midtown to celebrate his birthday early with a boozy brunch. The deal is two-hours unlimited drinking plus an entree. It was my idea, so I decide I should pay for the both of us. $72.97 4 p.m. — We somehow end up in Hoboken, and I am bitter that my unlimited Metrocard does not count when traveling to Jersey, so drunk me jumps the turnstile. (Sorry.) We order drunk food at a friend's apartment, and I somehow end up not paying for it. 7 p.m. — We take the NJ Path back to the city but accidentally take it to Union Square, which brings us right to a fro-yo store. Drunk me cannot resist frozen yogurt. I am extremely disappointed when its not self-serve, and I convince the nice worker to give me more toppings than allowed. $6.50 Daily Total: $79.47",2,143
"10 a.m. — I announce that I bought my boyfriend tickets to see for his birthday. I wake up early to make us both breakfast, since the show is at 2:00 p.m. We usually do Broadway shows as presents since it is more of an activity for both of us. I make us eggs and frozen pancakes from Trader Joe's. Then we use our unlimited MetroCards to head uptown. 130 p.m. — I refuse to spend any money at this overpriced theater, so we stop in a CVS so I can buy a lollipop to suck on during the show. I don't mind shelling out big bucks for big productions, but I refuse to spend $12 on a themed drink. $1.00 5 p.m. — We head to Bed Bath and Beyond to buy some much needed home items. We are constantly running out of silverware, so I buy a thing of forks. I also decided to start cooking more in the new year, so I buy these cute rainbow-colored mixing bowls. My roommate is going to love them. $25 6 p.m. — We go to Basta Pasta, a fancy Italian spot I've been dying to try. I thought it would be a nice special place for post- birthday celebrations. I'm being way too nice this birthday because I got a promotion. I get spaghetti served out of a wheel of cheese, and we both get wine and our own desserts. $88.04 Daily Total: $114.04",3,143
"10 a.m. — We both took the day off of work since today is my boyfriend's actual birthday. It's nice having a super-long weekend between the day we took off and the day we both got off for MLK Day. We head to our bagel shop once again to get a quick BEC because we are spending the day at the Museum of Natural History. $8.98 11 a.m. — We buy student tickets at the Museum of Natural History and also pay for two extra exhibits, the butterfly zone and the planetarium. They are both worth it, and we have a very full day of fun activities. My boyfriend pays for the museum tickets after I spent way too much on him over the long weekend. 1 p.m. — We get too hungry to wait any longer, and we decide to eat in the museum. It is the worst sandwich I have ever had, and I can only finish half of it. I am so mad at myself for thinking maybe roast beef would be a safe bet. I should have brought food with me like my mom raised me to do. $11.43 5 p.m. — We go to Rolf's, a fun German place fully decorated during Christmas time with lights everywhere. The location is cool, but I cant stop thinking about the place burning down due to all the decorations. We split the bill and only order appetizers. This place is crazy overpriced. $20 7 p.m. — We are seeing tonight, and, once again, I will not be buying anything at the theater, so we stop at a CVS and I get Skittles and a Ring Pop. They are perfect snacks to have during a show and won't be too noisy to eat. $3 8 p.m. — I almost buy myself a silly souvenir at the show because I'm a sucker, but end up spending no more money for the rest of the night. We use our unlimited MetroCards to go to Times Square and back home to Brooklyn. My boyfriend declares he has had the perfect birthday and ""I'm the best."" Daily Total: $43.41",4,143
"9 a.m. — I'm back at work and back on my normal schedule. I start the day by drinking the coffee and milk provided at the office and eat a Trader Joe's yogurt that I keep in my work fridge. 12 p.m. — I go to a sandwich spot next to my office, and get a brie and prosciutto sandwich. There is a discount if you work in my building, which takes off about a dollar, I always make sure to mention it. I also have a pastry that was brought in by a client — a nice benefit of working in advertising. $6.80 6 p.m. — I make a chicken dinner with green beans for me and my boyfriend, using all ingredients we already have in the house. The meal is just okay. I've been trying to force myself to eat vegetables, and it is not going too well. I quickly finish my dinner, so I can move on to eating cereal (my actual favorite meal). Daily Total: $6.80",5,143
"9:30 a.m. — I get to work late and so does my work friend. She mentions wanting a bacon, egg, and cheese, but I promised myself I wouldn't spend more money on breakfast for the rest of the week. I finally decide I will get crazy jealous if she gets one and I don't, so I go back out and buy a BEC that I do not deserve. $6 12 p.m. — I head over to my friend's office to visit her at work. I borrowed a copy of from her roommate last weekend and need to return it. He is a member of SAG and got sent copies of all the nominated movies, which I have been heavily borrowing in time for Oscar season. After I leave her office, I stop at Pret a Manger to get myself a chicken-and-bacon sandwich and a clementine. This is clearly a good day for bacon. $8.69 7 p.m. — I decide to make another chicken dinner tonight, since I did not like last night's meal. This time, I'm making my favorite chicken dish that does include vegetables. I head to the grocery store below my building to buy white wine and rice. I stop in CVS as well to see if they have any sales on cereal or ice cream, but both are full price. I can't justify spending $6 on Ben and Jerry's, so I sadly head back upstairs to cook. $7 Daily Total: $21.69",6,143
"9 a.m. — I start my morning with coffee from work and a Trader Joe's yogurt. 1 p.m. — My company is moving offices, so my coworkers and I decide to go to our favorite Thai place one last time. We split the bill. $12.50 4 p.m. — My coworker whips out an order form for Girl Scout Cookies. It's my favorite time of year once again! I buy eight boxes for my whole apartment. My two roommates Venmo me for their boxes, and I decide to be nice and cover the boxes my boyfriend wants, mostly so I can eat his cookies without feeling bad. $16.00 Daily Total: $28.50",7,143
"8:45 a.m. — I'm moving slowly this morning because of a stomachache (likely from eating hot wings last night) and dry throat (from Colorado's arid climate). I'm able to take it easy this a.m., as most of my company's permanent employees are on a retreat. (I am working on a short-term contract.) So instead of rushing out the door, I drink some coffee with my boyfriend, throw cereal and milk into a Mason jar, and grab some random snacks for lunch. 11:45 a.m. — Snack on a banana that I brought to work, but half of it is too mushy to eat. Now I know I NEED to stop for groceries on the way home. 1 p.m. — I consider going out for a bowl of soup, but decide to get by on the snacks I brought. I have snap pea crisps (amazing), some cheese, and a Fiber One brownie. As I'm eating lunch, I peruse job boards and send off some networking emails. My job contract is ending soon, so I need to figure out what to do next. 5 p.m. — I'm crashing hard today, so I make the decision to hit up Costco first on my grocery trip. (Free samples!) I quickly visit the sample stands, and get to shopping. Much easier to navigate this store on a weeknight than on the weekend. I try to only purchase $50 worth of food, but I end up with a few extras. $68.45 5:45 p.m. — I head next door to Target to fill in the gaps. I use a Redcard and Cartwheel to make grocery shopping at Target as reasonable (if not slightly more reasonable) than the traditional grocery stores. My boyfriend and I usually split groceries pretty evenly, but lately it has made most sense for me to stop on my way home from Denver. Either he will cover the next round, or more likely, he will spring for some meals and drinks when we go out. $54.39 6:30 p.m. — Finally arrive home! I had told my boyfriend how exhausted/hungry I was before I did the grocery shopping, so he brought home some meals from his work cafeteria. He gets them subsidized and deducted from his paycheck each month, and he is behind on using them because of the holidays, so, its a win-win to use them up tonight. I have a small salad and half of a mini pizza, and there are leftovers for the next couple lunches I need to pack. 8 p.m. — As I unwind on the couch watching reruns and chat with my mom, she tells me that I should book a hotel for my Grandma's birthday trip to Vegas this summer. They have a block reserved and she wants to make sure I'm in the block. I book for the whole weekend, but they charge a one night deposit immediately.

"9:30 a.m. — I get moving pretty late this morning. It is Friday, my coworkers are at the retreat, and I'm working from home since I have an appointment this afternoon. It is Inauguration Day, so I will surely get more done from home with the TV on mute than I would have at work, constantly checking social media and news sites for updates. Boyfriend brewed coffee hours ago when he got up, so I microwave it and eat cereal with milk again for breakfast. 12:50 p.m. — I have a 1 p.m. appointment at Planned Parenthood. I'm on Medicaid (I qualified as a student, and my income hasn't gotten high enough to require reclassification), and PP is one of the few providers I can see for an IUD. I scheduled my appointment for today on purpose. Once I am taken back, we decide on Paragard and I also get my third Gardisil shot, which I'd been neglecting to do for years. The procedures are slightly painful, but I feel great that I checked these items off my to-do list. 2:30 p.m. — As I get back from the appointment, the pain sets in a bit. Watching the Inauguration and getting back to work doesn't really help! I quickly remember to make my donation to Planned Parenthood. I donate $35 for today, and set a recurring $5 donation for following months. I had considered doing this at the office, but the girl at the front desk was on a phone call and I didn't have cash. $35.00 4 p.m. — Still haven't had lunch. Boyfriend is home a bit early, and he is willing to make me what I'm craving — avocado toast with poached eggs. I supplement this ""lunch"" with some of the snacks from yesterday's cafeteria haul. 8:20 p.m. — Still on the couch. I'm feeling the cramps, and we've both had a long work week, so we decide to stay in tonight, crack open some wine, and make some grilled cheese as a late dinner (while watching more reruns). Daily Total: $35.00",2,144
"10 a.m. — French press coffee at home to start off a lazy Saturday. We had friends in town last weekend, so this weekend is about recharging (and mitigating the cramps I still have). I turn on coverage of the Women's March. I feel a bit of guilt for not going to the Denver March, but it has been a long week and I plan to contribute in other ways. As I check out social media, I'm proud to see so many friends participating. 12:30 p.m. — Friends stop by to borrow our skis and discuss plans for tonight. We catch up a bit while they're here, and decide on a late dinner. Knowing that we'll be eating late, I whip up a larger brunch — english muffins with avocado, fried eggs, and turkey bacon. The rest of the afternoon is spent working on the job search while binging on more on Hulu. I'd planned on getting things cleaned up around the house, but I still feel very accomplished for a Saturday. 5 p.m. — Can't make it to dinner time without a snack! has inspired boyfriend to add garlic powder and parmesan cheese to a bag of Smartfood popcorn... it is surprisingly good! 7:15 p.m. — Head downtown for dinner to meet the friends. We decided on a place that I have a Groupon for, and the other couple bought one too. Once we get there, we remember that most places only allow one Groupon per table. We ask the server to treat us as two separate tables, and she agrees! Our bill is almost entirely covered by the Groupon. We only owe $6.47 pre-tip. Since the other couple bought the wine, I pay their tip to even it out. $26.91 9:30 p.m. — We head to one more spot downtown for another glass of wine. We have a ""passport"" for buy one, get one drinks around town, so we pick a spot where we can utilize it. My boyfriend treats as a way to further even out the spending between the us and our friends, and to celebrate our friends' engagement. The walk home is uphill, and it has gotten colder, but we decide to count this as our exercise and forego taking a Lyft. Once home, we finish the night with a little more wine and this week's .

"10 a.m. — I am not a morning person. I'd scheduled a cycling class for 10, but I justify missing it. The gym is closing at the end of the month, and I have more classes than I know what to do with. Another morning of french press coffee, job applications, and TV. 12 p.m. — Breakfast/lunch at home is an english muffin with peanut butter and jelly, and a banana. 3 p.m. — Haircut at Ulta. I like to go here since I haven't found a standby hairdresser yet in Boulder, and I can earn points at Ulta. My hair is so dry and damaged (thanks, Colorado weather), so I decide to chop it! My mom had nothing nice to say about my hair when I was home for Christmas, so she offered to pay for the cut. It costs $57, and I charge it to a credit card that we share for occasions like this, and send her a selfie to say thanks. 4 p.m. — Meet up with boyfriend at the Target at the other end of the shopping center. Our cat needs food, and we've been wanting to make some other larger purchases with gift cards from Christmas. We stock up on a lot of cooking supplies. I am able to use a Cartwheel reward to get one piece of bakeware for free! Boyfriend pays the amount not covered by the gift cards, since I've covered the last few trips to Target. 5 p.m. — Back at Costco, again. We just got the membership for Christmas, so boyfriend needs to get his membership card, and we are in the neighborhood. We decide to open Costco Citi cards while at the membership desk to earn cash back on our Costco purchases. Another real reason we came here is to get a snack before cooking dinner. No sample carts are out, so I get us a hot dog and pop to share. Boyfriend buys himself a few things while I'm at the food counter. $1.62 6:30 — Real dinner time. A basic meal of chicken breasts and Brussels sprouts. I also throw together some cookies from a mix while the oven is hot. Boyfriend will bring some to his office tomorrow for a coworker's birthday, and it gives me a chance to use some of my new baking tools. Daily Total: $1.62",4,144
"8:15 a.m. — Keurig coffee and a quick breakfast (granola bar and banana) before heading out to work. It is a Monday. 12 p.m. — I eat the collection of random snacks I brought as a lunch (cup of soup from last week's cafeteria haul, veggie straws, carrots/hummus, Fiber One brownie) while working through lunch. I need to make up some hours that I missed last week. 5:15 p.m. — I head straight from work to a networking event south of the city. My gas light had gone on on my way to work, so I stop at a gas station on the way down. I pay for gas as needed instead of working it into my budget, since it can really vary depending on how many days I actually work in the office. Since Discover is currently giving 5% Cash Back for gas purchases, I make sure to use my Discover Card. $27.34 6 p.m. — I paid $25 to attend this networking event a few weeks back, so appetizers and a glass of wine are ""free!"" I quickly find my friends that are attending, we load up on apps, and order our wine. We all want to meet new people, but it is nice to chat amongst ourselves first. Throughout the night, we divide and conquer a bit, but I don't find anyone with my specific career interests. Still a good experience in meeting new people. 8:15 p.m. — As I'm driving back home, I see a cop shooting his radar gun at my car. I'm sure I am only going a few miles per hour over the limit, but I know my car stands out and that there is a speed trap on the highway. Rats! He signals for me to pull over, and I tell him that I was sure I was only going 5 m.p.h. over. After checking my ID and insurance, he lets me go with a warning. I did not want to have to pay a ticket. Luck works in my favor today. 9 p.m. — I'm a little startled when I get home, so I decompress and eventually realize I'm still hungry. I just snack on a few more appetizer-y foods (carrots and hummus again, snap pea crisps) and call it dinner. Daily Total: $27.34",5,144
"8:30 a.m. — Coffee and cereal at home before I get on the road, with an extra dose of coffee to-go. 11:30 a.m. — Snacks for lunch again today. I'm really trying to resist the urge to dine out, since I did so much of that over the holidays and in early January. Boyfriend brought my favorite soup home from his work cafeteria yesterday — carrot ginger. The microwave is super far from my office, so I keep putting off heating it up and get by on snacks. 4 p.m. — So hungry, but it feels too late to make my soup. Luckily, a meeting in the conference room left some chips behind, so I grab some to hold me over. 6:20 p.m. — I get home a bit late, still without having eaten a proper lunch. Boyfriend is working late tonight screening a movie. These events always have extra pizza,. I have a few snacks while I wait for him to get home, and pizza is served shortly after. 8:50 p.m. — As I'm cleaning out my inbox, I remember that my cousin emailed out an order form for her daughter's Girl Scout cookie sales. I was a Girl Scout through high school, and love this time of year. They will visit in a few months and bring the cookies with them. I order five boxes. For the rest of the night, I continue to get organized and watch some late night TV. $20.00 Daily Total: $20.00",6,144

We're out of half and half, so my coffee is black and ""bleh."" 11:45 a.m. — Already hungry for lunch — I finally heat up yesterday's soup, and it is delicious but not as filling as I'd like. I have a couple snacks to help hold me over. 4:15 p.m. — I left work a bit early, since my boss had left the office and I have yet another professional event tonight. I stop in the suburbs for a treat that cannot be found in Boulder: Chick-fil-a. I don't like to frequent this place, but I really have a taste for those little chicken nuggets. $8.49 4:40 p.m. — Next to Chick-fil-a is another place that does not exist in Boulder: Walmart! I really do not like to frequent Walmart either, but I have a $10 gift card that I got for signing up for E-bates a couple months back. I grab a couple things I need/want: half and half, Nivea in-shower lotion, and Elf liquid liner. This comes out to $11.70, but I have the gift card! $1.70 5:30 p.m. — This professional event is free for me, since I am still considered a ""recent grad."" It is a Q&A format with some appetizers and networking afterwards. 8 p.m. — I meet boyfriend for a quick dinner after the event. We are able to make it in to his work cafeteria for a last minute dinner, since I am in the neighborhood. We've taken advantage of this a lot lately since he didn't use many of his meals during the earlier part of the month. It is a great perk when we don't feel like cooking. Daily Total: $10.19",7,144

I chow down on a brie and pear sandwich on multigrain sourdough, my new favorite bread from Trader Joe's. $3 6:30 p.m. — It's pouring out, so I decide to make Cacio e Pepe for dinner, since it's some serious comfort food.

It pays about $10 an hour for 25 hours a week, so I’ll be earning what I used to make in a day over the course of a week. It is what it is — and the road to success is not linear, and other such bullshit words you find on Pinterest boards and clearance racks in Target. A friend from high school has a salaried job at my new gig and I meet her for lunch at a café prior to my “New Hire Orientation.” I get an iced green tea. $4 3:30 p.m. — Exhausted from the orientation, I head to Home Goods to sleep.

We share mac 'n' cheese, vanilla-bean French toast, a fried egg croissant sandwich, and a Mediterranean salad with roasted chicken. The French toast gets pretty neglected, much like me in the job market right now. The three of us split the cost. $30 (with tip) 4:45 p.m. — I walk my best friend over to Sephora, where she gets her makeup done. We have a great time with the makeup artist who somehow convinces me to try out false lashes and offers to glue them on for me. She tops it with a perfect winged liner.

I’m too hungover to deal with the subway, so I take a cab ($10). I had paid for eight sessions with a Groupon for about $170.

I figure chicken noodle soup is the way to go, so I buy chicken breasts, egg noodles, celery, carrots, an onion, parsley, thyme, ginger ale, a loaf of bread, hot sauce, and I make my own salad from the salad bar. It comes out to $48, but my boyfriend had given me his card. 9:15 p.m. — I finally head home and make myself a fruit smoothie with pineapple, berries, and mango.

Need all the sugar. 8:30 a.m. — I’m very proud of myself, because I remember to make a lunch. My office provides daily catering, but I opted out this month, because it costs around $100, which they take directly out of our paychecks. I make a tuna sandwich with avocado and pack an apple. I already had everything. 9 a.m. — I take the bus to work, which is already paid for by my monthly card, but it expires today, so I’ll have to renew it tomorrow. 2 p.m. — I’ve eaten my packed lunch, but I still feel hungry.

I bring a can of tuna, an avocado, and an apple for lunch. 9:30 a.m. — I get on the bus and remember my monthly card is expired. I have an app where I can pay through my phone, so I do that quickly and shamefully, because the bus driver hates waiting. $55, calculated in monthly expenses. 5:30 p.m. — My lunch was weird and I’m starving, so I pop into the 7-Eleven that is dangerously close to my bus stop and buy a hot dog. A ghost-chili hot dog with chili ketchup, to be exact. It should cost $3.70, but I use my ""frequent hotdog eater card."" It’s my seventh one, so it’s free. I wish I was joking. 7 p.m. — I do a 30-minute workout in my living room to a YouTube video, because I can’t be bothered to walk five minutes to the gym. 9 p.m. — My boyfriend gets home and we smoke a couple bowls. Weed is about $15 per gram here and a gram lasts us about a month. This particular bag, however, we found in the basket of a bicycle outside of our apartment. So...$0. 10 p.m. — We eat too many helpings of spaghetti and tomato sauce from the cupboard for dinner. Daily Total: $0",2,147
"7 a.m. — I roll out of bed and walk five minutes to the gym. I’ve already prepaid for the month, but every time I go in, I end up splurging in the vending machines. This morning, I get a ginseng energy iced tea. $2.97 9 a.m. — I take the bus to work and realize I forgot lunch. I stop at 7-Eleven on my way into the office and buy a tuna sandwich. I should have gotten more creative, since that’s what I would have made for myself anyway, but I always stress out about food selections and end up going with the familiar. $5.20 5 p.m. — I ditch work a little early and go shopping. I need some nude heels and I find the perfect pair at Aldo. $59 6:30 p.m. – Take the bus home. 8 p.m. — Boyfriend makes green pesto pasta with salmon and lemon for dinner, his favorite dish and his treat!

A really sweaty young guy sits next to me and I’m annoyed, because there are plenty of empty seats on the bus. 7 p.m. — My boyfriend gets home with groceries. I asked him to get stuff to make breakfast burritos for dinner, because I have a bunch of avocados that are going to go bad soon. He buys tortillas, cilantro, salsa, eggs, and three different kinds of frozen, fried snack food for our munchies later (mozzarella sticks, chicken nuggets, jalapeño poppers). Total is $36.20 and I offer to split it, but he says no because I paid for that overpriced ramen earlier in the week. Daily Total: $10.42",4,147
"8:30 a.m. — It’s Friday, so I woke up way too late for work to go to the gym. I don’t want to go to work at all, because I won tickets for a big festival that’s been going on all week and I wanted to go up on Friday, since it was ending Sunday. 9:30 a.m. — I grab an apple on my way to work. I’m so late. 11:30 a.m. — The catered lunch is in the office, which I opted out of this month to save that money, but there is SO MUCH extra food. I cave and just eat the work’s lunch — I am the worst! Nobody notices or cares. This could be dangerous! 3:30 p.m. — I boldly go back for seconds, because I just got told I’ll have to stay late for a meeting. 4 p.m. — My boyfriend shows up at work with roses and tells me that I actually don’t have a meeting, he had my coworkers lie to me, because he wanted to surprise me and take me out and he knew I’d leave. 5 p.m. — MY BOYFRIEND PROPOSES TO ME IN A PARK. There were picnic blankets, rose petals, Champagne, and cheese. I’m over the moon! 8 p.m. — We go for dim sum and cocktails for dinner. We are running late for the reservation he made, so we take an Uber. I pay. $17.92 8:15 p.m. — I order a cocktail and wonton soup, my boyfriend orders a beer and wonton soup, and we share pork dumplings and duck spring rolls. The bill comes out to $68.10 (you don’t tip in Denmark) and we would have split it, but he won $75 betting on Iceland in the Euro Cup, so he treats. 10 p.m. — Our friends are waiting for us at a nearby beer-and-barbecue restaurant to celebrate. We pop bottles of fancy beer to celebrate our engagement. I don’t really like beer, so I get a gin and tonic. $12  11 p.m. — We head to a dance club and shake it to some funky house all night. Someone buys both my fiancé and I gin and tonics to say congrats. We accept! 2 a.m. — We take an Uber home. I pay again. $23.89 Daily Total: $53.81",5,147
"11 a.m. — We slept in late, because it’s Saturday and we’re hungover and engaged! We’re going to the festival today, which is the last day. We’ll see New Order and LCD Soundsystem! Yas.

The blow is a steal at $75 for a gram and the Molly is pretty standard price at $60 for a gram. We’ll share with people later, so we don’t mind fronting. My half is  $65.70, but my friends pay me $45 back, so $20.70 . 4:30 p.m. — We share an Uber to the festival with two other girls and split the flat fare, which is a special specifically for the festival. My part is $18.65 . 5 p.m. — Festival time! One of the girls we rode up with has an artist pass, so she gets everyone a round of free whiskey sours. 6 p.m. — I buy a mint gin and tonic, this will be the second and last drink I have tonight. Once I start taking anything else, I usually just drink water. $12 7 p.m. — We see New Order and it is amazing!! 9 p.m. to 2 a.m. — This time is just a big blur basically of dancing and music, laughing, smoking, and fun. We see Mø, Shades, Immortal Technique, and LCD Soundsystem. 2 a.m. — My best friend and I are the first ones that want to leave. We split an Uber back and let the boys stay and party on. $37.33 2:30 a.m. — I shouldn’t be hungry, but am desperately craving salty water, so I boil rice in a little too much chicken broth then squirt Sriracha on it and throw in a few basil leaves. I text my friend a photo of my “rice soup” and we both think it looks very legit. Daily Total: $92.38",6,147
"11 a.m. — We are Jell-O-based garbage humans. Fiancé got home around 6 a.m., so we will not be doing anything productive today. 7 p.m. — Literally nothing to report before this. At 7, we finally manage to get dressed and go for a walk. We find a little Thai restaurant and decide to sit there and have dinner. I have a large tom yum soup and he has a duck dish with rice. We split the bill, my total is $14.90 Daily Total: $14.90",7,147
"8:45 a.m. — Feeling tired and hungover from a holiday weekend, I indulge in a greasy bacon, egg, and cheese sandwich and small iced coffee on my way to the office. $7.90 1 p.m. — Normally I try to pack a lunch for work, but because I’m in between apartments right now with most of my dishes still packed away, I get an over-priced salad near my office. $10.55 4 p.m. — I recently broke up with my boyfriend and moved out of our apartment in Astoria into a new place with friends in Bed-Stuy. Today I filled out a change of address form online so I don’t have to keep stopping by my old place to get my mail. $1 8 p.m. — After work, I head to the apartment of a new guy I’ve been hanging out with, and he orders pizza for us.

"8:45 a.m. — Our office orders bagels for everyone on Wednesdays, so I grab one on my way to my desk. 10 a.m. — Already struggling to stay awake at my desk, I decide a coffee is a must and run up to our building’s cafeteria. $1.30 1 p.m. — I neglected to pack myself a lunch again, so I visit the cafeteria again and get a salad and side of green beans. The food in our cafeteria is pretty bland, but it’s cheaper than what I’d get at a restaurant nearby. $7.50 6 p.m. — After work, I run to Walgreens to get a hair dryer to leave at my new guy’s apartment for when I spend the night, and also some laundry detergent because I’ve run out of clean clothes. $40.25 6:15 p.m. — I take a cab from my guy’s place to my apartment in Brooklyn, because I had several bags of clothes and miscellaneous stuff with me that I deemed too heavy to carry on the subway. I hate taking cabs when I’m not too drunk for the subway, but I decide I can make an exception this time. $27.53 7:15 p.m. — Finally, I’m doing laundry after about a month-and-a-half of living out of a book bag after breaking up with my boyfriend and couch-surfing my way through the city. $10 7:30 p.m. — I get some groceries so I can start packing my lunch again and hopefully save some money. I hate cooking, so I keep it simple with items like hummus, carrots, cheese, and crackers. $19.95 7:45 p.m. — The first official night in my new apartment with my roommates calls for some celebratory wine, so I pick up a cheap bottle of rosé at the liquor store down the block. $10 8:30 p.m. — Too tired and hot to cook dinner (we have no AC and only one fan in our apartment), my roommates and I order Mexican food, which one roommate buys and I later Venmo her for. $15 Daily Total: $131.53",2,148

They provide breakfast, so I grab some yogurt, fruit, and pressed juice. 1 p.m. — For lunch, I have some hummus and carrots that I brought from home. 2 p.m. — I didn’t sleep much last night, because it was insanely hot in my bedroom, so I get a coffee to keep me from passing out at my desk. $3 6:30 p.m. — I’m unpacking with one of my roommates at my new place tonight, so I grab two bottles of wine to help us complete our boring task. $20 8:30 p.m. — Thankfully, the burrito I ordered last night was huge, so I have leftovers for dinner.

I get a bagel and a small iced coffee — my usual. $6.60 11 p.m. — I’m hanging out at my new guy’s apartment, and all the restaurants near his apartment are starting to close, so we make some popcorn for dinner and mix up some drinks to sip on before we head out for the night. 2 a.m. — We finally make it out to the bar and enjoy a few rounds. My man picks up the tab. Daily Total: $6.60",4,148

We both get an entrée and two drinks, and we split the bill. $30.53 4:30 p.m. — We decide to day drink and head to the Standard. I order us a round and am reminded of how expensive this place can be. $35 5:30 p.m. — Next, we stop by the Brass Monkey for a few more drinks. My roommate starts a tab, and I Venmo her for my half. Later, the new guy I’m seeing shows up and buys the remainder of our drinks. $18.50 1 a.m. — After drinking all day and letting my new guy pay, I ask him to let me pick up the last tab and he agrees. $60.97 1:30 a.m. — We hop in a cab back to my guy’s apartment, and he pays.

But this weekend, the guy I recently started dating is taking me on a trip for my birthday, and I want to get a few new outfits so I look good. I head to Soho and do some damage, buying several tank tops, a romper, two bralettes and a pair of overalls. I tell myself it’s okay to spend some money because it’s almost my birthday, and I really, really like this new guy. $206.55 9 p.m. — After my shopping spree, I decide there’s no way I can justify ordering takeout, and I have some crackers and cheese at home. Daily Total: $207.85",7,148
"8 a.m. — Today is payday! 9 a.m. — It feels like I've been at work for hours, but it's only been 30 minutes. I go to the mini fridge for water and see LaCroix; I thank my frenemy who ordered them. 10:15 a.m. — I forgot to bring food to work because I was running late. I reluctantly go downstairs and get a small quiche. Since I will have no time to go home for lunch, I buy lunch, too (salmon and Brussels sprouts with mushroom bisque). I'm disappointed in myself. I pay up. $24.71 11:30 a.m. — It's very quiet around the office, so I decide to handle some personal matters. I renew my car tabs, which expire tomorrow, and leave the car registered at my mom's address in the 'burbs because it's $80 cheaper ($89.75). I renew my driver’s license ($54) and my Costco card ($55). $198.75  12 p.m. — I'm on a roll and still no action in the office, so I just go ahead and pay 50% of all of my bills due on the first early, and pay the final 50% of all my bills due on the 20th. I split everything over both paychecks so I'm not burdened by a large payment coming out at once. Rent/utilities ($640), car payment (second-to-last one, $131), cable/internet ($76.20), cell phone ($71.24), car/renters' insurance ($84.30), medical bills ($157.78), credit card/debt ($237.70). Counted in my monthly expenses. 12:30 p.m. — I eat my lunch that I bought earlier. 2 p.m. — My favorite coworker tells me she's given her two weeks’ notice, and happy hour tomorrow is going to be her last. I was going to skip it to save money; usually, when I’m not knocking back a gin fizz, you’d find me eating, dancing, tipping go-go boys and drag queens, and slaying trivia, but this week is different. I was blowing my budget monthly on going out (>$400 per month), so I decided to try a ""No-Dine Month."" But now, I have to go to my friend's final work happy hour. I don't know what I'm going to do without her! 4 p.m. — I'm finally off work, and I need to go to the grocery store. I have to give a girl from Freecycle some stuff at 5 p.m., so it gives me a perfect opportunity to take inventory of what I have before shopping. I use an app called Pepperplate to catalog my recipes and then generate them into a shopping list. It's overkill, but I love it. It shouldn't come as any surprise that I'm one of those neurotic people who goes to three different grocery stores to get the best deal. 6 p.m. — By the time I get home, do the Freecycle exchange, and change out of my work clothes, I feel totally beat and lose all motivation to go to the store. I have a free trial of AmazonFresh left (I used it for years before they started charging $299 — actually, WTF Amazon?), so I decide to order from there for delivery tomorrow morning before work. I end up getting lettuce, tarragon, sage, cilantro, parsley, coconut water, tomatoes, avocado, cheddar cheese, portobello mushrooms, cayenne, jalapeño, spinach, ginger, eggs, and zucchini. $47.91  7:30 p.m. — I start to feel like I might actually be getting sick, so I go lie down. 9 p.m. — I wake up, and my mind starts racing. I drop my phone off my bed, and my phone case finally gives up. I go on the Amazon app and buy a new phone case. $24.10  10 p.m. — I laze around watching TV and drinking water, trying to feel better. I switch between and ( Just kidding). This guy thinks he's dating Katy Perry, and I start to ponder how I would execute moving out of the country if I did something so embarrassing on national television. I suddenly get a late-night craving for pasta. I usually don't eat after 6 p.m., but I have ""emergency orecchiette"" for moments like this. 1 a.m. — I go to the bathroom and see I'm out of room spray. I'm very specific about this Mrs. Meyers Lavender air freshener, so I go to Amazon for the third time in eight hours and order that, too. It is somehow 1 a.m. now, and I try to go back to sleep. $13.81  Daily Total: $309.28",1,149
"7 a.m. — I wake up with a stuffed-up nose and swollen eyes, and I hit snooze repeatedly. 7:20 a.m. — Probably the fourth snooze, and I realize I have six missed calls from the front door. Oops. Luckily, AmazonFresh calls back, and I open the door for them. I put everything away quickly. I have to run errands on my lunch break, and I'll come home to eat; I pack an apple and hard-boiled eggs for breakfast. 9 a.m. — I read this article about donating white blood cells at Fred Hutch. They give you up to $800, but I am more interested in helping cancer research. I fill out the donor forms and email them to the program director. 10:45 a.m. — No one is in the office. I've been reading Refinery29 for the past hour. I eat a nectarine from the office fruit bowl. 12:30 p.m. — I'm starved and need to get away from staring blankly into the computer void at my desk. I'm starting to volunteer at an assisted living community next door to my apartment, so I need to get a few shots. I stop by the nurse’s station at the ALC to get my first of two required TB shots, and it's a complete shitshow. I leave with blood running down my arm and rush home to get a Band-Aid and to have lunch (Mediterranean tuna salad with canned tuna, olives, capers, sun-dried tomatoes I always have around, and spinach from AmazonFresh). I stand outside on the balcony for a few minutes and breathe deeply — the weather is amazing and the air smells so fresh today! 1:30 p.m. — On my way back to work, I decide I want a brownie. I go to Starbucks, and the line for the drive-thru is outrageous, so I do the unthinkable: I go inside. I get a brownie and put it on a gift card from my boss. After I get my brownie, I notice a S’mores Bar in the case, and can't believe I wasted time on a brownie like an amateur when there was a molten marshmallow gift waiting to be purchased. 4 p.m. — I leave work. I am launching a comedy podcast with my best friend, and we usually record on Thursdays, which tampers any guilt I have for not staying at work until 5 p.m. My friend has to skip this week, but I leave anyway so I can do some chores before Happy Hour. 5 p.m. — I decide to take a shot of vodka so that I will drink less/spend less tonight. Rookie move. One, it tastes horrible. Two, I'm not 18 anymore. 5:20 p.m. to 9 p.m. — I'm late to Happy Hour as usual, but I get a Mai-Tai and a margarita and almost cry because work is going to suck even more without my friend. An hour of complaining about work turns into four hours. I cash out. $18 10 p.m. — I talk to one of my colleagues outside who's totally bumming me out. A homeless man berating us gives me an excuse to bail, so I head home. I decide I can't live without pizza, and after two days of arbitrarily craving carbs, I read up on ""Carb Cravings"" over a pepperoni slice. $8.95 11 p.m. — Bedtime. Daily Total: $26.95",2,149
"7:45 a.m. — I wake up late and remember I hate drinking. I'm not even hungover; I just feel like a garbage person — dehydrated, filled with late-night pizza, and opening my eyes 45 minutes before I have to be at my desk. 8:15 a.m. — I go to Starbucks and get Nitro Cold Brew. This is where we're at in Seattle; the craft beer culture and the coffee culture are so ubiquitous that it's coalesced into Starbucks putting cold brew on Nitro taps. Also, I finally get my S’mores bar, and it totally sucks. I feel vindicated about going with a tried-and-true brownie yesterday. Cost is $7.43, but I put it on the gift card. 1:20 p.m. — It's already past 1 p.m. and I haven't eaten lunch today…not sure I even feel hungry after the S’mores bar. 5 p.m. — After eating erratically like a college freshman for the past two days, I decide to assert some grown-ass-woman control over my life. I take out the compost, trash, and recycling; I start roasting broccoli and simmering barbacoa I had in the freezer. I clean the kitchen and bathroom, put together a box of Goodwill stuff, and stack all the paperwork I need to go through. 5:45 p.m. — I do some elliptical and strength training and find quarters for the laundry. I'm lucky my laundry is cheap. I eat barbacoa lettuce wraps. $1 6:30 p.m. — I take a shower and go to switch the laundry over to dry. Then I go back to my apartment and slather a hydrating mask on my face. $1 7:30 p.m. — I diffuse-dry my hair and put it up in a pineapple. I steam some wrinkly clothes with my garment steamer (the best thing I've ever bought). 8 p.m. — My freelance client texts that he wants me to come by in the afternoon tomorrow, so I plan a brunch with my friend in the morning. I say I'll bring champagne. 11 p.m. — I keep cleaning late into the night. I look like one of those ""cleaning as a metaphor for moving on after a breakup"" movie montages, when the protagonist is all ""out with the old, in with the new,"" and then she stands back to look at her work, and you're watching saying, ""Good work, Margaret! You go, girl!"" Only I'm not wearing overalls, and Don Henley’s ""Heart of the Matter"" isn't playing in the background. Okay, maybe it is. On low volume. 12 a.m. — Bedtime. Daily Total: $2",3,149
"9 a.m. — I wake up totally frazzled because I meant to get up early to work out. I am supposed to be at my friend's place by 10 a.m. and I have to get myself together for my freelance meeting and brunch. 10:20 a.m. — Running late, and as I park, I realize I forgot champagne. I go up to my friend’s apartment and apologize that I'm a mess, and he says he needs some groceries for brunch anyway. I pay for parking on my phone. $3.60 10:40 a.m. — We walk down to Whole Foods to get champagne, orange juice, yogurt, and berries. Watermelons are on sale, so we get one and two La Croix (coconut for him, apricot for me). He picks up a few fashion magazines. I pay ($39.59) and he pays me back $20 in cash. $19.59 11 a.m. — We eat bacon, eggs, and English muffins he already had, plus yogurt and berry parfaits, and drink mimosas while watching . I'm wondering how this movie was made in 1999 but looks like it's from 1984. Either way, I'm living for it. 1:15 p.m. — I tell my friend I have to cut our kiki short for work. He has to get going, too, for a wedding. He sends me home with a container full of watermelon, and I head over to my client's house. 2 p.m. — My client has just gotten back from traveling and is going off the deep end. He cuts our time short, but still pays me for three hours. +$75 4 p.m. — I contemplate going out, but it's 100 degrees outside, and I have air conditioning. I go home and eat barbacoa lettuce wraps again and continue getting rid of my old stuff. 5 p.m. — It seems like no one is in my building, which is amazing because I have the whole laundry room to myself. I unapologetically use three of the washers at once. $3 7 p.m. — Switch over to dryers. $3 9 p.m. — My mom texts me. We make plans to hang out tomorrow before she goes out of town for two weeks. 10 p.m. — I debate whether to have a cocktail or not. I decide no and edit the last podcast. 11 p.m. — Bedtime.

We agree to meet at 1 p.m. She wants to get her nails done, and after my failed attempt the other night, I decide to bite the bullet and let a professional do this. 12 p.m. — I run over to the assisted living facility next door to get my TB test read. I had a horrible allergic reaction to the shot, and the area looks awful, but they assure me that I'm tuberculosis-free. 1 p.m. — I meet my mom at the nail salon, and I get a manicure with her. The manicurist does a horrible job. I should confront her and refuse to pay, but I don't want to sit there any longer to get a redo. $46 3 p.m. —We go to lunch, and I eat an enchilada. My mom feels really bad that my nails were done so poorly at her go-to place, so she pays. 5 p.m. — We go to my mom's house (my childhood home) and girl-talk for an hour. She sends me home with two microbrews her employee gave her (she hates beer). 6 p.m. — I arrive home and text the Mr. to tell his cousin happy birthday, because I assume my husband forgot.

"7:30 a.m. — On my way to work, a man from the suite upstairs joins me in the elevator. After several moments of silence, he turns to point at me and says, ""I hope YOU have an awesome day today."" I say, ""You too."" He laments that ""people don't talk to each other enough."" I respond, ""I don't know if that's true — it's early in the morning,"" and get off at my floor. He yells ""have a good one!"" behind me. I try really hard not to be a participant of the Seattle Freeze, and I get that it's a real thing, but honestly, isn't 7:30 a.m. too early to talk in any city?

I look for my favorite Essie nude shade (Perennial Chic). They don't have it. $26.98 8 p.m. — I hate all of this lipstick and confirm that I can't pull off cool-toned brown.

I eat an apple and avocado from the office fruit bowl. 12 p.m. — I've had four cups of coffee, and I'm buzzing and sweating. I don't do well with caffeine after a certain point. I realize I've passed that point. 2 p.m. — I've been jogging all day, back and forth around the office. My frenemy is casually relaxing and reading instead of bothering to ask if I might need a hand. She's truly one of the worst coworkers I've ever had, but her lack of awareness is so laughable that I can never get mad enough to hate her. 3 p.m. — At the 11th hour, someone tells me that we don't even have beverages for a company event tomorrow. I run out of the office like a madwoman to get to the store. 5 p.m. — I run into Trader Joe's and beeline to get ice cream for our recipe, plus alcohol and some other essentials that I've run out of at home. $70.31 6 p.m. — I eat some weird meal bar and a pepperoni stick I picked up at TJ’s in the car on my way back to my house. I arrive in the nick of time and put everything away before my partner arrives. 7 p.m. — I'm panting and having an adrenaline- and caffeine-induced existential crisis while my partner begins to quietly do the mise en place so I can breathe. I realize I don't have any ice, so we have non-ideal-temperature Palomas to take the edge off. 8 p.m. — We make a double batch of Mexican Chocolate cookies so I can take some for my company event tomorrow. 9 p.m. — We record, drink cocktails, and eat so many cookies. They are delicious. We finish recording, and I download the files for editing. I walk her to her car a couple of blocks away. On my walk back to my apartment, the air smells really fresh, and some sprinklers from a yard are hitting the sidewalk. It’s still warm from the heat wave today, and I can finally relax. I stand right in front of the sprinkler for a few minutes, and then run down the hill to my apartment. 11 p.m. — I clean up our baking mess, package up the cookies for work tomorrow, and go to bed.

"1 p.m. — Woke up around 11 a.m., but I wasn't feeling hungry. I'm still not that hungry, so I grab a plum and kiwi to snack on, as well as a couple of Tate's cookies my mom let behind. 4 p.m. — I decide to order a few things on Amazon: Woolite, travel detergent packets, six packing cubes (mix of regular, compression in different sizes), and bra wash bags to protect my bras in the washer so I don't have to hand-wash. I'm going on vacation to Europe next week and firmly believe in traveling with carry-on bags only, so the compression bags and travel detergent packets will come in handy! Bra wash bags and Woolite also extend the life of your bras and other delicates, saving money in the long-run. Prime will have these delivered in a couple days. $109.42 8 p.m. — Try a vegetarian restaurant on Seamless while catching up on television. I order two appetizers, one small plate, and one entree. I have enough for leftovers later this week. $41.02  Daily Total: $150.44",1,150
"8:30 a.m. — Start answering emails and skip breakfast. Eating breakfast when I'm not hungry makes me feel nauseous, so I usually skip it. Instead, I grab my French press out of the fridge, where I have been cold-brewing tea and pour it into a travel bottle to take to work. I have been cold-brewing tea all summer and it is amazing. It's refreshing, caffeinated, and keeps me from buying iced coffees every day. 10 a.m. — Head to work on the subway using my monthly Metrocard, paid for by work. 3 p.m. — Chipotle salad for lunch. $9  5 p.m. — Work has been crazy, so I am finally getting around to purchasing my friend's wedding gift three weeks after the wedding. $74.16 on Etsy and a $50 Amazon gift card. Total: $124.16 7:15 p.m. — Take the subway to the pharmacy to pick up my prescription. Comes to $3.91, but I pay for it with my health FSA debit card. 7:30 p.m. — Meet a couple of friends for drinks while waiting for our table at Burger and Lobster. Haven't seen these guys in a few months, so a get-together was long overdue. Once seated, we each order a lobster roll, but one of the guys really wants to try the burger, as well, so we order a burger to share along with a few rounds of drinks. We split the bill. $91.94 , including tip. 10:30 p.m. — One more round and dessert at a nearby bar. We split the bill. $14.34 (tip included) 11 p.m. — Inspired by mom's leftover cookies from the weekend, I swing by the neighborhood bodega to grab cash from the ATM and pick up some Tate's cookies, because I'm drunk and making bad decisions. Make some more bad decisions and send a text for delivery of some illicit substances, but he misses my text, which is probably a good thing, actually. Keeps me from spending $100 unnecessarily! Drunk decisions: $6.31  Daily total: $245.75",2,150
"6 a.m. — Wake up and check my email for any urgent issues from the European or Asian teams. Nothing pressing, so I sleep in until 8:30 a.m. Then, I start doing a little work from home. Grab some French press cold brew pu-erh black tea from the fridge to wake up. 11 a.m. — Take the subway to work. This might seem late, but I've been working from home for the past few hours. While my company has a big office here in NYC, the vast majority of my department is on the West Coast with additional smaller teams in Asia and Europe. My boss is incredibly flexible, so I can work from offices in other cities or from home when I need to. 2 p.m. — I'm starving. The problem with working on a West Coast schedule is that weekly meetings scheduled for morning Pacific time tend to correspond with lunchtime in New York. Usually, it's fine, and eating at 11:30 a.m. or after 2 p.m. also allows me to avoid the massive lines at prime lunchtime. I debate fresh&co vs. Xian Famous Foods and give in to unhealthy Chinese food, since I know I have a healthy veggie dinner tonight. I get spicy cumin lamb noodles and cucumber salad. $16.88 3:30 p.m. — Feeling a bit lethargic, so I grab some more tea that I had brewed overnight from the office fridge. I usually have 2-to-3 quarts cold-brewing between work and home, since it'll keep for a few days and you never know when you need a little more caffeine. This time, it's a lavender Earl Grey blend, which smells divine. I really love how tea smells, but I don't love the astringent/bitter tannins in hot tea. Cold tea is naturally milder and sweeter. 5 p.m. — I've been looking for some cheap e-books to read on the beach. There are versions of classics that you can pick up for free or for very cheap if you are looking for a particular translation. I bought in French for free and in English for less than $1 on Amazon! $0.99 7:45 p.m. — I leave the office after my last call and take the subway to the cheap massage place near my apartment. I get massages about twice a month and have found a couple of great cheap Chinese massage places in West Village and Flatiron that offer one-hour massages for $39. This time, I try someone other than my regular guy, which was a bad call. Most of the massage is fine until he tries to do some sort of spinal twisting which left me with a sharp pain in my lower back. Normally, I would tip an extra $21 to bring it to an even $60, but this pain can't go ignored. The rest of the massage was fine until the twisting, so overall, I pay $50 . 9:15 p.m. — I go home and have my leftovers from a couple of days ago while watching on Prime Video.

"5:45 a.m. — Wake up for a 6 a.m. call with a couple of my German teammates and an external partner in Germany. This call is optional for me due to the timing, but I am curious to hear firsthand how it goes. Have some tea that I have in the fridge to wake up. I already warned my coworkers that I will be groggy and probably just listen to the call on mute. 10:30 a.m. — Take the subway to the office after doing some work at home. 11:30 a.m. — Head to fresh&co early to pick up a vegan Gaucho salad, which is my favorite. I can't resist picking up a bag of sea salt and vinegar Popchips. $11.38 7:30 p.m. — One of my meetings got cancelled, so I hop on the subway and take my last call from home. I was supposed to have drinks with a client, but he reschedules, so I have the evening free! I have some produce from the farmers' market, so I peel and cut a bunch of kiwis, mangos, and peaches. I also remember I have super-fresh corn from the market, as well, so I make myself a raw sweet corn, kiwi, and peach salad. Yum! The other two ears of corn I'll oven-roast over the weekend. 8:30 p.m. — The salad was delicious but really light, so I order mie goreng with tofu from Rasa on Seamless. I can't finish it so my roommate polishes it off. $14.09 Daily Total: $25.47",4,150
"8:30 a.m. — Grab tea from fridge and hop on a call with our German team to discuss issues with one of our external partners before getting ready and heading to the office via subway. 9:15 a.m. — Feeling hungry for once, so I get an egg white veggie omelet with cheese and indulge in an iced coffee. $9 12:30 p.m. — After eating breakfast, I'm not super-hungry, but I have lunch scheduled with a friend/former coworker. She's now working for a competitor and I took over a lot of her responsibilities after she left. We go to a sushi place. I just get Diet Coke, a few pieces of sashimi, and miso soup. We argue over who will cover the bill (both companies would reimburse) and I finally manage to convince her that I should pay to congratulate her on the new role and as a thank you for giving me advice. $48.29 (work will reimburse me) 1:45 p.m. — I have about an hour until my next call and I want to buy a couple of casual dresses for vacation, so I pop into H&M on the way back to the office. No luck. I swing by BCBG. There is a pair of cute shorts, but I'll sleep on it. I do buy a necklace that's on sale plus another 40% off. On top of that, I spot a little damage, so get another 10% taken off! $25.40 2 p.m. — I buy a Diet Coke from the vending machine after my walk back. It’s SO hot out. $1.10 4 p.m. — Since I couldn't find anything on H&M, I check out Amazon and find a cute black off-the-shoulder dress and get one-day delivery for tomorrow. $50.98 6 p.m. — Impromptu drinks with some friends/external partners after our meeting with them ends at 5:30 p.m. We order food and drinks. I pay, since I plan on submitting an expense report next week, anyway. $276.18 (work will reimburse me) 9 p.m. — I take an Uber home. $11.45 (work will reimburse me) 10 p.m. — We are running low on sodas and water, so I order some to be delivered from Costco on Google Express. $24.60 Daily Total: $111.08 ($447 total, $335.92 reimbursed by work)",5,150
"8:30 a.m. — Friday at last! I wake up and decide to work from home today, so I can pack. I found out earlier this week that I need to go to London last-minute for work, leaving tomorrow. Luckily, I'm scheduled to be in Europe for vacation starting next Wednesday, so I will just go straight from my work trip to vacation. I wake myself up with black tea from the fridge. 9:30 a.m. — Nothing urgent this morning. My calls don't start until 11:20, so I head to my nail salon to get a pedicure and gel manicure for my upcoming vacation. $67.31 ,  including tip. 1:30 p.m. — I order food on Seamless. $18.99 9 p.m. — A couple of friends from business school are visiting from L.A.! A bunch of us go to dinner at Asellina for a belated engagement celebration dinner for them. We split the bill. I don't typically go out to dinner these days unless it's for work, but the two this week were for special occasions! $8.84 for the cab, $98.47 for dinner. 11:30 p.m. — Next stop, karaoke. I had made these plans before I knew about my last-minute work travel, but I've already rescheduled three times on a couple of these friends and am determined not to do it again, especially since I'll be gone for over two weeks. $68 for karaoke and drinks. 3 a.m. — I finally head home after a couple games of beer pong at a friend's apartment. Luckily I was able to pack during the day, since I worked from home. I order an Uber home and sleep for three hours. $12.56 Daily Total: $274.17",6,150
"6:30 a.m. — I finish up the tea I have left in the fridge and get myself an Uber to the airport. I usually travel one-to-two weeks per month and work pays for most of my expenses during those trips. $57.19 (work will reimburse me) 7:30 a.m. — Arrive at airport. Debate paying for a last-minute upgrade and decide it isn't worth it for a daytime flight. I usually upgrade myself with miles for red-eye flights, so I can sleep in the lie-flat seats in business. I clear security in about 10 minutes (thank you, Global Entry/TSA Pre-Check). Feeling a bit peckish, so I get a veggie sandwich and a Diet Coke. I eat half the sandwich. $17.23 (work will reimburse me) 8 a.m. — Grab water and snacks right before I board. $8.89 (work will reimburse me) 10 a.m. — After finishing boarding a little over an hour ago and taxiing on the runway for a while, we finally take off. I purchase Wi-Fi as soon as it is available. $19.99 (work will reimburse me) 11 a.m. — I suddenly realize I still have the two ears of corn in the fridge. Sigh. This is why I rarely buy groceries these days. I used to cook all the time, but my travel schedule is super-unpredictable these days. I email my roommate to tell her to feel free to have the corn and provide instructions on how to cook it (she can barely boil water). Lunch cart goes down the aisle. It isn't great, so I only have a couple of bites and give my ice cream to the kid sitting in front of me...maybe I should have upgraded. 2:30 p.m. — Airline provides a snack. I have that along with the remaining half of the sandwich I bought earlier. 8:30 p.m. (London time) — We land around 3:30 p.m. EDT, but London is five hours ahead. I clear customs/passport control pretty quickly via the E.U./U.K. lines. I applied for and enrolled in the U.K. Registered Traveller program due to my frequent work travel to London, so I don't have to wait in the much longer line for non-citizens of E.U./U.K. I take the Heathrow Express into Central London, buying a ticket on the app as I walk from the airport terminal. $32.15 (work will reimburse me) 9:30 p.m. — I arrive at Paddington Station and hop in an Uber to my hotel. $16.31 (work will reimburse me) 9:45 p.m. — I check in at my hotel, drop my stuff off, change clothes, and freshen up my makeup. I have to pay upfront for the entire four-day stay. $1,255.30 (work will reimburse me) 10:30 p.m. — The sandwich and snack isn't holding me over. I'm starving. I get an Uber and head out to meet some friends who live in London for a late dinner and drinks. $10.92 for Uber and $97.42 for dinner and drinks (work will reimburse me) 2 a.m. — I drag myself back to the hotel in an Uber and will myself to fall asleep so I acclimate to the new time zone.

"6:30 a.m. — I work from home, but I get up early so I can take an hour out in the afternoon to run errands. 7 a.m. — I was in Taipei a few weeks ago and refreshed my stash of health food, so I add chia and flax seeds to a bowl of Greek yogurt with oats and a banana. I have two cups of green tea and, for good measure, drink a glass of water with a calcium effervescent tab. I have breakfast while reading the news. 8 a.m. — I ride my bike 15 minutes to the gym and practice reading Chinese characters while power-walking on the treadmill. 9:45 a.m. — Slather some almond butter on toast and get to work on an article on social enterprises in China. 12 p.m. — I need a break, and I need groceries. I grab a backpack and bike 15 minutes to a former open-air fruit stand that's now an expat grocery haven. It's run by a woman lovingly referred to as The Avocado Lady who stocks her stall with her namesake fruit and everything else Western expats desperately crave. I leave with avocados, fresh peas, a dozen eggs, an eggplant, zucchini, bell peppers, kale, green beans, a bag of dried chickpeas, and a bag of lentils. I also get 1 kg (35 ounces) of Greek yogurt  at a shocking almost $10 — I really need to make my own. The produce and dairy will last me 10 days, and the beans a month or so. $40 1 p.m. — My lovely retiree neighbors are chit-chatting in the hallway, as they do daily. And, as they do every time I come home with groceries, they ask what's in the bag and then laugh at ""the strange things foreigners eat."" I love chatting with them, and it's great Chinese practice. When my sweet and saintly next-door neighbor's son got married, I baked them some chocolate chip cookies, and now the neighbors regularly ask me if I'm baking them. I wish. Instead, I make a kale salad and then procrastinate writing by washing some sweaters. 3:15 p.m. — I finish the article and send it to an editor in Bangkok. 4 p.m. — My housekeeper arrives, and we chat a bit. I offer her some toast, which she's never had before. I tell her it's better with almond butter, and she agrees.

An iced soy latte is $5 + $1 tip. $6 5:30 p.m. — I go to Trader Joe’s every Sunday to do my food shopping for the week. I find that it is cheaper than the local grocery, so the distance is worth it (a 45-minute bus ride). Today, I have a $50 Amex gift card from a focus group I participated in last week, so technically, the groceries are free.

I use up the last of my Amex gift card to pay for the drink. 6:30 p.m. — Kiddo and I get pizza for dinner, her favorite. I have a slice with just tomato. Her mom pays. 11:30 p.m. — Mom gets back, pays me $80, and puts me in an Uber home. Perks of being a babysitter. Daily Total: $22.94",4,152
"7 a.m. — Cereal and coffee with almond milk for breakfast. 10 a.m. — I get to work. Free cookies again. The perils of working in an office. 1 p.m. — Lunch is leftovers from Tuesday night. 3:30 p.m. — I have to work late again, since I'm taking tomorrow off. So, I get an iced latte. It's rapidly becoming clear that most of my money goes to caffeinating myself. An iced soy latte from the café nearby is a treat, since it's so expensive, but it's the first really nice day we've had and I've used my gift card for most of the other coffees. $6 6:30 p.m. — I stop at CVS to pick up a prescription and a few essentials. I have a coupon that takes about $5 off my total. $20.12 8 p.m. — Dinner is portobello and red onion tacos with avocado. I got the recipe from Refinery29 ! 9 p.m. — It's laundry day. One load, wash and dry. $5.50 Daily Total: $31.62",5,152
"9 a.m. — I have the day off and treat myself to a bagel with tofu cream cheese at the local coffee shop. My biweekly direct deposit also comes in today. $2.90 10 a.m. — PJ Harvey is coming to New York this summer for the first time in years. I to get a ticket. $59.55 12 p.m. — A local tattoo shop is doing $20 tattoos for Friday the 13th ($13 tattoo + $7 tip). My friend and I went last year, but the line was so long we didn’t make it in. Luckily, I get there earlier this time and get in after a few hours. I get a small bird on my right thigh. $20 4 p.m. — On my way home, I pick up an iced tea. $1 4:30 p.m. — I missed lunch while waiting for my tattoo, so I heat up leftovers from last night. Leftovers are lifesavers. 7:30 p.m. — I go on a date with a writer I met a week or two ago at my favorite bar in Bushwick, Left Hand Path. He pays for the drinks and we have a really good time. Daily Total: $83.45",6,152
"11 a.m. — I’m on my way to the Upper East Side and grab an iced tea at the bodega. $1 12 p.m. — I go to the Bronx Zoo with three friends. We all manage to get in as ""students."" $14 2:30 p.m. — We stop at a snack bar inside the zoo and all get fries. $3.80 5 p.m. — It’s time to leave. Since we all have unlimited MetroCards and can’t use the express bus, we split an Uber back to the 86th Street Station. $8.50 6 p.m. — I make some pasta with broccoli and Gardein (vegan substitute for meat). Daily Total: $27.30",7,152
"8 a.m. — We wake up in Clear Lake, CA, just north of Napa county, and have breakfast at camp: oatmeal, peanut butter, and fruit, which we bought the week before. 9 a.m. — We stop at Kmart because I have NO MORE bike tubes, and I’ll be darned if I pop a tire with no spare tubes. $11 12 p.m. — Right around mile 20, we stop for lunch on the road: wraps with tofu, fruit, veggies and hummus, and chocolate (all good meals include chocolate). 2 p.m. — Fun fact: There is a mountain between Clear Lake and Calistoga, and Ellie and I are grinding it out for the next six miles, fueled by trail mix that’s actually mostly chocolate. The descent through the beautiful forest and then vineyards, however, makes the climb so worth it! 5 p.m. — We drop into Calistoga and are SO EXCITED to be in Napa County, clocking right around 50 miles for the day. We drop our bikes and go out to Thai food. Ellie and I split the cost. $22 7 p.m. — Drinks at Susie’s Bar (Ed note: supposedly Napa Valley's oldest bar), where we chat up some old locals and a few Danish guys on vacation. We each buy a round. $12 9 p.m. — We set up our tent at the Calistoga RV Park. There are a ton of signs that prohibit tent camping, and RV spots are $50, but we pitch our tent anyway and hope for the best. Daily Total: $45",1,153
"8 a.m. — We eat quickly, to avoid anyone kicking us out of the RV Park, and head to Healdsburg, which is about 20 miles away. 11:30 a.m. — Early lunch in Healdsburg. We splurge at Shed, a market/café, and get two premade salads, a slice of frittata, hummus, fancy cheese and crackers, and coffee. I cover both of us. $49 12:30 p.m. — We get a slice of pie with ice cream at Noble Folk for $7, which is absurd, but Ellie buys that. We’re doing great on time, so we walk around and poke into a few boutiques and tasting rooms. 2 p.m. — We strategically map our route from Napa County into Sonoma so that we miss any big hills. After two weeks of biking, we’re much stronger than when we started, and carrying less weight than at the start of the trip, but still. 5 p.m. — We end our 50-mile day in Forestville, and it turns out a friend’s sister lives there. We are crashing in her guest room for the night, so we offer to cook dinner. We pick up groceries to make pasta with roasted cauliflower and fennel, sourdough bread, and kale salad. Total comes to $28, but Ellie pays. 9 p.m. — We catch up and drink beers after dinner, but crash early since they have work and we have another day of biking tomorrow. Daily Total: $49",2,153
"8 a.m. — Same-same for breakfast — oatmeal, peanut butter, fruit. 10 a.m. — We stop in Guerneville to visit the Armstrong Redwoods Reserve, which are some of the most incredible trees! We meander through the forest before heading out of town, with a quick stop at Safeway. We get hummus, veggies, hard-boiled eggs, fruit, and CLIF bars for lunch, and soup, rolls, and an avocado to make avocado toast for dinner. $28 11:30 a.m. — We stop in Duncans Mills for a cup of coffee and a pastry at Gold Coast Coffee. The bear claws are worth a trip up the coast! $7 12:30 p.m. — After 16 days of biking due west, we spot the Pacific Ocean for the first time! We stop to eat lunch on the coast and then start biking along Highway One. 2 p.m. — This road is incredible, with rolling hills, windy curves, and views of the Pacific crashing on the rocky coast. We stop a few times to snap pictures. 6 p.m. — We get to Bodega Bay, our campsite for the night, and grab beers in town before setting up camp. $15, but Ellie pays. 9 p.m. — There are three other bike-tourers at the hiker/biker site: one from the Bay Area, taking a short trip; and two who are biking the whole coast, from the Mexican border to Seattle. We share beers with them, and then crash for the night. Daily Total: $35",3,153
"8 a.m. — We wake up to the sound of rain, and crawling out of the tent is tough. We cook oatmeal and pack the tent quickly, since biking in the rain is better than sitting in the rain. 10:30 a.m. — So now it’s pouring, but the rain is supposed to stop soon. We find shelter and grab a cup of coffee in Valley Ford. $3 12:30 p.m. — We stop in Tomales for lunch. I pick up a salad with house-smoked salmon while Ellie has a breakfast burrito, and we split a peanut butter brownie from the bakery. $15 2 p.m. — We’ve only biked six more miles, but it’s not like we can just bike past Hog Island Oyster Company and not stop! The rain has stopped, and we have a half-dozen grilled oysters while overlooking Tomales Bay. We’re offered beers but decide that would make it too hard to keep biking. $18 5 p.m. — We are staying with Ellie’s great aunt and uncle at their house in Inverness, so we pick up a bottle of wine at the deli in town, which Ellie pays for ($19). Picking a bottle of wine for a pair of 90-year-olds with a house so close to wine country proves to be more difficult than expected, but we settle on a bottle of Pinot Noir. 7:30 p.m. — Connie and Sandy are the coolest old folks and they cook us dinner, which includes the best cheese I’ve ever had, ratatouille, wine, and homemade apple pie. Daily Total: $36",4,153
"9 a.m. — Today is our last day of the ride! We have breakfast with Connie and Sandy, who make us eggs, tons of fruit, and sticky buns from Bovine Bakery in Point Reyes (also worth the trip from SF). 10 a.m. — Apparently, we picked the right route to SF, considering we avoided a huge climb up Mt. Tam, biked through a sweet state park, and are being constantly passed by people out for a ride. Multiple people have told us that we’re an inspiration, and my ego is growing. 12:30 p.m. — We roll into Fairfax for the first farmers' market of the season. I get a hummus plate for lunch and pick up fruit and samosas for lunch tomorrow. $17 3 p.m. — We stop at a grocery store in Sausalito, and I pick up veggies, hummus, and other snacks for my train ride tomorrow, as well as a handful of postcards to mail to family ($7.50 for 15). $21 4 p.m. — We cross the Golden Gate Bridge, stop and take pictures like tourists, and narrowly avoid getting hit by actual tourists on the bike path. 6 p.m. — Dinner with friends at Leaf. I have the Korean BBQ bowl and a beer and take home leftovers so I can drunk-eat later. $23 9 p.m. — We bike to Zeitgeist, where we meet up with everyone we know in the Bay area, which includes family, friends who live there, and a friend who’s also passing through. The boys buy pitchers of beer. 11 p.m. — We drag our bikes up four flights of stairs to my friend's apartment and crash on his bed while he takes the couch. What a guy. Daily Total: $61",5,153
"6 a.m. — I’m taking the Amtrak from Emeryville, so we get up early to take the BART. We stop at Starbucks because I am a miserable human without coffee. $6 8:30 a.m. — Box the bikes at the station, hugs for Ellie, then my train departs for Salt Lake City. I don’t have a phone (lost on day two of the trip), so I’ve stocked up on newspapers and a book for the 16-hour journey. The ticket is $89 and fee for the bike is another $25, which is way cheaper than flying. $114 2:30 p.m. — We have a 20-minute stop in Reno, so I run stairs for 10 minutes and do a few downward-facing dogs while people stare. Whatever, I hate sitting still. 5 p.m. — Dang it, not enough train snacks. So I buy pretzels, trail mix, and coffee. $9 8 p.m. — Nine hours down, seven to go. I have two seats to myself, so I get out my sleeping bag and crash. 3 a.m. — Train rolls into Salt Lake. Ellie flew to Alaska, so I have both our bikes, which I unbox, put together, and walk the three blocks to the hotel where my mom is staying. Once I’m inside, I thank my lucky stars no one gave me trouble getting in. I crash. Daily Total: $129",6,153
"9 a.m. — I say hello to my mom, whom I only sort of woke up last night, and we have breakfast at the hotel. I call my friend George, who recovered my lost phone (Woo!), and he drops it off. I wanted to grab a six-pack for him, but liquor stores in Utah are run by the state and don’t open until 11. 11 a.m. — My aunt comes to pick us up, so we load the bikes and drive to Park City. 12:30 p.m. — Girls' lunch at High West Distillery; I have a bowl of veggie chili and the best roasted Brussels sprouts. Mom’s treat! 3 p.m. — My bike bags explode once we get to my aunt and uncle's house, where we’re spending the night before driving to Aspen to visit my brother. I do some much-needed laundry, and then run to the store so I can cook them a thank-you dinner. $34 6 p.m. — I make roasted chicken, quinoa salad, a carrot tahini salad, marinated feta, assorted olives, pita, and a green salad. The old folks provide the beer and wine. We talk about the trip and then call it an early night, so I can pack and be ready to roll tomorrow. Daily Total: $34",7,153
"12 p.m. — I worked until 1 a.m. last night, so I wake up around noon and eat a banana and some turkey (together — it's so good, I swear!) before heading to the gym. I'd love to dish out for an Equinox membership, but it's much harder to find an excuse when there's a free gym in my building. 2 p.m. — I hate cooking. I hardly ever do it. I usually go out to at least pick up lunch because I can end up cooped in my place for days on end working and sleeping if I don't! Today, I go to Thai Tycoon and get a cucumber salad, a Thai iced tea, and Pad Mee Lao. $20 4 p.m. — I order from Thrive Market a lot because I don't have a car, and I don't ever want to do real grocery shopping. I pay an annual fee ($60) and get great food at discounted prices throughout the year. I order probably once or twice a month. This time I get: Guayaki energy shots, aduki beans, quinoa, jasmine rice, chicken broth, pickled jalapeños, five boxes of Annie's shells and white cheddar, tuna, a few boxes of pasta, a few Frontier soup mixes (the BEST!), tomato sauce, falafel chips, barbecue green peas, plantain chips, freeze-dried pineapple, a box of Mamma Chia Chia strawberry banana squeezes, Primal Kitchen Greek vinaigrette, and my all-time favorite thing (I eat the most of this and have to have it at all times): Udi gluten-free coconut peanut butter cookies. I also get Primal Kitchen Avocado Mayo as a free gift. $166 8 p.m. — After lounging around watching on Netflix, I head back to the gym for round two. Once I'm done, I eat the rest of my lunch for dinner and have a few seaweed snacks before getting ready for work. 9 p.m. — I start getting ready for work. Most days, it takes me an hour to get ready, with hair and makeup. There are some days when I just put concealer on, though. I usually work on my bed, so I also try to make my bed, clear any clutter you can see, clean toys, etc. 10 p.m. — I start working. I typically work nights around 11 p.m. to 2 a.m., sometimes earlier or longer depending on how much is coming in. The way it works is I have my main channel, where I chat with all my viewers, and I mostly just talk to them. I get ""tips"" in this channel — viewers buy tokens on the site, and they'll give them to me, sometimes just for doing nothing because they're feeling generous, or sometimes I'll set a price for something like flashing the camera. Each token gets me $0.05. I spend most of my time working private shows or group shows. I get 50 cents a minute for group shows, $3 a minute for private shows (and an extra $1 a minute if voyeurs ""secretly"" watch). A ""true"" private, without any voyeurs, gets me $5 per minute. 4 a.m. — I wrap up work. I ended up with six private sessions, two private sessions with voyeurs, four true private sessions, and five group shows. I also had a 20-minute private Skype show, which I charge $75 for every five minutes (I get paid directly through Paxum, a sex-work-friendly version of Paypal). Plus tips, I make a total of $1,478.65 before going to bed. Daily Total: $186",1,154
"1 p.m. — I wake up later than normal because I was up working late last night; there are some nights when people are being extra generous, and I don't want to stop working. I'm lagging today, so I skip the gym and meet a friend for coffee and lunch. I have a large coffee and a breakfast sandwich. $8 2 p.m. — I work almost every day and have a lot of clients who watch just as much, so I try to keep up by replenishing my underwear stock once a month so they aren't seeing the same thing all the time. This week is ""upkeep week,"" so it's going to be a little more expensive than usual. I head to Victoria's Secret and get 15 pairs of panties, four bras, and a pair of sweats (the sweats are just for me). I keep tabs of these work expenses, so I can deduct them at the end of the year. $250 5 p.m. — I eat a banana with almond butter. Was planning to go to the gym but I take a nap instead. 8 p.m. — I meet up with friends for drinks to celebrate a friend's birthday. I buy a round of drinks. $50 11 p.m. to 2 a.m. — I eat a bowl of granola, a banana, and a tuna sandwich before starting work. First up, a six-minute private with one voyeur, then three more private shows, and two group shows, plus tips. I make $480.95 and then eat some soup before going to bed. Daily Total: $308",2,154
"12 p.m. — Wake up and go to the gym. Afterward, I buy a lemonade and a sandwich before running errands. $12 3 p.m. — I get a blowout. I can't figure out how to do my own hair ever, so I get it done probably once a week, right before my busiest work days. This also gets deducted from my taxes. $70 4 p.m. — I'm in a slump. I get a large coffee and cookie. $6 8 p.m. — I go to a Disclosure concert with some friends. Buy a few drinks and a bacon-wrapped hot dog. Taking the night off tonight, so I can stay out later. $50 Daily Total: $138",3,154
"10 a.m. to 2 p.m. — I eat a bowl of granola with a banana before working for a little bit, since I took the night off. I end up with a nine-minute private session, a group show, and another private show. I make $62.15. 2 p.m. — I hit the gym and then meet a friend for lunch. I have a ginger beef quinoa bowl with a hibiscus kombucha, and we split an order of spring rolls. $20 4 p.m. — I go to Sephora and pick up concealer and highlighter. $70 6 p.m. — My Glossier Balm Dot Com I ordered a while ago comes in the mail. I love it so much, I buy three more online. $30 9 p.m. — I eat some soup and an almond-butter-and-banana sandwich (realizing I eat a lot of bananas) before work. 10 p.m. to 5 a.m. — Work. First, I create and edit a custom video for a client, for which I charge $250. I don't feel up for any private or group chats today, so I do a few special themed shows on my main channel: I have a strip show, shower on camera, use coconut oil, and paint my toenails naked. I make $566.15 (all in tips), finish up working, eat some soup, and finally go to bed. Daily Total: $120",4,154
"3 p.m. — I slept the entire day. I buy a large coffee on the way to a cardio barre class. $3 coffee, plus I re-up my five-pack of classes for $40. $43 4:30 p.m. — Again, since I have a lot of frequent viewers, I like to do new things to keep them coming back. I decide to go shopping for sex toys. I don't like anything that looks vulgar or plastic, so I buy things that are pretty and unique. I pick up the new Jopen Callie dual massager and a Bamboo rose-gold vibrator. I'll deduct these at the end of the year. $100 7 p.m. — I order a salad and burger on Seamless to eat while I watch Netflix before work. $25 9 p.m. to 3 a.m. — I work in the main channel for a little bit, then hop on a 60-minute private Skype show. This only happens once a month with a regular, but I get $900 for the Skype session. I also do a couple more private shows and a group show (another $79.15) before going to bed. Daily Total: $168",5,154
"12 p.m. — I wake up and then go to the store and buy bananas and ingredients for lasagna. $60 1 p.m. — I start making the sauce for my lasagna, I'm making it for a guy whom I've been seeing for awhile. He just got a promotion, and lasagna is the only impressive thing I know how to make. 2 p.m. — I eat a banana and some soup before working early so I can have the night free. 5 p.m. — I go buy a new dress from Aritzia for tonight. I'll pretend it's just something I had in my closet. $100 8 p.m. — He comes over with wine, and we have a nice evening. I eat way too much lasagna. Daily Total: $160",6,154
"7 a.m. — My guy gets some coffee and a breakfast sandwich before he heads to work. 10 a.m. — I can't get back to sleep, so after lounging around and doing nothing, I go to the gym. Afterward, I go to Walgreens and buy toothpaste and a Snickers. $8 12 p.m. — I get a Brazilian and brow cleanup, which I'll also deduct from my taxes. It's exhausting to keep track of, but helps so much when it comes to tax time because I generally owe a lot! I don't write off makeup, though, because I use it in my everyday life. $75 1 p.m. — I'm starving. I text a friend to meet up for lunch and order a fried-chicken sandwich, collard greens, and a bottled water. $15 3 p.m. — My glasses broke. I order a new pair on Warby Parker. $95 6 p.m. — I grab happy hour drinks and snacks with friends. I buy a round and some fries. $55 10 p.m. — I eat the rest of my lunch for dinner before getting ready for work. In the last two hours of this diary, I make $371.90 off one private session and a group show, plus 7,198 tokens for tips. Daily Total: $248",7,154
"7 a.m. — I make coffee at home while I pack my lunch for work. I put leftover farro, cucumbers, tomato, and roasted chickpeas in a tupperware last night after dinner, so I just drizzle it with some homemade tahini dressing and cut up some fruit to bring with it. After getting ready, I commute 40-50 minutes by subway to get to work in Manhattan. 8:45 a.m. — Payday! I check my bank accounts to see that $1,112 has been deposited. This amount is after taxes, $125 for health insurance, and $117 (plus a company match of $87) to my 403b. I have $25 automatically transferred to my emergency/long-term savings account, bringing it up to $3,260. My goal is to get it to at least $5,000, and most months I contribute something extra, but this is the minimum. I plan to put an extra payment towards my student loans this month. $213 10 a.m. — Tickets go on sale for a band I really like (The Hush Sound). It’s a special reunion tour, so I deem it worthy of my entertainment budget funds. $20 10:15 a.m. — I grab a packet of oatmeal and a spoonful of Trader Joe’s super-seed blend from my desk and use the hot water tap in the office kitchen to make breakfast. 1:30 p.m. — I eat at my desk while finishing up my work for the week. I work at a Jewish school, so we get out early on Fridays. 2:30 p.m. — I have some time to kill, so I pop into Madewell and notice that a dress I’ve had my eye on for a wedding this summer has finally made its way to the sale rack. Alas, they don’t have my size. I check on my phone and see that it’s available online...but without the extra 30% discount. I mention the situation to an employee, and she says they’d be happy to order it for me, with free shipping plus the discount. Score! I usually budget $50/month for shopping, but I saved it last month in anticipation of this purchase. $70 4:30 p.m. — A close friend from college is in town after a few years abroad, so I take the subway up to Columbia to meet up with her and another girl, and then back downtown together to Agave for happy hour drinks. I have two $6 margaritas. We’re going to dinner next, so another girl pays and we decide to settle up after our meal. 5:30 p.m. — My friends didn’t eat lunch, so they’re starving. We go to an early dinner at Crooked Knife. We order a bottle of wine to share and I get the shepherd's pie. It takes us too many tries to work out the math on the bill after the wine, but we manage it. I usually only go out to dinner once every month or two, so this is a special occasion. $42 7:45 p.m. — It’s still early, and we’re having a blast catching up, so we move on to Art Bar nearby and switch to beer. We linger over two rounds and eventually split the tab. $15 10:45 p.m. — I resist the urge to stop for a snack and grab the subway home. Daily Total: $360 (yikes!)",1,155
"8 a.m. — I get up feeling a little thick-headed, so I drink yesterday’s coffee over ice with two ibuprofen. 9 a.m. — I work a volunteer shift once or twice a month at the Metropolitan Museum of Art library, and today’s my day, so I grab a banana and head to the subway to get there by 10. I have a Dunkin Donut’s gift card, so I stop on the way for a hangover-ameliorating bagel with cream cheese and another iced coffee. I use up my gift card and pay the difference. $0.78 12:30 p.m. — Sometimes I’ll pack a lunch, but I usually save my treats for volunteer days and get a coffee and/or lunch out. Today I stop by Butterfield Market and pick up a steak quesadilla to eat in Central Park on my break. $8 7 p.m. — On my way home from the subway I stop at my neighborhood grocery store to grab some milk and a few other items. I aim to spend $250 a month on groceries, plus another $50 or so for alcohol and eating out, so it’s usually closer to $300. I make some mac-and-cheese with broccoli and chicken for dinner at home. $10 Daily Total: $18.78",2,155
"11 a.m. — Today I just want to relax and enjoy my day off. I lounge around my apartment, reading and catching up on TV. I make some oatmeal with blueberries and peanut butter for a late breakfast. 3:45 p.m. — I clean my kitchen and bathroom and then eat my leftover mac-and-cheese dish. 5:00 p.m. — I finally drag myself out for a run, then come home and do some strength training in the living room. 7:30 p.m. — I shower and pull a veggie burger and an English muffin out of the freezer for dinner, with some carrots on the side. Daily Total: $0",3,155
"9 a.m. — I’m going to a professional development workshop this morning, and it doesn’t start until 10, so I get to sleep in a little. I make coffee at home and grab a complimentary granola bar at the event. 1:30 p.m. — I’m back in the office for the afternoon and eat a salad that I’ve brought from home. It’s romaine lettuce with a hard-boiled egg, tomato, corn, cranberries, pecans, and a basil-greek-yogurt dressing. 7:00 p.m. — Dinner is a veggie burger again, this time with some homemade sweet potato oven-fries and broccoli. I watch with my roommate, and we compete against each other. Daily Total: $0",4,155
"10 a.m. — Coffee from home and oatmeal at my desk again for breakfast. 1:15 p.m. — I eat a ham-on-rye that I brought with me (surprise!). 2:00 p.m. — I’m encouraged to take a full break outside the office, so most days I do. I try to stick with walks and necessary errands, but occasionally some shopping happens. Today I grab shampoo at Harmon ($7) and then go to Trader Joe’s to pick up some coffee and somehow end up with kale chips and dried coconut too ($9). $16 5:30 p.m. — I head to the gym after work. It’s not the best, but you can’t beat the price, particularly in NYC. 7:30 p.m. — Dinner is an egg scramble with leftover sweet potato from yesterday, spinach from the freezer, and some salsa I had in the fridge. If I ever have a bag of fresh spinach that’s on its last legs, I throw it in the freezer. It’s great to crush up and add to just about any dish. 8:00 p.m. — Netflix and chill (the non-suggestive kind). Daily Total: $16",5,155
"10 a.m. — I change it up with some cut fruit and a hard-boiled egg from home for breakfast. Plus coffee, of course. 1:30 p.m. — Lunch is another salad I brought, similar to Monday. It can be kind of a pain to prep and transport two meals a day to work, but it’s so much cheaper and usually more delicious. 7 p.m. — I make another quick stop at the grocery store after work to pick up some frozen vegetables, lettuce, and a few other things. For dinner, I make a grilled ham-and-cheese sandwich on rye, with some of the frozen squash that I bought. $15 9 p.m. — My evening’s entertainment is a physics course that I’m working my way through on Coursera. I was recently reminded how much I enjoyed my high school AP class, so now I’m challenging myself to see how much I remember of Newtonian mechanics. Yes, I’m a nerd. Daily Total: $15",6,155
"10:30 a.m. — Same breakfast as yesterday. 1:30 p.m. — Today’s salad creation features salsa, corn, and cheese. I wish I had some black beans. Also brought a banana and some almonds that I snack on through the afternoon. 5:30 p.m. — I make it to the gym again today. I stop on my way home from the subway to pick up my laundry from the wash-and-fold, which I do every two or three weeks. I know it would be cheaper to do it myself, but when I think about the hours saved it really doesn’t seem too bad. I dream of a day when I have laundry in my building. $18 7:45 p.m. — Dinner is another veggie burger with the leftover squash, plus some peas and carrots from the freezer. I swear I don’t usually eat so many, but all the weekend excitement meant that I didn’t do my typical batch-cooking, so this is what happens. Must plan meals better next week. 8:30 p.m. — I pack for a bachelorette weekend trip to Lake Placid. I’m definitely at the age where all my friends are getting married, so I have a permanent line item in my budget to save for all the various expenses. This trip was paid for several months ago, so all I have to worry about tomorrow is splitting gas with my roommate (who, conveniently for me, has a car). Daily Total: $18",7,155
"9 a.m. — WFH this morning and make myself a Vietnamese coffee with condensed milk, then head into the office. 12 p.m. — I’ve spent the last two weekends traveling (Tel Aviv and Rome, respectively), so I have had zero time to grocery shop and cook at home.

"8 a.m. — Morning Pilates class (from a package I bought previously) 9:30 a.m. — Feeling lightheaded since I haven't eaten since lunch yesterday.

We have a great time getting to know each other, and I'm disappointed we only met so late on her trip. I treat her to dinner at Sager & Wilde. $92.52 11 p.m. — I go to a ""members only"" club in Soho. My friend grabs drinks. Daily Total: $140.95",3,156
"9 a.m. to 5 p.m. — I work from home today, make lunch at noon, do more work. 7 p.m. — Meet up with a coworker before a concert. He has the munchies, so we go to McDonald's. He pays for this bad decision. 8 p.m. — We rock out at the Leon Bridges concert in Brixton. 11 p.m. — I'm heading home with a friend? A friend with benefits? With just benefits? Not sure, but going with the flow. Daily Total: $0",4,156

I treat her to Thai lunch. $28.91 1:30 p.m. — I wander around Brixton market and pick up a Matt & Nat wallet and a cute black skirt from The Keep . $88.18 4 p.m. — Tube over to Borough Market area. Need a cappuccino, and queue in Monmouth. $4.34 5 p.m. — I leave my friend and make my way home, stopping by Waterstones to buy books for friends.

I buy by Gabriel García Márquez, by Jhumpa Lahiri, and by David Sedaris. $39.03 6 p.m. — I stay in tonight to read and watch the Masters Tournament on the telly, with a late-evening dinner of eggs, tomatoes, and toast.

Catch up with my regular climbing partner, whom I haven’t seen in months. Bought an 11-session package ages ago. 5:30 p.m. — Stop by Tesco to buy some necessities. $8.67 6:30 p.m. — I receive my HelloFresh order! I don't have time to cook anything, so I just bake a frozen pizza before the concert. 8 p.m. — I head out to see my friend’s band, Nova Neon, play a Sofar gig in London. Super fun experience as always. I chat up the MC and get his number; we start texting and making plans for something later in the week. Daily Total: $41.92",6,156

She owes me for our most recent trip to Rome, so I don’t need to pay anything. 7 p.m. — I leave the office, faff around on the internet reading nonsense, snacking on bread and hummus. College diet, much? 9:30 p.m. — Put in another hour of work before bed. Daily Total: $13.74",7,156
"8:30 a.m. — I come into the office early to get a few things done before the day picks up. I am super tempted to stop for a coffee on my walk in, but decide against it. I’ve been really trying to cut out extraneous spending. I resign myself to my office’s horrible coffee and eat a yogurt and an apple that I brought from home at my desk. My roommate also had some extra smoothie that she made this morning, so I have some of that, too. 12 p.m. — I run to a midday yoga class. The class is covered through my ClassPass membership, but I pay $2 for a mat rental. $2 1:30 p.m. — A vendor comes to our offices and brings lunch. I don’t go to the meeting, but am able to steal lunch, a Greek salad, anyway (score!). 3 p.m. — I order some more Vital Proteins Collagen powder for smoothies, since I’m almost out. I started using it when I read the Jennifer Aniston also uses it, but have totally become obsessed with it. It has a ton of protein, and it’s great for joint and skin health. $24 7 p.m. — I go over to my BF’s. I pick up mixers for cocktails on the way. We have drinks on his roof and then head to Mermaid Inn for dinner. We are both starving, so we feast: We split octopus, mussels, fries, salmon, tuna, and a bottle of wine. He pays. He makes significantly more than I do, so we’ve figured out a loose system where he pays for the bigger tickets items (dinners, shows, and most travel expenses) and I chip in where I can (movie tickets, coffees, brunches, etc.). We also do a fair amount of cooking and when we do we split the grocery bill. $2 Daily Total: $28",1,157
"8:30 a.m. — Today is a VERY exciting day, because my AC is getting installed. I moved in February and it’s time that I finally pony up for one. Since my window faces the street, my building requires that I get it professionally installed so that it (hopefully) doesn’t fall out the window. Obviously, this is an unusual purchase. It’s kind of pricy, but I knew that it would be a large cost, so I saved some of my tax return to cover it. $450 9 a.m. — I eat a piece of Ezekiel bread and make a cup of French press coffee at home while the AC guys are installing my unit. 10 a.m. — I stop at the hardware store on my walk to work. I need to pick up an AC extension cord for my new unit. I also grab some dish soap while there, because we’re almost out. $24 12:30 p.m. — I have lunch that I brought from home. Veggies and a piece of gluten-free pizza. My roommate and I are challenging ourselves to not buy lunch at all in June. So, that means mostly packed lunches. I did this for the whole month of December and it’s amazing! You save SO much money. 6 p.m. — I take the subway uptown to have dinner with my parents before they see a show. I get a bun-less veggie burger and we split onion rings and fries. 8 p.m. — My roommate and I have some annoying apartment stuff to take care of (cleaning, organizing, etc.), so we decide to have a few glasses of wine to make the process more enjoyable. This quickly devolves into each of us having a bottle of wine and painting our nails while we watch . My roommate covers the wine, because she knows I’m feeling very poor after paying for my AC. Daily Total: $474",2,157
"8 a.m. — I am embarrassingly hungover from the previous evening. I stop and get a coffee and egg whites on gluten-free toast on the way to work in the hopes that this ameliorates the situation somewhat (it doesn’t). $6 11 a.m. — I meet a friend who’s visiting from out of town for a lunchtime barre class (covered through ClassPass). We grab coffees after and she offers to pay! 2 p.m. — I just told my bosses I’m going back to school in the fall. We worked out a plan for the next two months and they put me in charge of finding my replacement. They took it surprisingly well, but I was so nervous and worked up about it beforehand that I didn’t really have an appetite for lunch. I finally eat a little soup that I had brought from home. 4 p.m. — I’m still feeling “under the weather.” Good thing I brought a massive coconut water from home this morning. I chug it as I post job listings online trying to find my replacement. 6 p.m. — After leaving work, I walk over to my friends apartment for dinner (sushi) and wine before going to karaoke for her birthday party. I pay for the wine and my sushi, as well as giving her my portion of the karaoke fee. $74 9 p.m. — We karaoke the night away. Luckily, unlimited drinks are included in our initial cost, so my night is relatively cheap. Around 1 a.m., I walk over to my boyfriend's place and call it a night. Daily Total: $80",3,157
"9 a.m. — I wake up hungover and anxious (such a good combo). I run to La Colombe to grab coffees for myself and my BF. I can’t stomach anything besides coffee before my workout class. $9 10:45 a.m. — My friends and I have booked seats at SoulCycle this a.m., and my boyfriend decides to join. I have a SoulCycle package, so I booked my bike earlier this week and just pay for water and shoes at the class today. $4 12 p.m. — After class, we I go to brunch nearby. The place is pretty well-priced, but because we’re a large group, we all have to spend at least $30 each. Feeling up for the challenge, I order a Bloody Mary and an egg white omelette. We also get a few orders of avocado toast for the table. As a side note: Most of these weekend activities are abnormal, because my friend from college is in town. We tend to spend much more money when she’s around, because she wants to be out and about in New York. $41 3 p.m. — After the longest brunch in history (the food was great, but the service as horrible), we hop in cabs up to Hell’s Kitchen to my friend’s boyfriend’s place. They have a backyard/patio situation and it’s a great day out. My friend pays for the cab and I pick up some rosé for us to enjoy. We keep joking that it’s better to keep drinking and just lean into it than to let ourselves get hungover. When I’m around my college friends like this, we all revert back to the crazy drinkers we were in college. $14 6 p.m. — My boyfriend and I decide to leave the party. Since we’re already halfway uptown, we decide to stop at his parents' place and play with their dog before dinner. He pays for the cab. 8 p.m. — We head back downtown to grab dinner at Rosemary’s, an Italian place right by my apartment. The dinner is great, but we’re both feeling a little exhausted from the day's activities. He covers the bill and we head home. Daily Total: $68",4,157
"8 a.m. — I’m up early again, because when I drink, I can’t sleep late at all! This is annoying, but also somewhat convenient, because I have to catch an early train out to the suburbs to visit my family. I buy a ticket online, but charge it to my parent’s credit card. 9:30 a.m. — I grab a quick egg white sandwich and coffee on my way to the subway. I know it’s going to hurt my stomach later, because of the gluten, but it’s so worth it at the moment. $4 11:00 a.m. — My dad picks me up at the train station and we head to the grocery store to pick up some last-minute goodies for my brother’s graduation party. 12:30 p.m. — My mom has made an spread of food for the party. I pile my plate with poached salmon, green salad, crudités, eggplant dip, and frittata. I’m particularly excited, because I know there will be a ton of leftovers that I will get to take back to the city with me. I spend the next several hours chatting and catching up with a ton of family and family friends that I haven’t seen in a while. 5:30 p.m. — The party winds down and my family heads out to dinner at The Cheesecake Factory. I unabashedly love this place. Their tome of a menu means that everyone will be happy, and we always get cheesecake at the end. I order a salad with grilled chicken and eat a decent amount of my brother’s nachos and my mom’s avocado toast. I love being home. 7 p.m. — We get back home and watch a movie and chill before calling it an early night. Daily Total: $4",5,157
"8 a.m. — I wake up and pack up half of my parent’s fridge and pantry into my bag. I stock up on leftovers from the party, as well as my leftovers from dinner last night, and a few other things, like fruit and Larabars. My mom also sends me home with some peonies from her garden! She drives me to the train station and I again buy a ticket on my phone and charge my parents. 12:15 p.m. — Pop out of work for a midday barre class. My office is well-located to a ton of fitness studios and it’s pretty common in our office for people to get their workouts in during the day. The class is covered through ClassPass. 1:30 p.m. — A package gets delivered to me at the office. I’m not sure what it is, but then I open it and realize that my friend has messengered me eggplant parmesan that she made last night. It looks amazing and I can’t get over how cute it is that she surprised me with it. I decide to forego my leftovers for lunch in favor of this, with some crudités I had leftover from the party. 6 p.m. — My boyfriend and I meet up to cook dinner. I bring over some quinoa I have lying around, and we stop at Whole Foods for shrimp and veggies. We got really into making quinoa bowls when we were training for a race this spring, and now we make them fairly regularly. I pay for the groceries, but he Venmos me for half of it. $14 Daily Total: $14",6,157
"9 a.m. — I grab some coffee and a yogurt and some cherries that I have in the office fridge for breakfast. 12:30 p.m. — I run to a spin class at lunch, again through ClassPass. Back at the office, I have my leftover salad from the Cheesecake Factory. 6 p.m. — On my walk home, I stop by my local grocery store for some necessities: Greek yogurt, eggs, and raspberries (organic and on sale for $1.99!). $15 7 p.m. — My roommate and I have a date to deep clean our apartment. We used to have a service come, but we got so offended by how much they were charging for our tiny apartment that we decided to do it ourselves. We treat ourselves to dinner at an Italian restaurant that we live above. Wine was definitely involved. $30 Daily Total: $45",7,157
"8 a.m. — Walk the dog to our usual weekend coffee place, get two iced lattes and two BBQ brisket kolaches (not the Czech kind — the Texas kind, which is kind of like a pig in a blanket but with various types of meat. So delicious, so bad for you). We get a free latte today for filling up our loyalty card, which happens far too frequently. $15.50 10 a.m. — Go to the grocery store to pick up food for a BBQ at our friends’ house, and for the rest of the week. On the menu for the week is: sweet ginger chicken thighs with roasted veggies (three meals each for lunch); meatloaf burgers topped with caramelized onions, cheddar cheese, and BBQ sauce with roasted green beans (two meals each); lemon garlic fish with roasted potatoes (two meals each), and red curry pork with snow peas, carrots, and bamboo shoots over rice (two meals each). We pick up ingredients for spinach artichoke dip and rosemary lemonade to bring to the BBQ tonight, plus a six-pack of craft beer, which makes the weekly grocery shop a bit more expensive. We also grab milk, eggs, and other essentials. I pay (my husband and I trade off). $113 12 p.m. — We eat leftover spaghetti with garlic bread from last week’s dinners for lunch. 6 p.m. — Head to our friend’s BBQ to eat smoked pork and ribs along with spinach artichoke dip. We ended up spiking our lemonade with bourbon, and it was a huge hit — and extremely boozy, so we stay out way too late. Daily Total: $128.50",1,158
"8 a.m. — Wake up and make breakfast. We eat some eggs, French press coffee, and some frozen waffles. We're trying to clean our our freezer before Friday to make room for a quarter of a steer and a lamb that I bought at the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo, which is a charitable organization that helps provide scholarships for kids. You pay fair market value per pound of meat, and then an additional amount as contribution for scholarships, the latter of which is tax deductible. I paid about $1,000 for 60 pounds of meat, but I get to deduct $900 of that from my taxes. 10 a.m. — Head to REI to check out hiking gear for a trip to Peru later this year. We’re hiking the Inca trail, so this is definitely not a normal purchase. Buy two pairs of hiking boots and two pairs of wool socks for my husband and myself. I pay for everything, and hubby agrees to buy the backpacks at a later date. Why is being active so expensive? At least everything is on sale. $289 12 p.m. — Grab lunch at Chipotle on our way home because we’re starving and I have a BOGO coupon that expires today. So one burrito and a burrito bowl with guac only comes to $7 . 2 p.m. — Head to a friend’s place to take advantage of her pool and lay out. She provides drinks, but I only have one beer because it’s way too hot out to really drink. I mostly stick to water. 6 p.m. — Make dinner of roasted potatoes and lemon-garlic fish. Also prep the marinade for the ginger chicken to throw on the grill tomorrow and cook all the veggies for lunch. 7:45 p.m. — Run to a local ice cream place for some snacks prior to tonight (we’re obsessed and, fun fact, I walked down the aisle to an acoustic version of the theme song; it sounds amazing). Coffee and salted caramel for the hubs and chocolate brownie over a unicorn-bait cookie (sugar with rainbow sprinkles) for me. $12 Daily Total: $308",2,158
"8 a.m. — Make scrambled eggs and hash browns for breakfast at home before walking the dog. 12 p.m. — Make the meatloaf burgers for lunch with the roasted green beans. Finish prepping lunches for the week while doing laundry. 3 p.m. — Attempt to walk the dog to a local brewery to hang out and cash in a few free pitchers of beer that we’ve collected, but it’s closed for the Memorial Day holiday. Settle for grabbing two six-packs of beer from the corner store and relaxing in our backyard. $22 7 p.m. — Make pork curry for dinner with groceries from earlier in the week. Daily Total: $22",3,158
"8:30 a.m. — Back to the office. Buy a latte from the Starbucks kiosk in the office (they have almond milk!) after dealing with the post-holiday traffic on the way to work this morning (Houston drivers are the worst). Bring a bagel from home to eat. $4 12 p.m. — Go to a workout class in the work gym over lunch and almost die since I took the past five days off. Drink a protein shake after (I keep a huge tub that I got on Amazon Prime in my office). They are so gross, but I need the protein. 1:30 p.m. — Heat up sad desk lunch of the grilled ginger chicken and veggies. The Brussels sprouts got soggy in the reheat. Gross. But I still eat them. 2 p.m. — Work is having an ice cream social to boost morale, since oil has been low for so long. Snag a bottle of water and a kind of disappointing dark chocolate ice cream bar. 5:30 p.m. — Walk the dog then start dinner prep. Lemon-Parmesan-crusted fish with the leftover potatoes from day two and a beer from day three. Daily Total: $4",4,158
"6 a.m. — Head to the work gym for a personal training session. These are like $32.50 for 30 minutes, so pricey but worth it, and I buy the bulk 20-class pack about once every other month, so I’m still using up classes on my last pack. I drink another protein shake afterwards. 8:30 a.m. — Toast an English muffin that I brought from home and coat it in vanilla almond butter that I keep at my desk. 9 a.m. — Cave and get a latte at the Starbucks kiosk with a coworker. $4 11 a.m. — Head home to meet the mobile groomer and eat lunch. Our labradoodle is very high-maintenance, and Houston is hot as balls in the summer, so the dog gets a cut every four weeks. And he always looks just like a bobble-head afterward, because we keep his head hair longer. While the dog is getting his groom on, I heat up a leftover meatloaf burger and green beans for lunch. I burn the bun for my burger in the toaster, but eat it anyway. Groom is $115 plus a $30 tip, so $145. This is really a monthly expense that happened to fall on this week. 12:30 p.m. — Stop by the coffee shop a block from our house because I need to break a $20 to have a $5 bill for my Bunco group tonight. Use it as an excuse to get an iced latte and a peanut-butter-cup doughnut. This place is expensive, but it’s local, and the staff members are super sweet. $6.50 + $1.50 tip, so $8 . 2 p.m. — Split the doughnut with a coworker. 5 p.m. — Head home and walk the dog in between rainstorms. Stop to chat with some neighbors and am gifted with a Wamosa (watermelon juice and champagne). Score! 7 p.m. — Bunco night. Last year, a group of 12 from my neighborhood started getting together and playing Bunco, taking turns hosting. Tonight, we are playing Pokeno instead. Wine and light bites are provided by the hostess. There’s a $5 buy-in, but tonight I am the big winner, so I get my $5 back, plus an extra $20. And I end up good and tipsy because we decided to turn Pokeno into a drinking game. Daily Total: $12",5,158
"7:30 a.m. — Wake up late and hungover AF. Forget to grab an English muffin on my way out the door for breakfast. Fail. 8:30 a.m. — Grab a latte and coffee cake at the work Starbucks to combat the hangover. $7 9:30 a.m. — I pay a lab invoice from my Ob/Gyn’s office for $17.78, but it comes out of my HSA account, so no real cost to me. I also get an email reminding me that my dog is almost out of doggy-day-care days. The spoiled pooch goes every Friday, so I can feel less guilty going out on Friday nights instead of to the dog park. $150 for a five-pack of day-care passes, calculated in monthly expenses; I love my dog to death, but he’s a pricey little booger. Pet ownership is expensive. 12 p.m. — Lunch workout class. Nearly died again. I need to step up my cardio. Drink a protein shake after. 2 p.m. — Lunch of grilled chicken and veggies again. 3:30 p.m. — Grab another latte with a coworker while we creep on the rain from the skywalk over downtown Houston. We end up being really lame and taking an ""ussie"" (a selfie with more than one person), but you can’t even tell it’s raining in the pic. $4 7 p.m. — Reheat leftover pork curry and rice for dinner. My husband is on campus studying tonight, so I plan to stay in and watch some online web-design tutorials. 8 p.m. — My friend calls, and she’s had a rough week at work. It’s finally stopped raining, so we agree to meet up for margaritas. I take an Uber, and she picks an expensive place. I’m glad I at least already ate dinner. $34 Daily Total: $45",6,158
"8 a.m. — Drop the dog off at doggy day care. I have to get gas on my way into the office, and I am one of those people who will run the tank down to basically empty before filling up. Drives my husband crazy. $37 9 a.m. — Need a latte because I am once again hungover. So irresponsible. $4 10 a.m. — It’s National Doughnut Day! A few coworkers and I make a trek to claim a free glazed doughnut at one of the Shipleys (Texas doughnut institution) nearby. I pick up a few extra for some other coworkers and have to pay for them. $3 1:30 p.m. — Walk with coworkers to grab a quick bite to eat. Go for an ""unwich"" from Jimmy Johns since it’s cheap and I can pretend it’s “healthy.” I also get chips and a drink. I try not to go out to lunch, and I should have eaten my chicken, but I ran out of veggies, and it is Friday. $10 4:30 p.m. — Leave the office to pick up my quarter of a steer from a fellow rodeo volunteer’s house. Luckily I’ve already paid for the 30 pounds of steaks. I have two beers and snack on chips and queso while socializing. 7:30 p.m. — Go out to dinner with the husband. We go to a neighborhood place and get wine and a cheese board to split. I order pasta, and hubby gets some sort of sandwich with fries. My husband pays, so we can take advantage of triple points on his Chase Sapphire card. We never combined finances after getting married. Daily Total: $54",7,158
"7:40 a.m. — I wake up late (again) so I dash out the door with a Kind Bar for breakfast to eat on the commute. I take the bus to the subway station because I’m running late; usually I’d walk the 15 minutes there for some exercise. 8:20 a.m. — Arrive at work and head downstairs to the coffee cart. I get a small drip coffee and an orange juice. Since I work at a university, the food here is pretty reasonably priced and tax free. $3.50 11:30 a.m. — I’m getting peckish so I eat a Reese’s Cup someone sent me in the campus mail! 12:10 p.m. — My husband transfers me $33 for his share of the tickets to see Hall and Oates in July, but then he also requests $30 from me to pay his Dad for my monthly phone bill. 12:40 p.m. — Head out for lunch. I should bring lunch from home to save money, but my schedule is so busy at the moment I don’t feel like I have the time to prepare, cook, and clean. I’m in-between classes at the moment though so I don’t really have a good excuse this week! I walk ten minutes to Whole Foods and get the hot bar – mac and cheese, tofu, and Moroccan chickpea salad. It’s a weird mix but it’s good! I also get a Stevia cream soda. I usually eat a “paleo-esque” diet 80% of the time but sometimes I relax the rules – I love mac and cheese! I also try to only eat fish and chicken because I feel terrible about the treatment of farm animals. It’s not perfect, but I feel it’s a step in the right direction. $9.12 2:20 p.m. — Coffee time. I need a pick me up. I keep a jar of instant coffee granules at my desk to save money. I just use hot water from the break room. 3:15 p.m. — Buy a book for my summer quarter class that starts next week. I find a second hand copy on Amazon. $12.95 5:30 p.m. — Take the CTA a few stops further than home to go to Trader Joe's. I buy dried mango slices, pastrami-style smoked salmon, gummy penguins, two pre-packaged salads, cherries, gluten free granola, cocoa almond butter spread, four Think Thin bars, and four Spindrift seltzer water sodas. I walk home for more exercise and eat some gummy penguins on the way. $43.38 6:30 p.m. — Eat dinner. Gluten free toasted rye bread with smoked salmon and seltzer water. 7 p.m. — Time for laundry. It’s in the building but I have to go down to the basement. One wash and dry costs $2.50; I use quarters from the jar that my husband filled recently so no cost to me there. 8:00 p.m. — Chill evening watching Netflix and reading. I didn’t go for a run tonight since I did a lot of walking today. Daily Total:  $68.95",1,159

They forget to bring out my beer since the set came with a drink, but I'm full by the time I realize anyway, so my total comes out to $16.36. 1:45 pm — It's such a gorgeous day out and I'm just itching to be outside. I grab my laptop from home and work from a neighborhood bakery. I feel weird for only getting a tea at a bakery, but their patio is gorgeous with way better Wi-Fi than the nearby coffee shops. $3.45 6 p.m. — Meet my husband at home and notice our housekeeper stopped by — so fresh and so clean. He grabs the leash and takes our kitten for a walk around the apartment compound garden (she's a Bengal and BEGS for it) while I drop off some dry cleaning. It comes out to $16.62, but his company will give us 10% back. $15.01 6:30 p.m. — Forgot to order groceries today and they’re still on a walk, so I run to the supermarket in the mall across the street. It's a pretty expensive, foreign goods store that we try not to shop at too often, but I find a box of quinoa pasta on sale and grab a pack of Riega Alfredo mix. I add some chopped broccoli and crushed red pepper to it at home and — dinner served! $4.80 8 p.m. — Crack into a gifted Compartes donut chocolate bar to celebrate being able to breathe again! Clocking into our typical weeknight routine: watching TV while sprawled on the couch. Daily Total: $39.62",3,162
"7:22 a.m. — I finished up the week’s work yesterday so I could have the day off. I wanted to sleep in, but end up waking up to my husband’s alarm. I lay in bed and pay a few bills on my phone (all of which are monthly occurrences). 8:30 a.m. — Get to yoga early, so I lounge around with a cup of tea (free). I’m in the meditation room, but end up people-watching — everyone around me is on their phone. Yup, I’m definitely in China. 11:30 a.m. — Play with the cat and eat leftover pasta for lunch. 12 p.m. — We’re doing a huge road trip through Italy in a few months and plan on staying at an estate with a name that matches our last name. It's definitely an abnormal splurge, but way too cool to resist. It’s a super-remote, farmhouse-style B & B and they typically don’t do online payments, but I’ve convinced them. I pay the deposit. $77.65 3:45 p.m. — Our guests are in town! Our driver picked them up from the airport and dropped them at our place. They settle in and we head to the mall across the street for a snack and some grocery shopping. I buy them some mochi to try for the first time. We also run to the supermarket to buy kid-friendly snacks, which they insist they pay for. $3.59 6 p.m. — We meet my husband at home after walking them around the neighborhood a bit and crack open a few home-brews. 7 p.m. — We rarely have guests, since it’s pretty expensive to come out here from the U.S., but when we do, we always take them to the same place for their arrival dinner. It's a foreigner-friendly Sichuan restaurant with a basil cocktail that's to die for — and is walking-distance from our house. Since we have a kid with us, we order the least-spicy items on the menu, so it ends up being something new for us all. We handle the bill, of course. $61.14 9 p.m. — Consumed by jet lag, they head to bed early. We were invited out, but decide against it. Netflix in bed sounds way more appealing. Daily Total: $142.38",4,162
"9 a.m. — Our guests wake up early and try to considerately prepare breakfast on their own, but I forgot to prep them on the outlet conversions! They accidentally blew the Keurig we brought from home, so we run out to get them some coffee and breakfast. There isn't much open yet, so we grab them some coffee and dumplings at BaoBao. Super fatty — and I'm not on vacation — so I make myself cereal with the groceries from yesterday. $4.48 11 a.m. — I've been dying to try the beautiful day spa down the road and thought it'd be the perfect opportunity to pamper our guests. My husband and his cousin get massages while his daughter and I get mani-pedis. Total was around $134.74 for us all, but our cousin firmly insists that he pay. We make a promise to catch him back with food. 2 p.m. — We take a taxi to the fabric market to get custom suits made for the boys. We don't have much on our transportation cards, so we refill both our cards with $14.97 each. The taxi comes out to $5.09 , but I pay with the transportation card. Total :  $29.94 3:30 p.m. — High tea time! We take a taxi over to The Bund. This is definitely an abnormal event for us all. I've always wanted to do a fancy tea party, which I knew the visiting 8-year-old would also love, and the skyline view from M on The Bund is spectacular. It's the perfect amount of food, since we flew past lunch. It's our treat. $90.75 5 p.m. — We take a ferry across the river, so they can get the full skyline experience. It's 30 cents each, but my husband and I use our transportation cards and our cousin pays for their entrance separately. 7 p.m. — We hop in a taxi to dinner after walking around a bit. It's pouring at this point, so we're feeling like the luckiest alive to have found one. It comes out to $5.09, but we pay with our transportation cards again. 7:30 p.m. — Dinner at D.O.C! I chose this place because of their gorgeous patio, but it's raining like no other, so we don't get to experience it. It's cozy and warm inside, so no complaints, and the food is great. We're happy to treat our guests again. $102.29 10 p.m. — Back to bed a little earlier than usual for us, but we're exhausted after all the excitement, anyway. Daily Total: $227.46",5,162
"8 a.m. — Waking up early for dentist appointments. Our driver takes us over and our guests explore the area while my husband and I are at the office. 11 a.m. — My husband's out before me, so he grabs some breakfast with our guests. $36.32 11:50 p.m. — I'm finally done! I'm always the one who gets stuck sitting around and waiting. We prepaid for our appointment, which our insurance paid us back for, so I'm good to go. I'm starving by the time it's all over, so my husband grabs me a veggie burger from one of my favorite cafés. $7.77 1 p.m. — I have another doctor's appointment, so our driver drops everyone else off at an American restaurant that's hosting a big Fourth of July cookout. I'm a little jealous, but they promise to save me some crawfish. 1:30 p.m. — The total for the appointment and my prescription comes out to $387.81, but is covered by our insurance. 1:45 p.m. — Meet everyone back at the cookout. Husband buys beer and food tokens and saved some crawfish for me, which I completely forget how to break open and proceed to get juice all over the place. $29.90 2:30 p.m. — There's an ancient water town nearby that the guests are really excited about, so we head that way afterward. Our driver drops us off and we meet a local friend of mine at a Starbucks. I'm tired already, but I'm trying to cut out coffee. I grab a green tea latte, instead. $5.68 3 p.m. — It starts to rain and we're down one umbrella. I grab one from a guy who set up a DIY umbrella stall by the water town entrance. $2.24 3:15 p.m. — We make a few stops around the town: ice cream for the 8-year-old, a few throws at archery for my friend and I, and lots of water bottles for us all. It's all really cheap. $1.49 5:30 p.m. — Exhausted and ready to be home! It's a far walk to the subway station and the 8-year-old has had enough of the day, so we hail an Uber back home. $11.21 6:30 pm — We’re way too tired to go out to eat, so I decided to make dinner for the bunch. The boys go grocery shopping, which our cousin insists he pay for, while I take a quick shower. I make everyone grilled cheeses and tomato soup and I prepare myself a pot of quinoa spaghetti. 7:45 p.m. — Our guests are doing a little trip of their own to Beijing the next day, so I’m preparing sandwiches for their train ride. The guys walk to a nearby cigar shop to and grab some goodies, which our cousin pays for. 8:30 p.m. — A relaxing night of home-brews and cigars on our patio. Daily Total: $94.61",6,162
"7:30 a.m. — Back to the grind. I wake up early to sneak in a yoga class before work. 10:15 a.m. — I’m loving this 8-year-old...she’s convinced her dad that ice cream’s appropriate breakfast food, so we’re out to grab a sweet treat before their train. This is something I can get behind. She’s a doll and treats me to a matcha soft serve cone. 11:55 a.m. — The guests are off to Beijing with the driver, so I set up shop on the patio for a day of work. 3:55 p.m. — Quick break to sneak in a late lunch of leftover spaghetti 7:30 pm — Our housekeeper stops by. We pay her monthly to do our dishes, vacuum the rugs, mop, and scrub up the bathrooms and kitchen. She insists that her job doesn’t feel complete until she’s made the beds and folded the laundry, so she sometimes does that, too. She doesn’t this time, since I decide to conquer the laundry while watching TV. 8:45 p.m. — My husband’s on a work trip as well, so I’m on my own for dinner. Feeling super lazy and don’t want to mess up the dishes our housekeeper just did, so I make myself some toast with the leftover groceries. Then, straight to snuggling into bed with the kitty and watching Netflix until I’m asleep. Daily Total: $0.00",7,162
"8:30 a.m. — Bought a coffee and a pastry from Konditori. I get coffee there often because it's just across the street from me. $ 5.25  10 p.m. — I worked late and didn't feel like cooking or eating healthy, so I order in buffalo wings and a large pizza. $ 28.74 Total: $33.99",1,163
"8:30 a.m. — Free latte from Konditori because I filled up my loyalty card! Yay. 12:30 p.m. — It's a busy day at work, so I order Chop't. $ 13.13 8 p.m. — Leftover stir-fried greens from over the weekend, plus leftover pizza for dinner. Total: $13.13",2,163
"11 a.m. —Coffee and an avocado toast sandwich to eat for lunch from Hole in the Wall, the Australian coffee shop near my work. I should get the avocado toast for lunch more often. It's so cheap and good. $ 10.00 7:30 p.m. —  I grab dinner with a friend. Ramen and a winter root vegetable dish from Ramen by Mew, on the cheap because there's a special —$5 for each bowl of ramen! $ 10.00 9 p.m. — Bought two cocktails at The Up & Up, one for me and one for my friend to celebrate her (belated) birthday. $ 34.49 Total: $54.49",3,163
"9:30 a.m. — Had a cup of the nasty free coffee at work. 1:30 p.m. — Leftover Chop't salad. 8 p.m. — Leftover pizza. 8:30 p.m. — I order a mini fabric steamer on Amazon because I got new curtains, and they're too long to steam in the shower. Plus not all clothes come out wrinkle-free after a shower steaming, so it'll definitely be useful for that. $ 29.99 9 p.m. — I've been pretty unhappy and inundated at my job lately, so I impulse buy a beauty treatment on Gilt City. Oops. $ 59.00  12 a.m. — A guy I'm seeing wants to hang out, so he sends me a Lyft. I wouldn't usually stay up so late on a school night, but I'm trying to make the most of any time I'm not at work, and he has his adorable dog, who he shares with his ex. 1 a.m. — We do some cocaine. I don't know how much drugs are supposed to cost, but I heard coke is pricey. I just did a line because it was offered, and I was drunk. The alcohol was free, too. Total: $88.99",4,163
"9:30 a.m. — Nasty office coffee again. 2 p.m. — DIY tacos leftover from a catered meeting for lunch. 8 p.m. — I order wings and a veggie burger for dinner. I used to not be able to get good buffalo wings when I lived on the Upper East Side, but I moved to Brooklyn in August, and I've been indulging. $ 16.16 Total: $16.16",5,163
"4:30 p.m. — Sangria and pizza from Fornino with a guy friend who lives near me. $ 28.95 5:30 p.m. — My friend's ""buddy"" gets back from vacation the next day, so he needs to buy condoms from CVS.

"12:30 pm — First date latte from Sweetleaf. Free. 2 p.m. — We head over to brunch at Trix. He's really nice and just moved to Brooklyn from rural Virginia. He literally grew up on a farm, and I was his first date since moving to NYC. I don't think he knows that first dates aren't usually on a weekend. It was refreshing to not have to pretend to be less available than I actually am. 7:30 p.m. — I finally run out of pizza (my roommate's houseguest had some), so I heat up a Zhongzi (meat, peanut, shiitake filled sticky rice wrapped in banana leaf) that my grandma made and gave me the last time I visited home. 9 p.m. — Order a paperback copy of by Celeste Ng on Amazon. $ 10.66 11 p.m. — Spontaneous first date beer at No Name Bar. Different guy. We had been talking for a while, but hadn't met up because his schedule is nuts. I usually wouldn't go out so late before a workday but I wasn't feeling ready for work yet so I decided to go. I think he may have been a little drunk already. The conversation was pleasant enough, but he mentioned that he's short-tempered , which is a deal breaker for me, so I doubt we're going to hang out again. Total: $10.66",7,163
"5 a.m. — I spend my morning running errands. I pick up a passport for an upcoming trip and stop by Whole Foods for some quick “healthy” breakfast ingredients — Greek yogurt and green juice. $5.49 Noon — Forgot to bring leftovers from dinner last night for lunch, so I have to resort to our super-expensive food court at work. Does a Dos Toros salad count as healthy? $10.75 6 p.m. — Rush home to move my bed out of my apartment. The boyfriend is taking it to put in the guest room at his place. Since I’m running late (yay, work issues before the weekend), I hop in a cab. $26.15. 8 p.m. — Dinner is homemade! And since we're at the boyfriend’s house, he buys the groceries. We make whole wheat pasta in a garlic white wine sauce with hot Italian sausage, spinach, and kale. $0 Total:  $42.39",1,164

I have one hard-boiled egg and a small cup of oatmeal with blueberries and cinnamon. $0 9:30 a.m. — My new bed frame and mattress are finally delivered! And thanks to white glove delivery, they also assemble it. Tip the guys $20 each. $40 Noon — I stop by my local Japanese store to pick up a quick snack. No big meal today, because we have a farewell dinner party tonight, so I grab some onigiri for myself and two friends, plus some iced tea. $9.54 4 p.m. — Bloomingdale's sales are my weakness. I pick up the softest cashmere turtleneck sweater on sale from All Saints. We’ll see if I end up returning it. $201.60  5:30 p.m. — Pre-dinner drinks for three in Union Square as we wait for the crew to show up for dinner. I end up not paying for dinner, because the boyfriend insists on treating. $ 31 8 p.m. — Fiasco with the kitchen renovation! The sink I ordered is too big (double basin sinks require 36” cabinets at a minimum, apparently). So I return the current sink (I’m refunded $353.21.) and order another sink that actually fits in our space ($463.33). $110.12 Total: $392.26",2,164

Total: $90.29",7,164
"Noon: Lunch at Hale & Hearty. I go to Hale & Hearty probably three times a week, either for soup or salad. Their soup is cheaper; salads are for like a ""treat yourself"" day.

I buy drinks for me, the writer, and Starlee Kine (!) for the interview/shoot.

David Bowie was my teenage idol, and it feels wrong not to do something in the wake of his death. $25 7 p.m. — I get home from work and realize I'm out of cat food.

"10 a.m. — Coffee from Stir Crazy. $2.25 8 p.m. — This one I regret. My current dinosaur laptop is going out on me, and I occasionally edit YouTube videos and shorts, so I go into a third-party Apple store (my first mistake) with the intention of browsing. The sales people are pushy, so I walk out with a good computer (upgraded to 16 GB RAM, 500 GB storage, and two graphic cards; so great for light editing). The terms of the financing were terrible, though. They only asked for $40 down, and I told them I could do more, but they kept pushing that I could make overpayments to the finance company later. $40 10 p.m. — I go to Pavilions again for cat food and water. $9.80 Total: $52.05",4,166

He's a theater nerd, and I have a feeling he will love it; plus, we realized early on that we would rather spend money on experiences than physical gifts. Doubly pumped that $30 tickets for under-30s are available, so the tickets end up being $64 instead of $160 — discount win! 3 p.m. — Late lunch from home: roasted sweet potatoes, Brussels sprouts, and beets, with quinoa and some leftover avocado from breakfast, topped with massive amounts of Sriracha. I also snag a free tea from the office kitchen to warm up. $0 7:30 p.m. — I have a serious case of the Mondays, and all I really want is a burger. Instead, I make my roommate's famous cheap meal, the ""hot sauce burrito:"" vegetarian refried beans, sour cream, and massive amounts of hot sauce. It's the best greasy-food satisfaction for zero dollars. I also snack on leftover brie and crackers we got for the Super Bowl party and a glass of the Rioja that's already open, because the most important night of TV (re: ) deserves a little something. $0 Total: $69.50",1,167

Saving ~$25 feels better anyway. $8.25 7:15 p.m. — Dinner at home, and again not in the mood to cook, so it's instant ramen with an egg on top (don't judge; my ""recipe"" is delicious) and leftover chocolate babka from an event last week. $0 Total: $12.25",2,167

I pay for what I can, because it makes me feel guilty to have him pay for me every time.

I typically try to eat out only once or twice a week, but I have a feeling this bachelorette weekend is going to feature a lot of food stops.

Noon — Chipotle sent out coupons for free burritos a few weeks ago. I just remembered mine probably expires soon, so I check and it indeed expires in two days. I opt for a chicken burrito bowl. Got charged for the guac because I asked for it on the side instead of inside the bowl (even though it should be covered by the coupon no matter where it’s placed). I will definitely be sending feedback about this inconsistency. $2.28 5 p.m. — Grabbed a large box of mixed greens from Safeway because the plan is to make smoothies with my boyfriend for dinner while we watch some basketball (go Warriors!), and I can use the greens for other meals later in the week. No need to get fruit because there’s some at work that’s ripe that I can salvage. $5 8 p.m. — The game ends and my BF insists on getting a “real” dinner instead. We go to Ramen Halu and get some Tsukemen (dipping ramen). He pays, since it was his idea. Total: $7.28",1,172
"7 a.m. — Fruit delivery arrives at work! There’s avocado, so I make avocado toast sprinkled with black pepper and drizzled with honey, plus a cup of Philz Coffee. Noon — I have half of my Chipotle bowl left from yesterday’s lunch. To spruce it up, I add half an avocado from this morning’s breakfast to the bowl. I also have an apple from the fruit delivery. 2 p.m. — My roommate texts me to remind me that the fridge water filter needs to be changed soon. It’s $24.25 for one, but we will split it three ways at the end of the month along with the other utilities. $8.09 6 p.m. — My BF and I make a trip to Costco after the gym so we can prepare lunches for the rest of the week. We buy chicken breasts (12-pack), red bell peppers, Freekeh (it’s a grain with tons of protein and fiber, and the consistency is somewhere between quinoa and rice), and Himalayan sea salt. We prep three lunches for each of us for the remaining workweek, and still have six chicken breasts and three bell peppers left for future meals. $41 8 p.m. — Dinner. My boyfriend picked up sandwiches from our favorite sandwich place, Freshly Baked Eatery in San Jose, earlier, and we make healthy smoothies (finally) with the greens and fruits from yesterday. 10 p.m. — I remember that Bloomingdale’s texted me a unique coupon code in the morning that is only valid for today, for 20% off almost everything. I do need new jeans and bras (haven’t bought new ones in 2+ years). I buy a couple of different options, so hopefully I’ll be returning at least half my order. My order comes out to $416, but I have $425 in Bloomingdale’s rewards cards from my Christmas splurge when they did an amazing promotion. $0 Total: $49.09",2,172
"7 a.m. — There’s one avocado left that hasn’t been claimed, so I must take advantage of it! Disclaimer: I love avocados; 99.99% of girls do. Breakfast is avocado toast with Philz Coffee again, plus half a Fuji apple. Noon — Grilled chicken with roasted bell peppers, steamed broccoli, side of Freekeh. 3 p.m. — Usually at this time, I would be heading to the gym while thinking of what cost-efficient and semi-healthy food I want for dinner — but not today. My friend had a rough weekend involving a boy, so she needs emotional support. We meet for beers and play Connect Four at Freewheel Brewing Company in Redwood City. $6 5 p.m. — Pit stop at Martin’s West Gastropub in downtown Redwood City for the best quail Scotch eggs, because we’re never in Redwood City together. No shame in not ordering drinks and just splitting one order of eggs, though I’m not sure our waitress felt the same. $6.50 each 6 p.m. — We continue our journey in downtown for braised pork shoulder, polenta cakes, and the infamous spicy Sausage & Honey pizza at Vesta, plus a glass of wine. $35 each 8 p.m. — We aren’t too far of a drive away from my favorite dessert ever, a dark-chocolate soufflé with an Earl Grey crème anglaise at The Village Pub in Woodside. My friend hasn’t experienced its deliciousness before, and this is already turning into a ""treat yo'self"" kind of night, so might as well go all out. Besides, we figure this might be the cheaper option compared to our alternative, which was to peruse Nordstrom Rack in Palo Alto. We share a rich, fluffy dark-chocolate soufflé and a small pot of coffee. We’re both happy with the decision we made. $12.50 each Total: $60",3,172
"7 a.m. — I have half an avocado from yesterday’s avocado-toast breakfast, and it’s not going to stay green for much longer, so avocado toast it is again. Plus, Philz Coffee. Noon — Grilled chicken with roasted bell peppers, steamed broccoli, and a grapefruit from the work kitchen. 2 p.m. — My friend bought two season tickets for the San Francisco Giants, and he’s selling off roughly half of the games. He has pretty good seats, so I decide to buy his tickets for a game against the Rockies in June. He’s selling them for face value to friends, and these were only $49 each (for lower-level seats along the first-base line!). Earlier in the year, I had referred another friend to his company, from which he was able to reap referral benefits, so he insists on letting me have these tickets for free. $0 6 p.m. — Oops, BF and I forgot that we can’t have meat tomorrow because of Lent, so we end up having our prepped chicken-and-veggies lunches as dinner tonight instead of lunch tomorrow. Total: $0",4,172
"7 a.m. — No more avocado toast for me, so I won’t get tired of it. Back to Justin’s Almond Butter, toast, and French-pressed Kona coffee. Noon — I’m working from home today, so I can access ingredients in my fridge. Healthy smoothie of mixed greens, blueberries, half a banana, chia seeds, and almond milk; all ingredients I usually have in my house. 2 p.m. — My friend makes me go to Target with him because he needs help picking out gifts for his 1-year-old nephew. I decide to pick up toilet paper for the house (I divide the cost by three) and some condoms because safe sex is good sex. I save $10 because Curbside offered $10 off to celebrate Leap Year. $9.65 3 p.m. — Friend wasn’t able to complete his grocery purchases at Target, so we walk over to Trader Joe’s. I didn’t even really need any groceries, but made the mistake of walking through the frozen aisle and got self-coerced into buying an arugula burrata prosciutto flatbread. Also convinced myself to try the pineapple version of Ballast Point Sculpin IPA because I love Sculpin and I love pineapple, so can’t go wrong. $19.24 6 p.m. — It’s Lent and Fridays are meatless, but seafood is fair game. BF and I venture to Go Fish Poke Bar in Cupertino for poke bowls. $22.40 Total: $51.29",5,172
"9 a.m. — My BF and I make breakfast at home after a nice morning workout. Eggs, mushrooms, sautéed peppers; all ingredients left over in the fridge. Noon — Since I’m going to be heading up to San Francisco, I stop to fill up on gas just in case. $38 1 p.m. — I meet my friend in the Richmond for pho at Turtle Tower before her hair appointment. We see each other just once every two to three months at the most, so whenever I have plans to come up to S.F., I also try to make time to see her. She insists on treating because I made the drive from San Jose to S.F. $0 2 p.m. — Since my friend treated me to lunch, I treat her to dessert and coffee. We find an unassumingly cute and hipster coffee shop in the Richmond called fifty/fifty and get lavender Earl Grey lattes (super-good!). $8 4 p.m. — I didn’t make it to my friend’s birthday celebration last weekend (because I’m so over clubbing in S.F. now). I figure I owe him a hangout/drink. The original plan was to go to Biergarten in Hayes Valley and drink beers while playing Settlers of Catan, but since the line to get in was so long, we settle for Blue Bottle Coffee and Settlers on the grass at the nearby park. $5 7 p.m. — One of my college girlfriends is in town for work from Hawaii, so a bunch of us meet up for dinner at La Nebbia in Noe Valley. We order two appetizers, four pizzas, and two bottles of wine for the 10 of us. I love offering up my credit card to foot the bill and having everyone send me money on Venmo later, so I can get the points (hehe). $25 each  10 p.m. — One of my friends from dinner catches a ride from me to head back down to San Pedro Square in San Jose for a coworker's going-away celebration. My BF and I decide to tag along to hang out and grab drinks, but we only stay for an hour. We try to leave a $20 bill for the table to cover our drinks before we leave, but my friend’s coworker shoves the money back to us and tells us not to worry about it. $0 Total: $76",6,172
"8 a.m. — Finally using up the last of those breakfast ingredients from yesterday morning. I discover that eggs can actually last for quite a while beyond the printed expiration date. (Look up the egg-freshness water test.) 12 p.m. — I meet up with my BF and our friend after church. We decide to get lunch at Layang Layang in Cupertino because the food and portions are good, and we all haven’t been in a while. We order one appetizer and two noodle dishes, and share it family-style. $10 each 2 p.m. — It’s almost the last day of February, and BF and I still haven’t gotten Smitten’s Earl Grey Chocolate Chip ice cream (its February flavor). We’ve been meaning to try it since February 2014, but somehow manage to miss it every year. Spoiler alert: It’s delicious. He pays. $0 7 p.m. — Dinner plans with my friend who I don’t see very often anymore now that she’s a grad student. We go to Dan Izakaya and share a sashimi salad and a seared-salmon rice bowl. $18 each Total: $28",7,172

But hey, I won a prize from my World Beer Tour Card at the party! I treat my boyfriend to a beer since I dragged him along ($13.43). Total: $32.51 3:15 p.m. — After the party, we head to meet a realtor at a house I'm scheduled to see. We realize we don't have enough gas to make it across town, so I fill up a full tank of gas. $17.44 4:30 p.m. — I drop by Jo-Ann Fabric to get some ribbon to replace the ugly leather ties on my Ugg boots. $5.49 7 p.m. — double date with another couple. My boyfriend buys the tickets, I buy the pop and popcorn with a coupon. $11.40 9 p.m. — Drinks with friends at 2 Dogs Pub. My boyfriend was quicker in pulling out his credit card so he pays.

I throw my friend some gas money ($10). Total: $18 3 p.m. — I wake up still feeling really bad, but figure I should try to eat something. I have Jimmy John's delivered and then don't feel like eating it. I end up taking Motrin for my fever. $12.00 9:30 p.m. — I run out of supplies and my fever is still climbing, so I call my mom.

My co-pay is $0. 4:30 p.m. — I have a respiratory infection. The physician's assistant at QuickCare sends me straight to the emergency room for IV fluids and a chest x-ray. At least I don't end up getting admitted. They make me drink some Sprite before I go because my blood sugar is low. We'll find out in a few weeks how much the coinsurance is for the x-ray and fluids, but the co-pay for the visit is $50. 8 p.m. — My boyfriend brings me an almond chai tea latte and then my friend takes us all back to my place.

We split the cost. $13 4 p.m. — Two Kombucha because I've been thinking about them all week. $8 4:30 p.m. — I make mac and cheese for dinner because I'm hungry. I use AmazonFresh weekly, which was delivered at the beginning of this week, and even though it's supposed to cost $299 a year, I've used four different emails for the 30-day promo, so groceries are around $50 to $60 a week for my boyfriend and me. I can't believe the promo still works. 5:30 p.m. — I put the ClassPass to good use and go to yoga. 7 p.m. — I pick up my jumpsuit at the tailor. I am trying to stop buying fast fashion, so I'm buying slightly nicer more expensive pieces and getting them tailored.

Total amount spent: $40",3,174

But I am not going to carry a wet, sweaty towel with me to work, so I just pay it every time. $3 10:30 a.m. — This was dumb, but I kept thinking about food in yoga. I walk to Starbucks before work and grab an iced coffee and breakfast sandwich. $6.50 2 p.m. — I eat the chicken tacos I packed for lunch. 3:45 p.m. — Snack on a free tea and cookie at work. 6:15 p.m. — I take the bus as close to my house as it gets without transferring, while explaining to my BF on the phone how to make some lemon butter garlic fish with asparagus and potatoes (some superwoman stuff here).

Time for a phone call to order my favorite chicken sandwich as takeout. I feel no regret as I get melted cheese all over my face. $12.77 11:00 p.m. — After an evening of chilling out on the couch and extensive research, I book four nights at a hotel in Europe as part of a trip my boyfriend and I are planning for the spring.

Plus, I can expense it to the company. $15.14, but it's expensed, so $0. 10:00 p.m. — Amazing birthday dinner with friends at Awadh on the Upper West Side. They take the check when I go to the bathroom. I am given a firm “no” when I offer to contribute. 10:30 p.m. — Birthday party for a friend at a bar in Harlem.

Husband pays for it. 6:30 p.m. — We take our dog to a dog café, which serves both doggy and human food.

"6:00 a.m. — I leave my house to go to the gym at my office. This is actually the first time I'm doing this, but I never have the energy to go to the gym after work. I'm also a very routine morning person with coffee and the Getting ready takes me forever, so this is going to be a big change in my life if I can keep it up. 8:00 a.m. — Monthly payment for my season tickets to NYCFC, the professional soccer team that plays at Yankee Stadium.

I get dinner and drinks with a friend every other Tuesday. We try to keep it cheap. $16 Total: $91.25",2,177

"10 a.m. — I get a breakfast burrito, grapefruit, and side of potatoes for breakfast delivered. I didn't really eat a real dinner, so I was hungry. $19.28 2 p.m. to 7 p.m. — I go shopping with my sister and a friend. I don't really go shopping all that often, but once or twice a year, we go out to a mall. Today is that day. I use my tax return money to buy: - Lululemon pants and a pair of capris. Yes, I know they are ridiculously priced but they are just amazing and I only buy them a few times a year. Plus, I believe if you like your workout clothes, you'll go to the gym more. $206 - A nice Madewell blouse for work and going out. $59.50 - A J. Crew linen shirt and hair accessory. $57.48 - Two throw pillows for my couch from Crate and Barrel. $85.50 - A MAC powder blush and brush cleaner solution at Nordstrom. $39.95 - Two bath towels, two hand towels, and a bath mat from Restoration Hardware.

"10:30 a.m. — I visit my alma mater for an interview and decide to stick around to chat with my graduate advisor. I'm starving afterwards since I didn't eat breakfast. Another three hours on the bus without food sounds unappealing, so I quickly order an egg white omelet and a raspberry muffin from the student cafe. Cue nostalgia. $7.80 11:00 a.m. — I proceed to get on the bus and pass the f*ck out. $26.00 6:30 p.m. — I stop by my local grocery store. I typically try to shop on the weekends, when sales are taking place. I qualify for federal assistance so I receive $194 per month for Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) EBT and try to budget around $30 to $40 a week, with the surplus used to buy splurge items that aren't part of my core staples (ice cream, interesting fruit), or groceries for my parents. Today, the store has a sale on grapes. Some Cheez-Its and goat cheese find their way in my basket too. Oops. $12.50 7:00 p.m. — I walk back home, fix myself a dinner of grapes, goat cheese, crackers, and leftover pork buns my mother so graciously made for me. Then I crack open my latest library find: Atul Gawande's . Best Friday ever. Total amount spent: $46.30 ($12.50 from EBT)",1,178
"6:30 a.m. — I wake up and get ready for work. The bulk of my patients are busy during the weekdays so I try to meet them on Saturday mornings. I make a berry smoothie from my stash of frozen fruit and have a square of caffeinated chocolate my friend gave me. 10:00 a.m. — I'm hungry. I eat some cheese and crackers I brought with me. 12:30 p.m. — Lunch is leftover pizza from my mother that she gave me when I visited her last weekend and some grapes from yesterday. 1:00 p.m. — I decide to return some books to the library, and then I head to my local community center to hit the elliptical. My community center gym membership is a steal at $30 a year. 2:00 p.m. — Refreshed after my workout, I walk to my local Chinese grocery store, where they have dirt cheap sales on the weekend. I snag two papayas, four eggplants, one bag of pea shoots, and a bottle of soy chili paste. $12.82 (EBT) 3:00 - 5:30 p.m. — I volunteer at the local women's shelter so I help with dinner prep. Afterwards, I fix myself a plate of mashed potatoes, BBQ chicken, and broccoli, a nice volunteer perk. Yum. 7:30 p.m. — I head over to the Fenway area to celebrate my friends’ birthdays with dinner and clubbing. Since I already ate earlier, I opt for a pear margarita at the restaurant and cranberry vodka at the club ($22.27). I resist the urge to Uber home at the end of the night, even though public transport takes forever (approximately one hour). Can’t forget the cover charges as well; we go to two clubs, with a $5 cover each. Total: $32.27 1:00 a.m. — I arrive back home with the drunchies and finish off my Cheez-Its from yesterday. Total amount spent: $45.09 ($12.82 from EBT)",2,178
"10:00 a.m. — I wake up feeling surprisingly productive and prep various lunches for the week and today. Since I teach cooking classes at work, a lot of these ingredients are leftovers. Win! I make some bacon carbonara, roasted sun dried tomatoes and asparagus, yu xiang eggplant, and steamed egg whites with scallions and crab. 1:00 p.m. — It’s such a gorgeous day out, so I walk with my roommate to our local grocery store. Food shopping is my version of retail therapy, so I grab some frozen fruit, some pumpkin bar mix, bananas, grapes, and garlic bread. The pumpkin mix and the garlic bread were both finds from the discount shelf — I always try to buy dry goods on sale that can be used later (beans, rice, lentils, or cake mix). $15.68 (EBT) 3:30 p.m. — I get hungry again, so I polish off my goat cheese and crackers, as well as a papaya. 8:00 p.m. — Roommate dinner! We make stir fry pea shoots, garlic bread, and strawberries with balsamic vinegar. Total amount spent: $15.68 from EBT",3,178
"7:00 a.m. — Breakfast is some overnight oats with chia seeds and soy milk from the pantry. I inhale another square of caffeinated chocolate. 10:45 a.m. — Exciting news! I receive a graduate school interview through email. I quickly book my plane ticket, courtesy of my parents. I’m lucky to have parents who are able and willing to invest in my education (and will expect all the money back, of course). $340.20 (Parental contribution) 12:00 p.m. — Lunch is bacon carbonara, grapes, and papaya. 1:00 p.m. — I book a hotel for the interview as well. $97.98 (Parental contribution) 6:30 p.m. — I take advantage of the current sale at the Chinese mart again and get two boxes of strawberries, two papayas, a pack of my favorite spicy ramen, eggplants, and scallions. $15.57 (EBT) 8:00 p.m. — Dinner is leftover steamed eggs and crab, eggplant, and strawberries. Total amount spent: $453.75 ($438.18, parents; $15.57 from EBT)",4,178
"7:00 a.m. — I’m running late so I eat some papaya before rushing out. 9:20 a.m. — Fruit for breakfast doesn’t cut it, so I pull out my work stash of crackers and cheese. I also have some tea (my coworker and I are the type of people who receive lots of tea as gifts), a banana (leftover from the after-school program I run), and a random sugar cookie I found in the break room.  11:00 a.m. — I eat another sugar cookie and fix myself another cup of tea. 12:00 p.m. — I eat my packed lunch: leftover bacon carbonara, eggplant, some grapes and strawberries. I tend to cycle through favorite dishes until I get tired of them. 6:00 p.m. — I finish volunteering at the women’s shelter again and receive a mini-sized pineapple pie. I save it for later. 7:00 p.m. — I unsuccessfully battle the urge for Burger King. After chicken nuggets, fries, and an Oreo shake, I feel mildly disgusting. $6.52 8:00 p.m. — I get home and I’m out of underwear and socks, but don’t feel like paying the coin-operated washer and dryer for such a small load. I wash my garments by hand in the kitchen sink and hang them on the drying rack. 10:00 p.m. — Pre-bedtime snack of strawberries and balsamic vinegar. Total amount spent: $6.52",5,178
"7:00 a.m. — Some cut up papaya again and a square of caffeinated chocolate. 12:00 p.m. — I accompany my coworker to a local grocery store during our lunch break because all I packed for lunch was fruit. The place is mad expensive. I get some honey BBQ chicken tenders, crackers, and a pack of lemon squares for later. Good thing the chicken tenders were refrigerated, because my EBT money cannot be used for hot, prepared foods. My actual lunch is just the packed fruit (papaya and strawberries) and half the tenders. The lemon squares will be saved for when I’m having a down day. $17.65 (EBT) 6:30 p.m. — I stop by an alumni reception at Harvard Medical School to network with current students and other healthcare professionals. I eat enough fancy appetizers to count as dinner (braised mushrooms, baked brie and baguette slices, chorizo paella, and lots of calamari). Everything tastes better when it’s free! Total amount spent: $17.65 from EBT",6,178
"7:00 a.m. — Mixing up breakfast with a bowl of horchata and granola. I get sick of foods pretty easily, so it’s important for me to have a wide variety of breakfast staples in my pantry. 12:00 p.m. — The rest of my chicken tenders, some eggplant, and papaya and grapes for lunch. 6:30 p.m. — My friend comes over for dinner, and I go all out. I make eggplant, garlic pea shoots, honey-ginger-soy salmon, and rice. I always have a huge 20 pound bag of rice on hand, and I usually keep pre-portioned frozen salmon fillets in my freezer. I buy big fillets from Costco at $5.99 a pound (permanent price) and portion them separately. Usually about $20.00 will be enough for approximately two months. Total amount spent: $0.00",7,178
"9 a.m. — I was good last night and packed my breakfast AND lunch, despite the fact that I had to finish before going to bed. I have some Greek yogurt with oats, raisins, and honey packed in a super cute Mason jar. I'm not a coffee person, so I either bring tea or get it at the office. Noon — My artwork was chosen to be in a gallery show, so this isn't going to be an average week. I have to get my photographs printed and framed. I pick them up from a printer friend in Flatiron during my lunch break. $246 6 p.m. — I need to ship the prints, so I buy a box and send them on their way via UPS. $40 8 p.m. — I went to the grocery store last weekend and stocked up for about $50 because I'm trying to eat out less. I love to cook, and I find it keeps me healthier and sticking to a better budget! I collect recipes from all over the internet (R29, Buzzfeed, food blogs) and store them in my email, typically meals without a ton of components, so it's more affordable. Tonight I make a pineapple chorizo rice bowl with avocado cream. It's delicious, and I have plenty of leftovers for the week. Total: $286",1,179
"9 a.m. — I did major breakfast prep last night and made oatmeal for the rest of the week. I sauté some pears and put that in the oatmeal with walnuts. I have tea in the office. Noon — I packed my dinner from last night for lunch. 7 p.m. — Time to pick up some face cream from the pharmacy. For the past year-and-a-half I have been using a prescription gel called Ziana for acne, but with my new insurance that would've cost me $400. My derm wrote me a prescription for the generic version, but it still costs a ton. Thankfully I found a savings coupon online because this stuff is not cheap. I also buy Witch Hazel. $110 8 p.m. — I have leftover chicken soup and oatmeal for dinner. Not sure why I wanted those two things together. Total: $110",2,179
"9 a.m. — I bring my breakfast again, same thing as yesterday. Noon — It's my friend's last day at work, so we go out to lunch. We head to a little bakery place and I get a mediocre salad and cookie. We manage to get a nice sunny table in Bryant Park, so that makes up for the overpriced salad. I also grab an iced tea on the way back to work. $17 8 p.m. — I eat some more leftovers for dinner. Total: $17",3,179
9 a.m. — Same thing for breakfast again! Noon — I take a walk and drop off some film to be developed. Somehow I end up with an iced tea in my hand before returning to the office. I eat more leftovers for lunch. $3 8 p.m. — Lo mein for dinner. It took me about 30 minutes to make. Total: $3,4,179
"9 a.m. — I have the same thing for breakfast again. I'll need to shake things up next week. Tea at the office. Noon — Leftovers for lunch, then pick up the film I had developed. $26 5 p.m. — While waiting for my friend to get out of work, I buy another iced tea. I don't normally spend this much at Starbucks in one week, but oh well. $2 7 p.m. — I meet a friend on the Upper East Side for dinner at her favorite Greek restaurant. She knows the owner, so we get a few glasses of wine for free. $33 10 p.m. — Buy a Gatorade. Hydration is the key to life (and not being hungover). $3 11 p.m. — My friend and I make it back to my apartment and have a drink there. Then, we go to a local beer garden. $8 Total: $72",5,179
"9 a.m. — I make some pancakes and eggs at home. Noon — I go sell some old clothes at Buffalo Exchange. I get $20 in store credit and buy $50 worth of clothing. I then go to buy toothbrushes at CVS ($8), before stopping for a bagel with egg salad on the way home ($5). $43 9 p.m. — MORE leftovers for dinner (seriously time to hit the grocery store). Total: $43",6,179
"7 a.m. — Breakfast at home. 2 p.m. — I do an internship on weekends at a photo studio. It's unpaid but they buy me lunch — a Starbucks sandwich and iced tea ($8). $0 5 p.m. — I go grocery shopping to restock. I look through my recipes before going to the store, pick out what sounds good, and make a list of what I need to buy. At Key Foods, I grab blueberries (on sale 2/$5!), two avocados, a cucumber, onion, half a dozen eggs, greek yogurt, chicken breasts, ground beef, salsa, and chips. $50. I also picked up my laundry ($10). $60 Total: $60",7,179
"9 a.m. — Juice and toast at home before heading out for the day. 9:15 a.m. — To gear up for shopping with the toddler, we grabbed some coffee on the way to the grocery store. $2.15 9:30 a.m. — The whole family went grocery shopping, and we picked up items for the week, so staples like bread and milk, as well as specific items for meals (chicken breast, cilantro, etc.). We hit Walmart because we can get everything at once, including organic milk and produce. We also had to buy some household items, Ziploc bags that I use to freeze bulk cooking, air freshener, and toddler nutrition shakes. I have a picky eater. $113.76 1 p.m. — Went with some friends to an art exhibition (free!) and then grabbed a curry bowl at Spice 6 for lunch. $10.57 7 p.m. — Spent the rest of the evening at home, prepping for the week. This normally includes making a few meals in advance, but was feeling lazy so pushed that to Monday. Dinner was leftovers. Total amount spent: $126.48",1,180
"7 a.m. — I have an alternate work schedule, so I work from 7:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. This allows me to do day-care pickup (my husband drops off the toddler in the morning) and not have a rushed evening. In the morning I take the metro to work, and I use the flexible-spending account where a portion of my check is taken out pre-tax and put on a debit card to cover transit costs. This changes month to month, but I put $113.40 in this month. For the ride, $2.55. 7:30 a.m. — I usually make breakfast at work by keeping quick oats, walnut pieces, and dried fruit at my desk. We have free coffee that isn’t half bad, which helps keep away the Starbucks habit. 12 p.m. — I brought in leftovers from Spice 6 and mixed them with some leftover noodles. Voilà — fusion cooking! 2 p.m. — My office mates bring in lots of food; today we had cupcakes from someone’s kid’s birthday party and a veggie tray. 4 p.m. — I pick up my son on my way back, so my Metro fare is slightly more as I go to the day care, which is where my husband leaves the car for me to drive back home (he also covers the car insurance). However... 4:45 p.m. — MASSIVE delays on the Metro! I waited at one station for 30 minutes with nary a train in sight. I gave up and, fearing the $10-a-minute charge if I am late with day-care pickup, I grabbed a Lyft. Unfortunately my Metro card had already been charged, so that was a wash, but at least it wasn’t my full fare. $2.55 5:20 p.m. — My Lyft driver got me to day care with time to spare. I picked up my son, and then the car from the nearby garage, where my husband leaves it every morning. Since we pay a monthly fee for the garage, I simply used the fob from the garage company and exited without paying. $15.94 7 p.m. — I made rice and lentils from our groceries. Husband was working late, so I comforted my toddler missing his daddy by allowing him to have frozen waffles for dinner. Total amount spent: $21.04",2,180
"7 a.m. — Trains working again. $2.55 7:35 a.m. — Coworker felt like taking a walk to Starbucks, and I ended up getting a Blonde Roast. $1.84 7:50 a.m. — Same breakfast of oatmeal, walnuts, and fruit. 11:45 a.m. — Lots of conference calls today, so I felt like I was going from meeting to meeting. Thankfully, there was a large fruit tray left over from a morning meeting so I could scarf down some berries and pineapple between meetings. 12:50 p.m. — Forgot to pack anything, so I grabbed a soup from the local deli. I augmented it with some fruit from home and some popcorn that I keep at my desk. $4.97 4:15 p.m. — Metro to day care. $2.85 5:20 p.m. — Picked up the toddler at day care, but had to kill time before a meeting at his school. We grabbed a kid's meal at Baja Fresh to keep him happy until we get home. I ate half of it. $4.93 7:30 p.m. — Husband was working late and the toddler was fed, so I fixed myself some lentils and rice for dinner. I did the bedtime routine before settling in for some TV time. Total amount spent: $17.14",3,180
"7:20 a.m. — Seriously, the D.C. Metro is a nightmare! They decided to shut down the ENTIRE train system for 29 hours for safety inspections. Thankfully my husband was able to secure a free parking pass at his office, so we did a day-care drop-off and then drove in together and parked at his office, which is walking distance from my office. My manager was very understanding of my one-hour-late arrival, since he was late too! 8:25 a.m. — I was starving at this point; I usually eat much earlier. I made coffee, my usual oatmeal, and settled in for the day. A lot of people were telecommuting, so the office was nice and quiet. 10:30 a.m. — The quiet was making me hungry. I ate a banana I brought from home and made myself some office tea. 1 p.m. — After a call that went too long, I sadly realized I had left my packed lunch at home in my fridge. Two days in a row is not good for the budget. I lifted my spirits by hitting the food trucks and getting a large and tasty gyro salad. Bonus — thanks to some free fruit and dessert in the conference room, I only ate half and could have the other half tomorrow! $9 4 p.m. — Picked up the car and headed to day care. I don’t normally drive out of D.C., so the traffic was a ""fun"" experience. I safely got myself to day care, and grabbed the toddler. The school provided a drive-home snack of an apple today, which he enjoyed. 7 p.m. — More lentils and rice! My husband was finally home in time for dinner, woo-hoo. We also made some guac, as we had a few avocados that would have gone bad otherwise. The toddler threw his rice and lentils across the room (deep breath), and decided he wanted Cheerios and blueberries instead. Total amount spent: $9",4,180
"7 a.m. — Metro was running again, and without major issues, for now. $2.55 7:45 a.m. — I made some office coffee and ate a banana. Not feeling oatmeal this morning, so I grabbed a cheese stick instead, which I keep in the office fridge. 9:35 a.m. — Our friends are having a birthday party for their 1-year-old on Saturday and have very generously asked for donations to be made to help the Syrian refugee crisis, as opposed to traditional gifts. They set up a link through Evite to their charity of choice, which I used to make the donation. $50 9:45 a.m. — Breakfast in the conference room! I love food from breakfast meetings, especially when I don't have to go to the meeting. I made myself a granola, vanilla yogurt, and blueberry parfait. 12:17 p.m. — I got lunch with a friend who works nearby. I brought my leftover salad and she brought food from home. We grabbed a nice spot outside and enjoyed the weather. 1:15 p.m. — I had a conference for the rest of the day. I grabbed a Lyft to the hotel. Since it was work-related, I could comp it. 6:30 p.m. — My office sponsored a table at a charity dinner tonight. I attended and got to enjoy a nice steak dinner while catching up with a lot of people I’ve worked with over the years. It’s totally true when people say D.C. is a small town. 8:45 p.m. — Since the dinner was work-related, I grabbed a Lyft home and comped it. Total amount spent: $52.55",5,180
"7 a.m. — Back to regular life and my morning Metro ride after a night of fancy food and free drinks. $2.55 7:40 a.m. — Oatmeal with fruit and nuts. Plus coffee. 12:20 p.m. — Grabbed some Potbelly’s for lunch, specifically a chicken-salad sandwich on multigrain bread with veggies and hot peppers. And some SunChips. $6.92 2:15 p.m. — Made a “mocha” with office coffee machine and some hot chocolate. 4:10 p.m. — Metro to day care, grabbed toddler, and drove home. $2.85 7 p.m. — Husband made chicken stew and panfried veggies for dinner last night, so we finished those leftovers for dinner. Toddler would only eat three graham crackers (sigh), and then downed a nutrition shake before bedtime. Total amount spent: $12.32",6,180
"7:15 a.m. — I really wanted to sleep in, but toddler had other ideas and woke us up to a rousing rendition of ""Itsy Bitsy Spider."" Made myself a fried egg, toast, and tea. I also had some leftover roasted veggies and a bowl of blackberries and blueberries. Toddler had oatmeal made with quick oats, fortified baby cereal, whole milk, and frozen berries. The berries get very soft and mix in nicely when cooked with the oatmeal. 1:45 p.m. — We had two 1-year-old birthday parties today. We drove to CVS, and I grabbed two kids' cards. One card got the donation slip from earlier in the week; the other got a gift card my husband bought. Teamwork. $8.44 2 p.m. — We drove to the first birthday party. It was safari-themed and we scarfed down some wings, turkey rolls, egg-salad sandwiches, bruschetta, spinach-artichoke dip, and “jungle” punch. Also, some pretty hard-to-deny chocolate cake with green frosting. 7 p.m. — Birthday two was a more formal affair. It was a catered event in a hotel, with a buffet of traditional Bengali food (the family’s heritage). Yum. And at the end, there were some fantastic chai-tea lattes for everyone to take in to-go cups. Total amount spent: $8.44",7,180
"7:30 a.m. — Breakfast. Cereal and coffee at home. 9 a.m. — Grande Blonde Roast from Starbucks, because the cup I had at my apartment was not enough for me to remain alive during my 10 a.m. meeting. It's $2.45, but I still have $38 on a gift card from Christmas. 12:30 a.m. — Lunch, brought from home. I spend about $50 every week on groceries, and I have been bringing lunch since October to save money for a vacation I’m taking in 2017. It's my fourth day of zucchini noodles, yogurt, and an apple from home. Dinner — The boy is making dinner for me tonight, so I pick up two different wine options. A Riesling and a Malbec. I’m running late from work, of course, so I just pick out whatever looks good. $45.71 Total: $45.71",1,181
"9 a.m. — I’m running a bit behind, so no time to stop for a bagel and coffee, which is what I was craving. I make an alternative at home — toast with some smoked salmon. My cup of coffee goes in a travel mug. 9:30 a.m. — Crosstown and Fifth Ave. bus to MOMA, since my friend and I have decided we are overdue for a cultural day out. 10 a.m. — We meet up at the MOMA. I wish I kept some business cards from my prior company so that I could get the reduced admission. Instead, I pay full price. $25 Lunch — After MOMA, we go to a wine bar in Hell’s Kitchen: Three glasses of wine and the orecchiette. $61.72 7 p.m. — Tonight is my friend’s 30th birthday celebration. I realize I’m going to be late, so I get in an Uber, which ends up taking longer than just taking the subway. $27.98 8 p.m. — Drinks and food at the birthday dinner. $68 11 p.m. — I’m offered a shot at the next bar. This can lead to nothing good. The boy gets the cab home. Total: $182.70",2,181
"9 a.m. — Such a mistake staying out so late on Saturday. I'm going to Hunter Mountain today and wake up later than expected. I realize that I am going to have to take a cab to the other side of town to make the bus. Food is limited to coffee in a to-go mug and toast, which is all I can enjoy in my state of a hangover. $14.52 10 a.m. — We make it to the bus (bus ticket, rentals, etc., were purchased last month). Lunch — My friends and I decided to try the chili, which was talked up by the tour leader. It’s not that great. Throw in a water and a soda. $14.95 5 p.m. — I grab a bottle of water for the ride home (which I forget to drink) and a free hot beverage at the end of the day. $2.45 8 p.m. — We arrive back on the west side of the city, and I am tired and it's rainy. I miraculously find a cab. $17.80 Dinner — Leftover chicken from three nights ago and an Aleve as preventative care for my calves tomorrow. Total: $49.72",3,181
"Breakfast — Cereal and coffee at home. 9 a.m. — Another coffee at Starbucks. $2.45 off the gift card. Lunch — I bring leftover chicken, carrots, and yogurt from home. Need to remember to pick up yogurt at Fairway tonight, along with everything else for a salad recipe I found in an old cookbook. 4 p.m. — Banana from the communal fruit bowl at work. I’ve decided to fight the residual pain from skiing yesterday and go to a spin class later on. I’ll take a dose of potassium to fight off an inevitable leg cramp. 7 p.m. — Spin class at Equinox. I fill up my water bottle right before class, where my ass is kicked. 8:30 p.m. — I pick up ingredients for lunch prep for the remainder of the week. This week, I’m trying a salad from one of my cookbooks; but I'm also limiting what I purchase, because I’m traveling to my parents' house to surprise my mom for her birthday. Plus, I have another trip to Iceland the Wednesday after. I pick up sourdough bread and eggs in addition to salad ingredients. I forget yogurt and vow to pick it up later. $31.09 Dinner — Leftover eggplant parm and a glass of wine, both from day one. 8 p.m. — In serious need of laundry to be done. I pull out a $20 to add to my laundry card and am able to get through five loads in 90 minutes. Meanwhile, I start meal prep for the remainder of the week. $20 Total: $51.09",4,181
"Breakfast — The avocados in my fridge are still hard as a rock. I prep eggs with mushrooms, cheese, just a little onion, and sourdough toast. The veggies and cheese are from a couple weeks ago, but they still look okay to eat. At day five, I think it should go without saying — one cup of coffee at home. 8:30 a.m. — I’m running late to work (20 minutes on the platform waiting for the C train), so no way to stop for another coffee today. I’ll try to live. Lunch — I eat carrots and my salad creation that I was up until 11 p.m. preparing last night. I also shop for a remote release shutter for my DSLR. I need it by the time I leave for Iceland next week, so I choose expedited shipping (not Prime eligible, unfortunately), but it's only $6 more than renting, so I make the investment. $41.58 7 p.m. — Hot yoga class tonight. Dinner — One lonely piece of chicken left and the remaining carrots I didn’t eat at lunch today. Total: $41.58",5,181
"Breakfast — Same as yesterday. Those damn avocados won’t be ripe until I’m on vacation, I bet. Coffee, obviously. 9 a.m. — I’m not sure if it was waiting for the bus for 15 minutes today or that I am just that tired, but a splurge for a venti Blonde Roast. $2.78 at Starbucks on the gift card. Lunch — A meal prepped from Monday. I forgot my carrots and realize I never purchased that yogurt. Again. At this point, I’ll just go without for the rest of the week. Dinner — Today was forecasted to be damp and cold, so I am in the mood for comfort food. There are meatballs I handmade from a few weeks ago in the freezer, which I defrosted during the day, so I make some spaghetti. Kitchen is a disaster as a result of all the pots and pans for this feast, but the meal is so good. I also open the Riesling I purchased on day one. Total: $0",6,181
"Breakfast — I sleep in (oops)! I have a bowl of cereal and a cup of coffee. Another grande coffee at Starbucks, since one cup was not enough for today. $2.45 off the gift card. Lunch — I barely had time to throw the remnants of my salad into a container this morning, but proud that I did it! Dinner — Tonight is an event with a vendor to celebrate the filing of our annual report. My coworkers and I walk to the event, since it feels like spring outside. Food and drinks are covered, and so is the cab for the ride home. Total: $0",7,181
"9 a.m. — We get free breakfast at work on Mondays, so I help myself and then buy a coffee. $3.05 1 p.m. — I refuse to buy lunch at work on any day that isn’t a Friday, so I usually grocery shop on the weekend and get stuff to make salad with during the week. I didn’t have time to go to the supermarket yesterday, but miraculously, my leftover ingredients from last week haven’t gone off. I assemble a salad from those ingredients, plus some kale from a coworker. 3 p.m. — Time for another coffee. $3.05 4:45 p.m. — I leave work early to meet some label reps over drinks at a nearby bar; they pick up the bill. 6:00 p.m. — I walk home and go an extra 20 minutes out of my way to go past a supermarket that’s cheaper than any of the ones near my house. I’ve already got cheese and jalapeños in the fridge, so I buy a chicken breast, beans, spice mix, and fresh veggies to make Mexi-bowls with, plus some bread and jam. $22.10 7:00 p.m. — I cook dinner, watch and do some freelance work. Total: $28.20",1,182
"8:40 a.m. — I put credit on my pre-paid train pass, which is enough to get me to work all week. $15.24 . 9:00 a.m. — I keep a big packet of quick oats on my desk to make breakfast with every morning; there’s free milk and honey in the office kitchen. I go grab a coffee. $3.05 1:00 p.m. — Leftovers are still going strong, so I make another salad. 1:30 p.m. — I walk to the chemist (I think this is called a drugstore in the U.S.?) on my lunch break to buy shampoo because it’s on special, but I come back with face wash, mascara, and deodorant, too. Oops. $29.72  2:00 p.m. — It’s cold, and I’m grumpy, so I buy a hot cross bun and a coffee to cheer up. $6.10 4:30 p.m. — One of the girls at my work finds a Groupon that gives you a one month F45 pass for 19 AUD, which is incredible given they usually charge 65 AUD ($49.53) a week. We all buy one. I also figure this might help me get back into an exercise routine, because as you may have noticed I haven’t been using that gym membership. $14.48  6:15 p.m. — I leave work. I’ve got into the habit of purging my wardrobe every few months and putting the discards for sale on eBay (Kondo method — it works), so I invited a friend over to be my clothes model for the night in exchange for dinner and wine. But it’s raining, and we needed to take the photos outside, so we have to postpone. 7:00 p.m. — I make another Mexi-bowl for dinner. Whenever I cook, I buy enough to make two serves, because it’s cheaper that way. Total: $68.59",2,182
"9:00 a.m. — Oats at my desk for breakfast again, and a colleague shouts me a coffee. 12:30 p.m. — Me and my boyfriend of 18 months split up last week, and I guess one of my colleagues heard about it, because he brings me some consolatory jalapeño poppers. I guess that’s what they call a silver lining? 1:00 p.m. — I’m still hungry, so I go to the supermarket and buy a yogurt. I also get a curry to eat for dinner tonight; it’s on special because it’s about expire. But literally two minutes later my friend texts me to see if we can reschedule our dinner date from tomorrow to today. The curry goes in the bin. $4.53 2:30 p.m. — Coffee. I can’t function without two a day. $3.05 7:30 p.m. — I stay back at work late to finish off some freelance work; then I meet my friend for dinner at our favorite cheap and cheerful Chinese place. The food is $11.43 each, but I pick up more of the bill more because she brought the wine. $15.24  9:30 p.m. — I try to get an Uber home, but the driver cancels on me (ugh). I get the train instead, even though I don’t like walking home from the station at night because my neighborhood’s a bit sketchy. Total: $22.82",3,182
"9:30 a.m. — Running late for work and definitely feeling that wine. I get a coffee on the way in and eat oats at my desk. $3.05  1:00 p.m. — Tomorrow’s a public holiday, which means this is a fake Friday. Thank you, Easter. I and the work crew go to a Mexican place up the road (I swear this is not the only cuisine I eat) for lunch. $10.29  2:00 p.m. — I get a coffee on the way back to the office. $3.05 5:30 p.m. — Train home from work. I was meant to see my ex tonight, but I’m tired and a bit hungover, so I cancel, get Thai takeaway, and watch reruns instead. The Thai place is cash only, so I get money out at an ATM, which means paying a $1.52 fee. $7.62  Total: $24.01",4,182
"10:30 a.m. — It’s a public holiday, and you know I’m sleeping in. My friends and I are going to a small coastal town an hour out of the city for the weekend to visit a friend who’s house-sitting, which means accommodation is free. 12:30 p.m. — The bad news is that major supermarkets and all bottle shops legally have to close on Good Friday in Australia — and we have nothing to eat or drink tonight. I bring a bottle of gin from home, and eventually we find a small food shop that’s open. So I grab some olives, salami, and crackers to bring — and I get a coffee. $14.48  4:00 p.m. — We drive to the beach house. Our host makes us sandwiches for a late lunch, and eventually we all head to the beach. Parking is $6.10, but we figure there won’t be any inspectors around today, so we don’t buy tickets. 7:00 p.m. — Turns out restaurants on the coast are still open, so we get fish and chips for dinner. I shout the friend who drove me here in lieu of chipping in for petrol. $22.10  9:00 p.m. — We go back to the house, drink all of the alcohol we could find in our respective homes, play Kings, and talk shit until 2:00 a.m. Total: $36.58",5,182
"12:00 p.m. — My friends and I drive to a nearby town for a recovery breakfast. I get a juice, coffee, and some eggs — and, as with everything in regional Australia, it’s overpriced and underwhelming. $23.62  1:30 p.m. — We head back to the beach and decide to pay for parking this time. I go halves with my friend. $3.05  5:30 p.m. — I could keep sleeping on the sand for another couple of hours, but my friends are over it, so we decide to head back. One carload goes to the supermarket to get cheese, dip, pickles, crackers, and more olives for “dinner."" I chip in some cash. $7.62 7:30 p.m. — We all have naps and then play Scattergories, talk more shit, and fall asleep watching a movie. Wholesome, right? Total: $34.29",6,182
"11:00 a.m. — My friends are all staying another night, but I have life admin to do, so I get the train back to Sydney. I still have credit on my train pass, so the trip is free. 1:00 p.m. — I indulge in my weekend ritual: reading the paper over brunch at my favorite cafe. I end up paying $3.81 for the paper so I can hit the Eftpos minimum (which is a total scam, and I hate it). The food and coffee is $16. $19.81 7:00 p.m. — I don’t feel like cooking, so I get sushi for dinner ($12.95) and buy a beer ($3.43). And a packet of my favorite biscuits ($3.81). Yolo. $20.19 Total: $40",7,182
"8:00 a.m. — It's been a busy week, I'm tired AND it's snowing and 30 degrees in April, so I stop and buy a coffee on my way to work to cheer myself up and get energized. I normally make coffee at home during the week, so this is kind of a special treat. I made a smoothie at home with frozen fruit, juice, and protein powder for breakfast at work. $2.25 10:00 a.m. — My smoothie didn't keep me full as long as I expected. I eat the hard-boiled egg I brought to work but was saving for the afternoon. 12:00 p.m. — I usually bring lunch to work every day, but it's the end of the week and we have no leftovers at home, so I head to a bagel shop for a veggie bagel sandwich. I bring it back to work and eat at my desk. $6.14 5:00 p.m. — My husband got home from work early so he had time to walk the dog and feed him. We decide to go to happy hour at a nearby (and expensive) beer bar. We both have two beers. Total comes to $33.58, and my husband picks up the check. 6:30 p.m. — After happy hour, we're starving so we get tacos. If you order three tacos, you get free rice and beans. He has a beer and I have a $5 margarita (house specialty!). I pay. $41.62 8:00 p.m. — Our goal was to go grocery shopping tonight, and we finish dinner in time to head to the natural foods store to stock up for the week before it closes. We alternate who pays for groceries and today is my turn. We buy greens (leaf lettuce, spinach, sprouts), vegetables (sweet potatoes, peppers, broccoli, celery, etc.), lots of fruit (apples, bananas, oranges) and dairy products (milk, butter, eggs, yogurt). They're having a really good sale on organic canned beans (10 for $10) so we stock up on those as well as dish soap (2 for $5). My husband snuck a six-pack into the cart and I didn't notice until we got to the checkout. This bill is a bit higher than normal but it'll save money on our shopping trips for the next few weeks so I don't mind. $114.24 Total: $164.25",1,183
"7:30 a.m. — I get up earlier than expected for a Saturday and make some coffee. I'm not hungry yet so I just have coffee and water. 9:00 a.m. — There are a few things we go to the conventional grocery store for. Plus my 5-year-old nephew is sleeping over at our house tonight so we get some snacks for him. We buy string cheese, peanuts, crackers, juice, and some other random stuff. $36.77 9:45 a.m. — We stop at the pharmacy to pick up my birth control prescription. It's covered entirely by insurance but I remembered that I need a new Burt's Bees lip balm. $3.47 10:00 a.m. — I am starving by the time we get home. I toast half of a whole wheat bagel, add peanut butter, and drink a bunch of water. 12:00 p.m. — Last week we had planned to make vegetable soup for lunch today so we make that and finish eating just in time for my sister-in-law to drop off my nephew. 1:30 p.m. — My nephew is already hungry so we both have a piece of string cheese and split an apple. 5:30 p.m. — Dinner is individual pita pizzas, apple slices, and milk. All made from ingredients we bought last night. 7:00 p.m. — We watch a movie and eat homemade popcorn made in the air popper. Total: $40.24",2,183
"6:00 a.m. — I wake up to my nephew telling me that he's hungry. I make a bowl of cereal for him but am not hungry yet, so I brew some coffee. 8:00 a.m. — I toast half of a bagel and add peanut butter. 9:30 a.m. — As promised, my nephew and I walk to a nearby coffee shop to get a hot chocolate for him. We also get a giant cinnamon roll to split and I decide to get a chai tea. $9.54 11:30 a.m. — For lunch for the three of us, I make a box of Annie's macaroni and cheese and slice up some apples. I'm getting really sick of eating apples. 3:00 p.m. — My brother came to pick up my nephew so my husband and I can resume normal life. We head to a brewery for a beer and a snack. We each get a beer and split an order of loaded tater tots. He pays the $18.38 tab. 4:30 p.m. — We don't feel like going home yet so we go to another brewery. We each get one beer and split a third. I pay. $22.00 6:30 p.m. — I'm kind of hungry again but not enough for a whole dinner. We had planned to make spaghetti but decide not to. I snack on cheese and crackers instead. Having my nephew this weekend really messed up my eating schedule. Total: $31.54",3,183
"8:00 a.m. — I'm tempted to go buy a cup of coffee this morning but I stay strong and make it at home instead. For breakfast, I drink a protein smoothie that I brought from home. 9:45 p.m. — Mid-morning snack is some almonds from my desk drawer. 10:30 a.m. — The almonds didn't cut it and I'm hungry again. I eat a string cheese I brought from home. 12:00 p.m. — Lunch is leftover vegetable soup from day three and water. 12:45 p.m. — It's kinda nice out today so I walk to a nearby deli with a coworker and buy an (unhealthy) desk snack: chocolate covered peanuts. I eat a few when I get back to my desk, of course. $4.04 3:00 p.m. — Afternoon snack of a Noosa blood orange yogurt that I brought from home. This project is making me realize that I snack a lot. On dairy products. I'm a true Wisconsinite! 5:15 p.m. — I'm kind of hungry when I get home, so I eat some cheese and crackers. I'm hoping this will satisfy me until I get home from the gym later. 8:00 p.m. — It's later than I expected when I get home from the gym, but I'm pretty hungry so I make a pita pizza with leftover ingredients from day two. Total: $4.04",4,183
"8:00 a.m. — I had coffee at home this morning and a smoothie at work that I brought from home. 11:00 a.m. — I snack on a piece of string cheese I brought from home. 12:00 p.m. — Last night while my pizza baked, I prepped my lunch for today. I made a really weird sandwich but it's mysteriously delicious: roasted sweet potato slices, goat cheese with sun-dried tomatoes, a drizzle of honey, and greens on whole wheat bread. I also eat some chocolate-covered peanuts from my desk drawer (I should not have bought those...). 2:30 p.m. — Carrot sticks for an afternoon snack. I feel so responsible! 5:30 p.m. — My husband leaves to meet up with some friends for drinks but I don't want to go so I stay home, make a scrambled egg sandwich on a bagel with cheese, and then walk the dog. 8:00 p.m. — After prepping my lunch for tomorrow, I'm hungry so I eat a piece of string cheese (god I eat a lot of cheese). Total: $0",5,183
"7:30 a.m. — I drink coffee at home. I fill up my gas tank on the way to work. $30.44 8:00 a.m. — Breakfast at work is a chia pudding thing with oatmeal, cinnamon, and cocoa. I've never made it before and it's okay. Chia seeds have the weirdest texture. Full disclosure: The recipe is from Gwyneth Paltrow's new book that I found online. 11:00 a.m. — After two hours of meetings, I'm starving when I get back to my desk. I eat a handful of almonds and chug some water. 12:00 p.m. — I made that weird (but delicious) sandwich again. Water and a pear to go with it, all brought from home. 2:30 p.m. — Carrot sticks again for an afternoon snack. 5:30 p.m. — When I get home from work, my husband is already cooking veggie stir-fry for dinner, so we're ready to eat early enough to walk the dog AND go to the gym later. 8:30 p.m. — After the gym I'm pretty hungry, so I eat some graham crackers we had in the pantry. Total: $30.44",6,183
"8:00 a.m. — Coffee at home and a smoothie with protein powder at work. 10:30 a.m. — I didn't bring a morning snack and I'm out of almonds in my desk drawer. I stop by the cafeteria at work and buy some Ritz crackers. $1.47 1:15 p.m. — The crackers surprisingly kept me full until now. I finally go get my lunch of leftover veggie stir-fry from last night and drink water. 5:30 p.m. — After work, my husband surprises me with some concert tickets for a band we both really like, Caroline Smith with Lorde Freddee. I don't really like going to shows during the workweek, but we have a pretty low-key weekend planned and he got the tickets for free from a coworker. We decide to make a little date night out of it and head to a bar to catch the end of happy hour and get some cheap apps (tater tots, a mini pizza, and spinach artichoke dip...super unhealthy!). The bills is $33.28 and he treats. 7:30 p.m. — I buy us both two beers each at the show. $26 Total: $27.47",7,183
"8:00 a.m. — My direct deposit hits overnight, and I let myself feel rich for 60 seconds before immediately paying all my bills. My pay is monthly because my CEO somehow thinks this will help us budget better, but it just leaves me feeling very poor in the last eight days of each month. 8:30 a.m. — I mobile-order Starbucks for me and my boyfriend. I’ve paid for his coffee every single morning for nearly a year, out of habit, and am trying to rethink how to break this a.m. tradition without it being awkward. $9 8:45 a.m. — Boyfriend gives me a ride to work in my car. We both use it to commute, dropping off and picking one another up depending on the day. Our schedules are complicated, but we make it work. It’s my turn to fill the tank. At least gas prices are still relatively low. $20 9:30 a.m. —There are free bagels at the office and I try very hard to resist, but there’s one pumpernickel left and it’s SCREAMING my name. Noon — We get some healthy snacks delivered to the office (start-up perks), so I run out to the grocery store next door to supplement and hopefully create a meal. I pick up an avocado and some greens from the salad bar, then add frozen strawberries and bananas from the office freezer to make a lunch smoothie. $3 3:00 p.m. — Eat the other half of my avocado on a piece of office toast. Trendy. 6:00 p.m. — I attempt a total-body conditioning class at my gym. It’s included in my membership that’s too expensive, but which I justify by calling it a “health tax.” 7:30 p.m. — On the way home, I stop by the drugstore. I am an insane person about using coupons, and I spend far too much time calculating Extra Bucks. It pays off, though: I end up saving somewhere in the $40 range for months’ worth of facial care, body lotion, toothpaste, and tampons. $33 8:00 p.m. — I take the express bus home, even though it costs twice as much as regular transport. $5 8:45 p.m. — A new neighborhood Thai spot has opened and is offering 15% off. My boyfriend and I decide to give it a try. He pays. Daily Total : $70",1,184
"9:00 a.m. — Get a ride into work. We're running late, so no time for coffee. My wallet thanks me. 10:30 a.m. — We get a Nutribullet in the office, so my co-workers and I try making Bulletproof coffee (hot coffee blended with coconut oil and ghee). It's amazing, and I feel ENERGIZED. 12:30 p.m. — A coworker won an industrial-sized canister of peanut butter pretzels, so this is my lunch. 4:00 p.m. — Grab another avocado and greens from the grocery store for a pre-workout smoothie. $3 6:30 p.m. — Gym. On the way out of the gym, there's a protein-bar rep handing out free samples. Score. 9:00 p.m. — I stockpile Amy's Green Curry frozen meals for nights when I'm too lazy to make, pick up, or even order food. This curry is honestly some of the best I've had, frozen or otherwise. Daily Total : $3",2,184
7:00 a.m. — Wake up feeling extremely sick. Slack my coworkers that I'll be out of the office. 1:00 p.m. — Wake up again and feel only slightly better. 6:00 p.m. — Take the dog for a walk and pick up a can of soup at the bodega. $3 9:00 p.m. — Netflix until I fall asleep. Today was a wash. Daily Total : $3,3,184
"7:00 a.m. — My boss is speaking at a women’s networking event, and I’m here to live-tweet the whole thing. I am miserable to be ""networking"" so early in the morning, and I still don't feel 100%, but at least breakfast is free. 1:00 p.m. — I see an acre of land on Mars for sale on Groupon and think this will be funny to gift to my boyfriend. Maybe we can also move there if this election continues the way it is. $10 1:30 p.m. — Comparing vegan sandwiches at Pret. $8 6:00 p.m. — Pick up dog food, but forget human food. $20 7:00 p.m. — I refuse to wash my hair at our disgusting apartment, but I can't really complain since they don't ask for rent. The shower is straight out of a horror film, though, so I spend as little time in it as possible. Twice a week, I go to my mother’s house outside the city to have a nice, long shower and give myself a blow-out. Sometimes we have dinner, and tonight is one of those evenings. I bring leftovers back for my boyfriend because I know he wouldn’t feed himself otherwise. Daily Total : $38",4,184
"9:00 a.m. — Starbucks mobile order. They make this shit too easy. $9 12:45 p.m. — I have a monster cystic acne pimple right between my eyes that has been lingering for a week. I cannot take one more second of it; I go to my derm for a cortisone shot and immediate relief. It’s expensive, but worth it. $40 1:30 p.m. — Thinking of ways to make my bedroom feel more cheery and end up purchasing several succulents from Home Depot. $30 2:30 p.m. — I have a sneaking suspicion something is up with my dog, so I take her to the vet. I’m right: She has hookworm. I’m glad we’ve found out what’s going on, but horrified at the “sick visit” and testing fee. $200 4:00 p.m. — Realize I haven’t eaten anything all day and pick up a bodega egg sandwich. $3 6:00 p.m. — Scoop my boyfriend from work and it’s still light out! We get to take our pup on a long walk together, which is rare, and then grab dinner, my treat. $25 9:00 p.m. — Friends are in town, so I know spending money will be inevitable tonight. We end up going to a bar with a cover, and I buy a round of drinks. It’s fun until we run into drama (in the form of my friend's ex-girlfriend) at the end of the night, which makes me regret having gone out in the first place. $50 Daily Total : $357",5,184
"9:00 a.m. — It’s the weekend, but my boyfriend has work, so I’m up early to give him a ride. Our Starbucks barista hands us our mobile order when we walk in the door. $9 3:00 p.m. — I’m feeling depressed and have been in bed all day. I decide to take the dog for a walk someplace away from our neighborhood in an attempt to feel productive, and I treat myself to my favorite vegan meal because we’re in the area. I feel 5% better. $16 8:00 p.m. — Tonight we’re celebrating my birthday with friends: pizza, pina coladas, and many, many beers. My boyfriend hasn’t gotten paid in two weeks (an HR mistake at his company) so I pay for the two of us. I can tell he feels guilty. $100 Daily Total : $125",6,184
"12 p.m. —Happy to sleep in late, but sad to wake up another year older. Good morning, 27. The only upside is my free Starbucks drink. 2 p.m. — Our favorite weekend activity is thrifting. We go to Goodwill, and I find a vintage Syracuse Orangeman sweatshirt. Great for March Madness, even though I don’t really even enjoy sports. $5 4 p.m. — Hit up PetSmart for doggy accessories and treats. (We spoil our dog.) $26 7 p.m. — My mom takes me out for dinner for my birthday at my favorite restaurant, and we get nearly one of everything on the menu. It’s an amazing meal, and super generous of her. She also includes $100 in the birthday card — what a saint. Daily Total: $31",7,184
"9:30 a.m. — I wake up late today, because I was out for a friend’s birthday the night before. I have a bowl of cereal for breakfast. 10:00 a.m. — I make some coffee and then park myself on the couch with my laptop to start work for the day. 2:00 p.m. — I heat up some leftover pasta that I made two evenings ago for lunch. The pasta fills me up, but it’s mediocre at best, as I’m out of Parmesan cheese. 6:30 p.m. — I meet two of my friends at a Japanese restaurant in Koreatown for dinner. We chose the location based on a special errand we had to run later that evening. $38 7:45 p.m. — Time to run the ""special errand."" One of the two friends is celebrating her birthday this weekend and she thought it would be a fun occasion to try molly. So, earlier in the week, I reached out to a “friend” (read: acquaintance) I met at a party about where I can buy some. He gives me the number of another friend who is not a dealer, but “just doing me a favor.” The guy is spinning at an underground bar in Koreatown tonight, so we get there early and sit down for a drink (so we don't look conspicuous). Eventually, the exchange happens. He invites us to hang out, but it's too awkward and I can't handle another weeknight out. We sneak out shortly after his set starts. Beers, $7; molly, $30 (I buy two 0.1 to 0.15-g pills at $15 each. My friend buys three.) $37 Daily Total: $75",1,185
"8:30 a.m. — Breakfast consists of some granola and Greek yogurt. 1:00 p.m. — I don’t feel like making my own lunch today, so I get Williamsburg Pizza for lunch. My eyes were bigger than my stomach, so I only eat one slice. $7 6:00 p.m. — I eat the second slice of pizza to hold me over until a friend’s housewarming. 7:30 p.m. — I stop at the corner wine shop for a housewarming present. I want to get some bubbly, as that seems appropriate for such an event. I ponder over a bottle with fancy packaging and name; the wine shop clerk comes over to tell me about the Beaujolais I have in my hand. A sparkling red that’s been gaining popularity...what do I know? But I buy it, because it sounds fancy enough and I’ve never tried a sparkling red. $16 8:00 p.m. — I’m told that they need more cups. I stop by a Walgreens to pick some up. Luckily, I don't have to worry about dinner, because they were providing lots of snacks. $7 Daily Total: $30",2,185
"10:00 a.m. — It’s the weekend and I sleep in. I make some eggs and bacon for brunch. 2:00 p.m. — My friend and her fiancé are celebrating a joint birthday today, and we’re starting early. After a couple of pitchers and some birthday shots for the couple, I close out my tab. $63 Around 7:00 p.m. — We take the pills. 8:00 p.m. — We end up hitting up a few more bars in an attempt to find music and lights. As the molly kicks in, the desire to drink minimizes. We don’t really end up eating a real meal for dinner. I try to eat some fries, but they taste like mushy sand. $24 1:30 a.m. — The molly was good while it lasted, but not too strong; so, it's starting to wear off. I decide I can't handle the subway while still semi-rolling, so I take a taxi home. $20 Daily Total: $107",3,185
"11:00 a.m. — I’m not horribly hungover today, but I just feel exhausted. I’m basically a waste of space for the entire day, moving only between the bed and the couch. I snack a little here and there, but still don’t feel like I have an appetite. 6:00 p.m. — Around dinner time, my appetite seems to have returned, so I order sushi on Seamless. $22 Daily Total: $22",4,185
"8:00 a.m. — I skip breakfast, because I need to get work done this morning before meeting up with an old roommate later this afternoon. 1:00 p.m. — I make a sandwich from groceries in the fridge. 3:00 p.m. — My dog is almost out of food, so I place an order on Amazon. $23 5:00 p.m. — After catching up with my old roommate outdoors by the water near Chelsea Piers. (It’s practically summer today!) We go for an early dinner. It’s my favorite Italian sandwich takeout place in the city. We enjoy the sandwich while people watching on the High Line. $9 6:30 p.m. — I decide to walk more instead of taking the subway, because the weather is amazing. I stumble upon a gelateria, so of course, I treat myself. $5 Daily Total: $37",5,185
"9:00 a.m. — Breakfast is the usual bowl of cereal, plus coffee, which I make at home. 1:00 p.m. — I scrounge up a salad from my remaining groceries. I’m out of town in a couple of days, so I’ve managed to use most of my perishables at this point. 7:00 p.m. — My friend and I have been trying to get reservations at the newly opened Llama Inn for quite some time now. It just so happens to be today — on a week where I’m definitely over budget. I still go, but the meal is a huge splurge. We get the lomo saltado, which is well worth the price, but we also order two cocktails. I'm going home home to visit my parents for a long weekend, so I justify that I won’t have many expenses while I’m there next week. $80 9:00 p.m. — We meet another friend who lives in the 'Burg for a drink after because my other friend doesn’t get to see her often (she lives in the UES). $6 Daily Total: $86",6,185
"8:45 a.m. — I have a banana for breakfast. 12:00 p.m. — I make my way up to the UWS to meet a client at a café in person. We’ve recruited two new interns to help with our work and I’m meeting them to pass on my projects, since I’m starting a new full-time job in two weeks. The client pays for our lunch and coffee. 1:00 p.m. — I spend the rest of the afternoon at a NYPL (putting our tax dollars to use!). I tend to park it at a library when I’m sick of working from home, rather than a coffee shop, to save a few dollars. 6:00 p.m. — My roommate happened to make extra pasta for dinner and offers me some. I gladly take her up on the offer. 8:00 p.m. — Because I have more work to do this evening, I choose to skip some 4/20 celebration plans I previously made with friends. I didn’t have enough weed lying around and didn’t want to spend money to buy more. My delivery guy only seems to sell eighths at $60 per pop. Eventually, I settle for catching up with my favorite stoner pals Abbi and Ilana (on TV). Daily Total: $0",7,185
"4 a.m. — I've been picking up extra floral work because I didn't have work this week due to spring break, which for normal teachers on salary isn't as big of a deal, but I'm a long-term sub paid a daily rate. I go to the flower market to pick up material for some flower crowns I'm making for a birthday party, to make up for my losses. I have specific vendors I go to, with whom I've developed relationships, so I get some freebie bundles of greens to go with flowers I buy. $115 10 a.m. — Thanks to the day off, I can get my grocery shopping done early. I always shop on Fridays because Safeway has more deals on Fridays. I try to buy essentials that can last through the month as well as dinners for the week. Most of what I buy is on sale or store-brand to save money. I end up buying: bagels, 1 gallon of milk, 1 carton of eggs, a small container of cream cheese, string cheese, cran-mango juice and cran-apple juice (two for $4), 2 cans of frozen lemonade, 1 rotisserie chicken (on sale for $5), 1 bag of potatoes, 3 zucchinis, 4 large carrots (cheaper to cut up than buying baby carrots!), a large pre-washed container of baby arugula, 3 apples, a bundle of bananas, 1 package bacon, 1 tube chorizo, a value pack of chicken breasts (these usually last about a month), a value pack of ground beef (this lasts about 2 weeks), the cheapest (and subsequently the smallest) package of flank steak, corn tortillas, pasta, Safeway brand pasta sauce (garlic and herb is the best-tasting one), a liter of Tapatío (I go through so much, it's cheaper to buy the biggest bottle, which usually lasts about a month), Cheerios, 1 family-size box of Cheez-Its, and ""Tuxedos"" (off-brand Oreos). Total: $135 12 p.m. — I split a bagel with my 1-year-old. We also share some cut-up carrots and Cheez-Its with peanut butter. I drink tap water; he has milk. 4 p.m. — I rip a hole in the thigh of my last pair of leggings. A great reason to go to the mall, where I can get a soft pretzel I've been craving. At the mall I buy: 2 pairs of leggings, 1 pack of socks, 5 pairs of underwear, a small lemonade, a soft pretzel, and a pack of gum (food was $10, including tip). Total: $85 7 p.m. — For dinner I have chorizo, scrambled eggs, and potatoes with avocado slices. I make a big pan full that lasts the two of us a good three days of leftovers. 10 p.m. — I watch on HBO and eat popcorn. I always have a couple bags of kernels that I can air-pop at home, which is much cheaper than microwave and lasts way longer! I also drink some merlot that I have had in my kitchen for awhile. Daily Total : $335",1,186
"7 a.m. — For breakfast I have leftover dinner with a piece of toast and water. Breakfast for dinner is great because leftovers become literal breakfast. 1 p.m. — I've been making flower crowns all morning, so I'm craving a burger. I go to my local greasy spoon and pick up a burger, fries, and iced tea to recharge. $13 5 p.m. — I can't tell if I'm breaking out more this week because of stress, hormones, or the fact that I started taking Biotin (an $8 bottle bought the week before this), but I flee to Rite Aid and grab my favorite spot treatment (Neutrogena Rapid Gel), a macadamia-oil hair mask, and a pack of hair ties. $17 7 p.m. — For dinner, I make lime chicken tacos. I make tacos a lot because they're versatile and cheap. 9 p.m. — I buy a book I needed for school (I work in schools full-time and then also go to school part-time) that I forgot to buy earlier this month. $75 Daily Total: $105",2,186
"6 a.m. — We finish off our chorizo-egg-potato leftovers in mini breakfast burritos. 8 a.m. — I pack my car with flower crowns and extra flowers to head towards the party I'm delivering them to. I have to stop to get gas. I get enough to last through the first few days of work after the weekend ends, too. I hate stopping for gas before work in weekday traffic. $15 10 a.m. — I teach my client how to fix any flower crowns that could break. She gives me a piece of cake, which I pretend to not really want but then scarf down in my car (oops). She also pays me $375 for the flower crowns and delivery. 12 p.m. — Making up for that cake by eating a salad made with ingredients at home. 3 p.m. — I stop at the liquor store and buy a can of Coke after ""Mommy and Me Storytime"" at the library. Cold cokes are my favorite migraine cure. $1 5 p.m. — I eat a granola bar and some cashews at home. 7 p.m. — For dinner, I make some Cuban mojo steak, a recipe from a new cookbook I got. I had to run to the store to pick up oranges, limes, lemons, and black beans. $11 10 p.m. — I impulsively rent Celine Dion's concert movie on-demand and eat off-brand Oreos while I watch it. $5 Daily Total: $32",3,186
"6 a.m. — Spring break is over, which means I'm back to a more steady income via my long-term sub gig. I go to my favorite deli and pick up their morning special: a bagel with butter and a small hot chocolate. $3 10 a.m. — It's my prep period. Unfortunately, now that I don't work in tech* I also don't get my snacks for free. I buy a bag of pretzels from the vending machine. $2 12 p.m. — For lunch, I brought leftover steak sliced up in a salad. I buy an apple juice from the vending machine. $2 4 p.m. — I pick up diapers and St. Ives apricot scrub (my forever ride-or-die holy grail since sixth grade) at Rite Aid. I use my Plenti points, which give me a discount plus $2 off. Since the St. Ives was on sale (buy one, get one half-off), I stock up and buy two. I know in a couple months I'll be glad I did. $19 7 p.m. — For dinner, I cook some ground beef and baby arugula with the store-brand pasta sauce I bought. I cut it with water to make a jar last for two dinners. I top it all with various seasonings and throw in some pasta water from the pasta I'm boiling to thicken it up. 11 p.m. — I eat half a peanut butter and jelly sandwich while making my to-do list for the week. Daily Total: $26",4,186
"7 a.m. — I eat a toast, scrambled egg, and Tapatío sandwich, and iced tea I made at home. 10 a.m. — I eat my lunch (leftover pasta from last night, plus a salad) during my prep period because I'm starving. I know I'll be paying for that when actual lunchtime comes around. 12 p.m. — Yep, paying for it. I buy a bag of pretzels, a bag of Sun Chips, and an apple juice from the vending machines. $6 2 p.m. — The baseball team at the school is selling candy. I have two players in my last class. I buy a bar from each of them. $6 4 p.m. — My white-board markers constantly disappear, so I have to go to Target and buy some more. I technically don't have to buy my own teacher supplies, but I work in a low-funded school district that often doesn't have the best things readily available. I re-up on white-board markers and pens, plus some extra ""incentive"" things, like pencils and sticker sheets, to keep the kids motivated. I also buy a ball (for the baby, not for my students). $38 5 p.m. — I go to my favorite farm stand and pick up 2 avocados, an apple, 6 limes, and 6 flavored honey sticks. I try to buy produce at farm stands as much as I can because they're so close and way cheaper, plus support local farms. $9 + $1 donation to the farm. Total $10 7 p.m. — I go to the weekly all-you-can-eat salad-and-pizza buffet with friends. A friend pays for me, but I pay for my three glasses of wine and $5 worth of arcade games (I won a prize for my baby out of the claw machine, so totally worth it.) $20 Daily Total: $80",5,186
"6 a.m. — I re-up on gas. Again, I only go to the place that gives you a 10-cent-per-gallon discount when you go in and pay cash. 10 cents adds up! $18 10 a.m. — I eat a scrambled egg, avocado, and Tapatío taco that I packed from home. 12 p.m. — For lunch, I have a bowl of chicken, zucchini, brown rice, arugula, avocado, and yes, obviously, Tapatío that I bring from home. 3 p.m. — I buy Nancy Jo Sales' book I've loved Nancy Jo Sales since she wrote the piece on the Bling Ring in the 2000s, and social media and the minds of teen girls have always been so fascinating to me. $13 7 p.m. — Sometimes, a girl doesn't want to cook — even though she has a house full of groceries. I pick up a three-item combo plate at my favorite cash-only Chinese spot. I get chow mein, honey garlic chicken, steamed veggies, and spicy beef. This is so much food, I can split with the baby and still have leftovers. I also get a 7-Up. $9 7:30 p.m. — I go to my local wine store that specializes in great wines that don't break the bank. I go with a recommendation from the owner and get a bottle of Russian River Pinot noir. $22 9 p.m. — I eat the rest of my Chinese, drink some of the wine, and watch while I do a pearl sheet mask I got a couple weeks ago.

I wish I could get more products, but resist the urge to splurge. $30 12 p.m. — I eat cold chow mein leftovers (my favorite) for lunch. Chow mein gets so much better after it’s been in the fridge for awhile. 4 p.m. — Starbucks is not a normal thing for me, but I've had a long week, so grabbing a green tea lemonade and a marshmallow dream bar is totally justifiable. $7 6 p.m. — I break my spatula. It was bound to happen, since I got it from a thrift store years ago. I go to Ross and buy a new one so I can finish making dinner. $8 7 p.m. — I don’t feel like cooking a lot after that impromptu trip, so I just whip up some pasta with pesto, chicken, and zucchini. 11 p.m. — I unwind with wine while I read Nancy Jo Sales’ book and eat an ice cream sandwich I found in my freezer.

We also make a flatbread out of half a ball of prepared pizza dough from Whole Foods (which are so good and only $1.29!) and eat it with some hummus.

We pay for parking in a garage since there's an event downtown and it's all we can find — $7, but it's a joint expense, so we split. We share an appetizer and each order an entree and dessert.

Double feature! Daily Total: $4.50",4,188
"8 a.m. — I get up for work and there's no coffee left at home, so I make a triple 8-ounce soy latte when I get to the coffee shop. I also pick up a half-pound of Nicaraguan beans for home and eat a Clif Builder bar. 2:30 p.m. — When I get home, I have soy-and-ginger-marinated golden beets with pickled onion and rice for lunch. 7 p.m. — Relaxing tea and the last oatmeal cookies to unwind from a hectic day. 8 p.m. — We watch a movie from Hulu, and I have a snack of toast with avocado and tomato.

We also drink a lot of coffee. 12 p.m. — I run some (more!) errands to prepare for our trip to Europe: maps from Barnes & Noble ($26) and a crossbody bag from Walmart ($14). ($40 total) $20 1 p.m. — On a rare day off together, we hit up a coffee shop to grab some espresso and play gin rummy. I win. $4 2:30 p.m. — Since all that winning made me hungry, we stop by a Mediterranean restaurant. We order two massive meals with enough leftovers for next day's lunch.

"6:30 a.m. — It’s the most wonderful time of the year because…payday! This is the paycheck that isn’t swallowed up by my rent, so I’m always super happy when the 16th rolls around. I’m trying to be good, because I went a little over budget this past week, so I make coffee at home and take a bite of the spinach, onion, and sausage omelet I made for my mom. 7:30 a.m. — I already know this is going to be a long day because the train is extra crowded today, and I’m silently praying I make it to work on time and in one piece. I make an iced latte as soon as I get in. This new espresso machine is really a lifesaver. I try to avoid giving into my breakfast-sandwich craving, but the leftover mini bagel I grabbed from an earlier meeting is not cutting it. I end up ordering bacon and cheese on a bagel. My coworker kindly treats me. I promise to pay for our next craving cave-in. 8:30 a.m. — I’ve been waiting for a week to purchase the matte lipsticks I have saved in my online shopping bag from ColourPop cosmetics. I’m obsessed with lipsticks, especially matte ones. I buy six because they’re only $6 each, plus free shipping! $36 10 a.m. — I grab some fruit from the office kitchen. 2 p.m. — I check out Old Navy’s website after I see a neighbor’s coupon. The weather forecast for the next several days urges me to add to my wardrobe. I purchase a couple of dresses and jackets. I use a 30% off code sent to my email. $73.44 2:10 p.m. — I’m in a spending mood (as I am every payday) so I purchase a couple of songs off iTunes to keep me awake during my commute. $3.27 2:30 p.m. — I heat up a frozen chicken enchilada from my excursion to Whole Foods the day before; I grab an apple juice from our office fridge and a Girl Scout cookie from a now-communal stash. 7 p.m. — My sisters and I decided to have overnight girls’ night, so we booked a hotel room in the city through the Hotel Tonight app. When we get to the hotel, we find that they're completely sold out, so we can't upgrade from the standard one-bedroom that’s assigned at booking. Thankfully, we’re able to get a credit back on the app account to book another hotel. The Best Western Hospitality House turns out to be the only hotel with rooms to accommodate the three of us; it’s just a tad bit pricier than the last one, but we already planned to split all the hotel costs, so I only end up paying a fraction of the difference. $7.60 8:30 p.m. — We grab dinner while looking up other hotels options; it’s a Thai restaurant they’re both familiar with. I get the Thai fried rice with chicken and wonton soup. We split the bill. $20 10 p.m. — We finally get to our hotel, after a botched Uber ride. Everyone’s craving something sweet, so we hit up a nearby Duane Reade and stock up on snacks. Apparently I’m not as young as I thought, because I’m barely hanging on; I wait till we get back to the hotel and make a pot of decaf coffee to keep me awake through our sister-bonding night. $7.43 Daily Total: $147.74",1,189
"9:30 a.m. — Perks of staying at the Best Western rather than one of the fancier hotels in the city is the free breakfast! Eggs, bacon, fresh waffles, and unlimited coffee. I'll take that any day. 12:30 p.m. — Checkout. We were given the “Penthouse Suite"" (Best Western style) for our stay. It was pretty cute and spacious, with a nice balcony and view. My sister said it gave her a time-share vibe. The fee to upgrade was $46.50; we split it three ways. $15.50 2 p.m. — Back home I decide it's time to decrease the growing “dry-clean only"" pile on my couch. I take my favorite trench and midi skirt to be cleaned, and the skirt to be altered as well. My skirt costs $13 to alter and $7 to clean, and it's $15 for the trench to be cleaned. $35 4:15 p.m. — I stop at the Dollar Tree closest to my house on my way back from the gym and cleaners. I go in to buy safety pins, Tupperware to bring my lunches in next week, and two cards to congratulate my friends on the end of their first year of grad school. Somehow I end up with two bags of frozen foods, gifts, toiletries, and miscellaneous items. SMH. Is there a rehab for bargain-shopping addictions? I’m a sucker for a sale. $56.93 4:45 p.m. — I don’t want to do any more shopping after my $50 overspending moment, but I still need to pick up some items for lunch and dinner for the next week. I grab meats, a couple of Weight Watchers lunches, veggies, and dairy products. Since my mom handles the utility costs, I cover the groceries each month. Plus, I’m the better cook (shhh, don’t tell her I said that). I always make sure to check out the markets’ circulars before I go shopping. I find a jumbo carton of eggs for $1.25, yogurts with M&M toppings (2 for $1), and a 128 oz. bottle of vanilla almond milk for $4.99 at one of my local grocers. Didn’t I tell you I’m addicted to a sale? $33 6 p.m. — I make a half rotisserie chicken, sweet potato casserole, and broccoli for dinner with the groceries I bought today. I put a serving aside for my lunch during the week. Daily Total: $140.43",2,189
"8:45 a.m. — Manage to make a cup of coffee before church this morning. My mom’s friend, who picks us up sometimes, brings us pastries from this bakery in the Bronx. Thank you, Jesus. 2 p.m. — It’s such a nice day out; I treat mom and myself to helados (a frozen, sorbet-like treat), from one of the pushcart vendors while we walk home from church. I get a rainbow/mango mix, she opts for plain coconut. $2 4 p.m. — I decide to make this stew I saw online. It seems like it would yield enough portions for a few lunches and dinners. It consists of sweet Italian sausage, corn, black beans, zucchini, bell peppers, and onions. It turns out yummy! 9:45 p.m. — Against my better self-imposed retail judgment I check out Lord & Taylor’s website. It’s the last day of the Family & Friends sale. I see a cute jacket for my mom. Mother’s Day Gift? Check! $28.45 Daily Total: $30.45",3,189
"6 a.m. — Coffee at home. 6:45 a.m. — I buy a couple more songs to get me through my commute because I’ve played the other three to death over the weekend. $2.58 10:15 a.m. — It’s that special time of month. I’m not really hungry, but after popping a few Advil, I grab a cup of coffee and a piece of toast from the office kitchen. The yogurt I brought for breakfast has lost its appeal. 1 p.m. – I eat the lunch of chicken, sweet potatoes, and broccoli I prepared on Day Two. 2 p.m. – I make a cup of tea in the office to soothe my cramps. 7 p.m. – I stop by the grocery store on the way home, since I’ve run out of my favorite French Vanilla creamer I use for my morning coffee. I grab a bag of sweet plantain chips at the checkout line. $6.48 8 p.m. — I’m still not hungry, so I make a multi-ingredient baked omelet that I cut up into squares for my breakfast this week. The smell of the bacon makes me second-guess my plan to forgo dinner completely; I throw in a few extra pieces to put on a piece of toast. #Dinner. Daily Total: $9.06",4,189
"6:30 a.m. — Coffee at home. 7:30 a.m. — I forgot to bring an omelet square for breakfast. My appetite’s still on its monthly fritz, but I grab a bombolini, one of my favorite pastry treats, from the restaurant next door to my job to go with the latte I plan to make when I get in. $2.18 10 a.m. — One of my coworkers has on a really cute white button-down. It reminds me that I’ve been meaning to purchase a wrinkle-free one. I find one on Nordstrom’s website. It’s not exactly the style I had in mind, and they only have it in a bigger size, but for the price I’ll make it work! $35.44 12:30 p.m. — My coworker sent an earlier email about pastries near her desk; I decide to check them out. I take two mini cupcakes, vanilla and red velvet. I go to the office kitchen to make a latte to go with my mini cakes. I happen upon some slices of rye bread and a hazelnut spread from a breakfast meeting. Don’t judge me. I consider that lunch. 2:30 p.m. — Mid-day boredom kicks in. I “happen upon” DSW’s website and “happen” to find some cute loafers for work. Don’t give me judge-y eyes. Yes, I know I’m addicted to sweets, sales, and shopping. They’re needed though! My favorite leopard loafers have lost some of their faux fur, and I don’t know how much longer they can last. Added bonus: DSW always has free shipping over $35. $39.95 5:20 p.m. — Third latte of the day. Hey, I need energy for the gym tonight. 6:15 p.m. — My favorite store is CVS. Ask my mother, and she’d tell you I go in there at least once a week, armed with coupons, because that’s the best part. THE COUPONS. I’ve run out of tampons and I have a $1-off coupon for a particular brand, so I grab those. I call my friend who I’m working out with tonight; he plans on grabbing water but I tell him I’ll grab one for the both of us. I scan my CVS card to see if I have any relevant coupons and to my surprise I HAVE FIVE EXTRA CARE BUCKS! Woohoo! Night. Made. I grab a pack of gum in the checkout line because I also printed a coupon for 50 cents off. I throw in a fig bar at the last moment, too. I check out with my Extra Care Bucks, coupons, and surprise sale items. $3.54 9 p.m. — After the gym, I head home and have some leftover stew I made on Day Three. Mom’s clearly been enjoying it. Daily Total: $81.11",5,189
"7 a.m. — I barely slept last night, because I was anxious about a meeting I’m having today with my new boss. My stomach’s feeling the anxiety, too. I don’t want to eat anything, so I just grab a coffee at work to hopefully counter the bags under my eyes. 11 a.m. — Meeting with the boss went well, and my anxiety has lifted. I heat up an omelet square I made on Day Four, along with a piece of toast and sausage I had stored in the fridge. There’s also a smorgasbord of pastries and fruit leftover from a breakfast meeting — I grab a mini whole wheat bagel and smear it with peanut butter and butter. I also make a latte. 11:45 a.m. — I guess my anxiety was masking how hungry I really was. I go back for a second bagel, more peanut butter, more butter. 5:30 p.m. — I grab some grapes, a bag of bananas, and bag of gummy worms from the supermarket. The bananas are only 49 cents a pound; I get about six for 98 cents. Win! $8.01  8 p.m. — I pop some frozen pot stickers and a veggie egg roll in the microwave for dinner. I’ll regret this in the morning. Daily Total: $8.01",6,189
"6 a.m. — Regret Land. My stomach is not agreeing with the frozen apps from last night. Maybe I shouldn’t have had so many. I’m a sucker for dumplings and Asian appetizers. I still make coffee at home because…sleep. 7:30 a.m. — The skirt I had altered on Day Two is super tight. I grab a yogurt from my snack stash. It’s the 50-cent one with M&Ms I picked up on Day Two. The yogurt itself is definitely not great, but the candy makes it satisfactory. 8 a.m. — Why are my eyes burning?! Total sign of caffeine deficiency. I make a double espresso. 12:30 p.m. — I heat up my leftover stew. There’s also a quinoa salad in the kitchen from a lunch meeting; I throw a few tablespoons in with my stew. 1:10 p.m. — My coworker alerts me to a snack-pocalypse in the kitchen. I eat a snickerdoodle cookie. 9 p.m. — Go to my niece’s school recital; she plays the drums in the jazz band. I’m truly not saying this because she’s my niece, but she is THE BEST out of all her peers, a Sheila E in the making. Afterward, we stop for a snack. I make a beeline for the Dunkin Donuts. I order an apple fritter, a Dunkaccino (Dunkin Donuts’ version of a cappuccino) and a chicken salad sandwich on a bagel. $8.63 Daily Total: $8.63",7,189
"8 a.m. — Get up at 8 a.m., internship starts at 10 a.m. Have breakfast at home, which means a bowl of cereal, a slice of toast with olive oil and edam cheese, and coffee or OJ. Today it's coffee. Pack snacks for the morning (I’m constantly hungry): a peach, a muesli bar, and some dried cranberries. 3 p.m. — Meet my two best friends for lunch. We’re celebrating; we all got our theses approved this week and have been craving pizza for a few days. We eat two carbonara pizzas. $6.71 4:30 p.m. — It’s been awfully hot these past few days. Just walking down the street is torture, so we decide to reward ourselves further and go looking for an ice cream shop I spotted a few days ago and wanted to try in the district of Malasaña. We take forever deciding, because the flavors look so good. They get a pineapple, lime, and mango pop; I get cranberries and hibiscus. $3.35 6 p.m. — After six months of nonstop cold and rain and blizzards, my wardrobe needs some serious updates for this weather, and since we’re in a rewarding mood, we stop by Mango’s Outlet. We lose ourselves for about two hours in there. The discounts are really good. I buy a dress, a shirt, a pair of pants, a tank top, and a belt for €35. We keep walking and spot a cute shoe store, I go in looking for some wedge sandals and find ones I like, but they haven’t got any left in my size. I go home and eat more ice cream for dinner because I’m still full of pizza. $39.12 Daily Total: $49.18",1,190
"8 a.m. — Breakfast is the same as yesterday, except instead of cereal, it’s a bowl of oatmeal with cinnamon and honey. (I finished the cereal yesterday.) I get this weird comfort from eating the same breakfast every day. I pack a banana, some dried cranberries, and a muesli bar. 10 a.m. — Internship hours, pretty much the same as yesterday. 3 p.m. — Go home for lunch. I whip up my lazy food: a bowl of brown rice and quinoa with broccoli, grilled chicken, mushrooms, some parsley, and lime. I’m planning a trip to see my sister, who’s living in the south of Spain, so I book the rental car we’ll be using when I’m there. (Unusual purchase!) $72.64 8 p.m. — A friend from Mexico is in town for work, so we agree to meet later for drinks. I ask her to let me know when she’s in her hotel so I can pick her up, but she’s pretty late, so I wander around, window-shopping because I need a new bikini. We go to the Mercado de San Ildefonso with her coworker and order cañas and tinto de verano (red summer wine). My friend pays for the first round. We keep talking and talking and talking; we have a lot of catching up to do! Her coworker pays for the second round, and I get the last one and some patatas bravas (potatoes with spicy sauce) for all of us. $17.88 11 p.m. — We leave San Ildefonso with a slight buzz, but it’s only 11 p.m., so we decide to walk around to show my friend some other parts of Madrid. Her coworker decides to call it a day, so we go off by ourselves. We walk all over, stop in another bar for some more tinto de verano, and then finally just buy a bottle of water each (€3 euros for the wine and €1 for the water). $4.47 1:30 a.m. — I finally drop her off at her hotel and catch the last subway home. Daily Total: $94.99",2,190
"7 a.m. — I wake up too early, with a slight hangover. I’m pondering going back to sleep, but my boyfriend texts me, and we decide to talk. He has been super busy at work lately, and the time difference (eight freaking hours) makes it hard to find time to talk. It’s almost midnight for him, but we talk for about two hours. I’ve missed him. I eat breakfast after, same story, but with yogurt because I'm out of milk. 9 a.m. — I’m running out of food, so I decide to go grocery shopping before starting work. Going to the grocery store is my main workout, since I have to carry all the stuff I buy while walking back to my apartment. I get plain cereal, skim milk, some bananas, cherries, tomatoes, cucumbers, cheese, quinoa, cookies, yogurt, some Iberico ham, fresh bread, chips, and hummus. $20.12 2 p.m. — I got an offer yesterday to review and translate some documents, so I plan to work on that today. The pay is good, €120 for two documents, because they need them ready ASAP. I eat some hummus and cheese for lunch while working. 6 p.m. — My roommates are both Spanish, and this weekend, they’re both in their hometowns (almost nobody who lives in Madrid is actually from Madrid), so I’ve got the apartment to myself and my best friends are coming over. My friends arrive, and we decide on sushi and sangria. We walk over to a great sushi place that’s near my apartment, and to a mini market to buy the stuff to make sangria. We order some rolls, gyozas, and spicy-sweet sesame chicken to go. One of my friends has recently broken up with her longtime (six years!) boyfriend, and this is our girls-night/recovery session, so obviously we need ice cream. We pick up some Häagen-Dazs on our way home. We split all the costs. $16.76 7 p.m. — We make way too much sangria, so we get kind of tipsy, eat sushi, watch (to suck out the feeling that a happy relationship is possible), and talk our ears off until 3 a.m. Daily Total: $36.88",3,190
"10 a.m. — We wake up late and make pancakes for breakfast. Then we head over to El Rastro, Madrid’s most renowned flea market. We walk around for about an hour, looking at antique lamps, coins, keys, and everything else you can think of, not buying anything until we spot a used-books stand. I rummage through the piles and finally buy a book for €1. Score! We head back to my place because it’s way too hot, drink the last of the sangria we made, watch some trash TV, and then they head home. $1.12 2 p.m. — I spend the rest of the day in a heat daze, make a cucumber-tomato salad, and keep working on the documents. They have cut the deadline by a day, so I’ve got to step it up. I make some scrambled eggs for dinner and go to sleep early. Daily Total: $1.12",4,190
"8 a.m. — Breakfast. Cereal, toast, and coffee again. 10 a.m. — Internship hours, with my break food again: a banana, some chips, and a lot of water. It’s way too hot today. 3 p.m. — I go out to lunch in a bar nearby. I order some pinchos (small slices of bread with different stuff on them), two salmon ones and another with tomato and mushrooms, and a beer. Everyone drinks beer here, any hour, any day. $7.82 4:30 p.m. — I meet up with some classmates to print our theses. We have to turn in three hard copies and one digital copy in a CD. We get a discount at the printers if we’re a group. The man at the store tells us he’ll have them ready tomorrow, since they need to be bound. We’ll pay when we pick them up. I head home on the bus and commit myself to finishing the documents. 8 p.m. — I watch the Spanish electoral debate on TV while eating dinner, which is some noodle soup that my roommate brought, and more water. This heat is driving me crazy. Daily Total: $7.82",5,190
"8 a.m. — Eat breakfast at home again. The only variation is that today, I feel like coffee on my way to the internship, so I stop by a coffee shop and have a small black coffee with skim milk and buy two cookies. $2.79 10 a.m. — Crazy morning at the office. I eat my packed snacks and leave a little late. I have to go pick up the hard copies of my thesis from the printers, plus finish the documents before 7 p.m. The people I’m working for are in another time zone, so they need them by that time. 3:30 p.m. — I get to the printer’s, and it’s closed. Funny Spanish schedules — it seems I’ll never get the hang of them. A lot of places close between 2 and 4:30 p.m. in the afternoon for “lunch.” After a year here, this still happens to me too much. As I have not had lunch, I decide to go eat something myself while waiting. I stop by a café that offers a salad, an olive-and-prosciutto panini, and a beverage for €6. I eat slowly and wait for 4:30. It’s totally normal for someone here to order just a cup of coffee and stay for two hours in a place, so I’m not bothered by anyone. $6.71 4:30 p.m. — Finally. I practically open the shop alongside the owner. One of my classmates arrives soon after, and we pick up our theses. I’m so excited to see the hard copy, after so many months of poring over my laptop, it’s like my baby’s born! I pay for the three copies and the CD, I’ll have to turn it in tomorrow, because the university stops admitting the documents at 4 p.m. It’s crazy with these schedules, I tell you. $42.47 5:30 p.m. — I get home and treat myself to some ice cream I bought about two weeks ago and had forgotten I had. Then I cram until I finish the documents and send them just in time. Phew! I lounge around a bit, watching Netflix and half dozing off. I eat a banana with peanut butter and some hummus and chips for dinner, since I’m in low-energy mode. Daily Total: $51.97",6,190
"8 a.m. — Same breakfast routine. 10 a.m. — I get to the office and ask my boss if I can leave earlier, so I can get to the university in time. I’ve agreed to meet up with my two best friends, so we can turn in our theses together. It’s silly, but after suffering all these months together and being each other’s support system, we’re excited. We’re nerds like that. My boss says it’s okay, so I just whizz through all the stuff I have to do. 2 p.m. — I leave for the university. I take the metro and get there in 20 minutes. I meet my friends, and we take a goofy picture with our “babies” before turning them in. It’s done! 3 p.m. — I have lunch with my friends in a café near the University. We have been going there all year, and now it feels weird to know it’s all coming to an end. I order a pasta salad with sun-dried tomatoes and olives, a small cup of fruit, and an iced tea. $9.50 5 p.m. — I wander a bit on my way home. It’s not good for my budget to live so near Gran Via, the street where all shops are. I browse a bit in H&M and decide to get a bikini for when I visit my sister. But I remember I’ve got a coupon at home, so I hold the thought for another day. These days, I’m starting to shop for stuff I want to take home, since it’s my last month here. I get some pants that are on sale at another store, and some sunglasses. $31.29 6 p.m. — I stop by the market down the street for some bread and a six-pack; my roommates and I are watching a game tonight at home. Cherry season has started, so I also pick up a tray. $10.06 Daily Total: $50.85",7,190
"6:30 a.m. — Wake up, shower, ponder going to work early. Decide against it. Work from home in the morning. Consider buying coffee on way to work, but remember before leaving that I have coffee concentrate and half-and-half in the fridge. Fill to-go cup and head to office at 10:30 a.m. I take the subway and swipe my Metro card (pay-as-you-go): $2.75 12:30 p.m. — Am starving. Planned to grab something fast inside my office, but get invited out to order food at an Asian fusion place with some other girls. Order as a group and I pick up the tab. $153, but reimbursable from work. 3:30 p.m. — Stuck on a long call and dying for a snack. Remember that I packed cherries and sugar snap peas before I left for work in the morning. Nosh while awaiting my turn to speak. 7:30 p.m. — Hungry and stuck at work for a few more hours. Decide to order Indian food — chicken curry, naan, and samosas. $29, but work pays. 8:45 p.m. — Still at work. Decide to go get a wax (not a weekly expense) at the place near my office to: 1) wake up and 2) prepare for the weekend. Momentarily curse the female grooming tax. Definitely awake now. $70 (with tip) 11 p.m. — Order car and go home. Car home is paid for by work ($40). 11:30 p.m. — Snack on more cherries and some Rice Krispies Treats after getting home. 1:10 a.m. — Watch DVR to catch up on some shows while browsing Amazon. End up buying a random Korean skin-care product. $4.79 Daily Total: $77.54 ($299.54, $222 reimbursed)",1,191
"9:30 a.m. — Wake up grateful for air conditioning. Am so dehydrated from barely drinking water yesterday that I down a flavored water from Juice Press before I leave the house. (I bought a bunch over the weekend; they are $2.75 each). Subway to work. $2.75 10 a.m. — Off the subway and already sweltering. Can't resist stopping for cold brew and a muffin at my favorite coffee place. I justify it by telling myself it is motivation to get through my 10:30 call. $7.21 1 p.m. — So busy at work I didn't end up eating my muffin. Decide not to bother and I go out to get hot food: baked salmon, steamed spinach, and mac 'n' cheese. $8 2:30 p.m. — Realize Virgin America is having a big sale on airline tickets and it covers dates when I have a wedding to attend. I bought my ticket months ago, but take advantage of the sale to buy my boyfriend's ticket (already had money set aside in my budget for it). $366 7:45 p.m. — Thought I would get out early from work, but it's just not happening, so I order dinner. Braised greens, pulled pork, and Brussels sprouts. I also order a milkshake, but toss most of it in the garbage. $32 (work pays). 10 p.m. — Browsing Net-A-Porter in car home from work. Manage to resist the sales. $40 for car (work pays). 10:30 p.m. — Home, waiting on documents to come back. I eat cherries and Rice Krispies Treats and drink lots of sparking water. Browsing Sephora and Net-A-Porter, but manage to resist temptation again. Total: $383.96 ($455.96, $72 reimbursed)",2,191
"6:30 a.m. — Wake up and contemplate making a smoothie to save money on breakfast, but the sound of a Vitamix this early in the morning is unbearable. Pick up an iced coffee on the way to the subway, instead. ($4 with tip). Subway ride to work ($2.75). $6.75 12:30 p.m. — Go out and grab a turkey sandwich with avocado, potato chips, and pickles. And because I can't resist, a cookie at the checkout. $7.75 2:30 p.m. — Realize I need a coffee to make it through the afternoon. Grab a friend from the office and run down to Starbucks. Grande iced latte and snacks for the office comes to $22.50 (reimbursed by work). 6:30 p.m. — Pick up dry cleaning on way home from work ($68). Subway home ($2.75). $70.75 7:15 p.m. — Stop to pick up some groceries. Buy cherries, grapes, watermelon, blueberries, cereal, matzo, cream cheese, sugar-free Jell-O pudding, rotisserie chicken, chocolate syrup, marshmallows, butter. I'm always amazed at how much cheaper it is to buy groceries instead of ordering in every meal. I could probably save if I ate at home more often or paid enough attention to prices at the grocery store, to be honest. I don’t cook so much as assemble snacks. Eat some rotisserie chicken, piece of matzo with cream cheese and dried apricots, and a Jell-O pudding with whipped cream for dinner and dessert. $35.89 8 p.m. — Have call from 8 to 9 p.m. tonight, so am stuck at home and can't go out with friends, thus saving at least $40 (average cost of two cocktails and a shared snack at my favorite local bar). I count this as a win. 11 p.m. — Heat up some pizza I made earlier this week for a late-night snack. Waiting for emails to come in on a deal, so I browse Sephora and, since it's 8% back on Ebates, decide to splurge on some lipstick, moisturizer, sunscreen, and highlighter. $139.36 .

"9 a.m. — Housecleaner is running late and I have to be at work for 10 a.m. meeting. Leave tip ($45) on table, give her the keys, and jump into a cab to make it to work in time ($34.56). Traffic on the FDR is the worst. I just couldn't fathom taking the subway and being sweaty and stressed about being late. $79.56 2:30 p.m. — Starving, so I grab a couple of girls from the office and run out to grab food. Stop at Lady M Cake shop and Jacques Torres for snacks and coffee. We spend $39.50 at Lady M for cake and $9 at Jacques Torres (all reimbursed by work). Eat slice of passion fruit Lady M crepe cake and iced coffee for lunch, along with some random snacks. 4:30 p.m. — Tired of work and unmotivated. Call my coworker and we go to Capital Grille for drinks and snacks. Several glasses of wine and multiple beers later, head to a party together. $117.44 (reimbursed by work). 8:30 p.m. — Drink several more glasses of Champagne and head home. Decide I'm too tired and I drank too much to bear the subway, so I cab it home. $30 Total: $109.56 ($275.50, $165.94 reimbursed)",4,191
"7 a.m. — Up early on a Saturday to move my boyfriend's car for street-cleaning rules. I don't like paying $38 a day to park in a garage in my neighborhood, so I drive around for 10 minutes until I find a spot a short block away. Score! Stop for an almond milk latte at my favorite coffee shop on my way home. $5 8:15 a.m. — I told my boyfriend I would make dinner tonight, so I go to the grocery store early to beat the crowds. Buy crackers, key lime pie, mango sorbet, diced onions, organic peas, parsley, thyme, kosher chicken, organic chicken broth, mushrooms, leeks, and carrots. I'll make homemade crust and we'll have chicken pot pie for dinner and key lime pie for dessert. I don't cook or buy groceries very often, so I buy organic produce and high-quality meat whenever I do buy food to cook. It's still cheaper than going out. $38.11. 10:45 a.m. — Early to my hair appointment and hungry. I grab an egg, avocado, and cheese sandwich and an iced coffee while waiting. $9.80 1 p.m. — Cut and color done. I've been going to the same place for several years and have a standing appointment every eight weeks. Needless to say, this is not a weekly expense. $249.91 (including tip) 1:30 p.m. — Have some time to kill before brunch, so I pop into Chanel and browse. End up buying a new summer lipgloss. $40.28 2 p.m. — Brunch in Soho with a friend. Have Caesar salad, lobster roll, and cocktail. Pick up the tab. $121.25 (reimbursed by work). 3:45 p.m. — Stop at Sur La Table to buy supplies for dinner on the way home. $26.13 7:30 p.m. — Boyfriend and I sit down for a homecooked meal made with the groceries. 12:15 a.m. — Home from a party. Since my boyfriend drove instead of taking cabs there and back, I order him an ice cream sundae from a diner as a treat. Add curly fries to hit the order minimum. $13.54 Daily Total: $382.77 ($504.02, $121.25 reimbursed)",5,191
"10 a.m. — Wake up and prepare cold brew coffee with half-and-half from the groceries. Prepare muffins, chicken sausage patties, and scrambled eggs for breakfast at home instead of going out. 4 p.m. — Decide we want a cookie cake (like Mrs. Fields) for a snack. Check my baking supplies and decide I have enough ingredients to make one from scratch. Defrost some homemade frosting and prepare the cookie cake. 6:30 p.m. — Eat leftovers for dinner. 9 p.m. — Eat cheese and crackers while watching Olympic trials on TV. Daily Total: $0",6,191
"10 a.m. — Stop for lotto tickets while dreaming of what I would do if I hit the jackpot. I don't win anything. $3 1 p.m. — Run out for a cold brew coffee. $5. 2:15 p.m. — Grab a quick lunch: grilled chicken salad and curly fries. $8 8:30 p.m. — Tired and hot, so I decide to take a cab home from work. $18 (Uber sale!) 9 p.m. — Arrive home hungry. Have a piece of matzo with cream cheese and a couple of pot stickers. Order noodles from Chinese restaurant. $10.71 Daily Total: $44.71",7,191
"11:30 a.m. — Breakfast at work. I eat all of my meals late. I keep peanut butter, oatmeal, and trail mix at work and always bring a banana so I can mix and match. 3 p.m. — I eat a salad I brought from home with greens, sorghum, sauteed carrots and mushrooms, and halloumi cheese. I stayed up until midnight last night food-prepping, because I didn't have time to do it earlier. This salad makes it worth it. 4:45 p.m. — I head to the gym after work and stop by Kroger (grocery store), which is right next door. I’ve been feeling really worn out today, so I get a Powerade Zero. I also get some corn tortillas because I’m out and they’re a staple. $3 7 p.m. — I make some quick tacos for dinner with the tortillas and ingredients I had around, and watch two episodes of (finally catching up). 8 p.m. — My sister is coming to visit in a few days, and I’m making her some natural beauty products for a birthday present. I go to a local natural/health-food store and get a grapefruit (I’m going to use the peel for a toner) and some glass jars and containers for my concoctions ($11). I talk myself out of buying all of the delicious, overpriced food that they have. I still need one more jar of a specific size, so I run to Target to get it from the dollar section. Of course, I end up wandering around and get four La Croix and a little basil plant, too ($8). $19 10:30 p.m. — My boyfriend comes over so we can watch , and he brings me guacamole from his dinner stop on the way over. I use it to make more tacos, since I’m still hungry. Daily Total: $22",1,192
"12 p.m. — Breakfast at work again, and plenty of free office coffee. It’s not great, but I had to do grad-school student-loan paperwork last night, and it scared me into trying to save more money. 2 p.m. — I always use my lunch break to take a walk, so today I walk to CVS and get a birthday card for my grandma. Cards are very overpriced and very cheesy, but I do my best. $5 3 p.m. — My boyfriend and I are going to New York next month to visit some of my family and friends, so I finally bite the bullet and buy plane tickets ($600). I put them on my new credit card, which earns miles, so at least I can use those for something in the future. Tickets are $300 each, and he’ll pay me back for his share. This is an unusual purchase for me. $300 5 p.m. — I bring two bags of clothes to a consignment store to sell. They only offer to take two items for $7, which is annoying but better than nothing. 5:15 p.m. — I’m starving and need a couple things at the store, so I run next door to Kroger and get some food from the salad bar, along with soy milk (I use a $1 off coupon, yay me!) and gluten-free crackers. It totals to $7, so I basically got it for free, right? $7 8 p.m. — One of my friends who moved away two months ago is back in town on her way to a wedding, and is crashing with me for the night. We get dinner at a vegan place I’ve been wanting to try. I get a rice-noodle-and-vegetable dish, but it’s super bland so I only eat a bit ($11). I’m going to take the leftovers home and add sauce. We get a drink at a cheap pub nearby ($4), then go to another bar for another drink. We also split grits because neither of us was satisfied with dinner ($11). $26 Daily Total: $338",2,192
"8:40 a.m. — We stayed up too late last night, and office coffee isn’t gonna cut it. I walk to Starbucks and reload my card with $10, then get an Americano. $10 12 p.m. — Finally get around to breakfast at the office. I have some leftover zucchini bread that I made a while ago with peanut butter (I keep a jar at work) and trail mix from home. 2:30 p.m. — After walking outside for half an hour in muggy heat, I eat some nuts and more Powerade. 3:15 p.m. — Lunch at my desk. I have another carrot-and-sorghum salad (I made two when I meal prepped). It’s just as delicious as the first one, even though it’s been three days. 8 p.m. — It’s date night! We go to an Indian restaurant for dinner. It’s delicious, and he pays (even better!). We walk around afterward and end up at a bar down the street. I buy us drinks, and we play a game of pool. $8 11 p.m. — We both have to work in the morning, so it’s sort of an early night. Daily Total: $18",3,192
"10:15 a.m. — I’m working at the grocery store 10:30 a.m. to 7 p.m. today. I go to the Panera next door before my shift starts to get a coffee and scarf down a banana I brought. $2 2 p.m. — I buy some olives and a dolma from the olive bar to have with my lunch, because it looked especially good today. Last night, I threw together a lunch of sorghum, spinach, roasted squash, cheese, liquid aminos, and sesame oil, so that I didn’t have to buy it at work. After I eat that, I’m too full to eat the olives, so I save them for later. $3 5 p.m. — I buy a bottle of cold-brew coffee from the store because I’m not going to make it to 7 without it. Also, I eat those olives. $3 7 p.m. — Freedom! I pick up a few things before I leave, to take advantage of sales and my 20% discount. I get: 2 pounds of strawberries, coconut water, sweet-potato chips, mixed nuts, an apple, and the most adorable potted sunflower, because they’re my favorite. I realize I shop and eat like a rabbit. Some weeks I put together detailed meal plans and do a big grocery shop, but lately my schedule has been so unpredictable that I end up wasting food. It’s been better for me to buy small amounts at a time and combine them with staples from my pantry so nothing goes bad. $12 8 p.m. — We go to a friend’s housewarming party. They had to do a lot of renovations, and it’s finally done enough to visit, so they want to celebrate. I have an unopened bottle of wine, so we bring that. 1:30 a.m. — I get home from the party absolutely starving, so I eat a corn tortilla with hummus, some crackers and salsa, and a piece of cheese. Good enough to last me until morning. Daily Total: $20",4,192
"9 a.m. — My sister and her boyfriend are coming to town for the day (they’re college students in Cincinnati), so I spend the morning cleaning and finishing her belated birthday present. Nothing like last minute! 11:30 a.m. — We go to brunch at one of my favorite spots. I get my usual: an omelet with three types of veggies and goat cheese. $15 1:30 p.m. — We decide to go to an outdoor show with local bands, and stop by the store on the way to get drinks since it’s so hot outside. I buy some orange juice and lemonade for us. $5 2:30 p.m. — There’s a booth at the show with local crafts and products made from all-recycled materials. I buy keychains for myself and the boy. $6 3:30 p.m. — The music was pretty decent, but it was so hot we couldn’t stay for long. We go to 21C, a hotel/art museum/restaurant/bar. The museum part is free and has some great exhibits. I offer to buy drinks, but the only person to take me up on it is my boyfriend. I buy him a gin and tonic, which is supremely expensive (compared to other places in the area). They make their own tonic, though, so at least it’s good. $11 5:30 p.m. — We get to the sushi place I wanted to take my sister to, but the wait is 30 minutes and they have to head home soon. We go to a different sushi restaurant a few doors down, and while the ambience isn’t quite as nice, it’s delicious. I get a veggie roll and a side of rice, and plan to eat a little more once I get home. $14 7 p.m. — My sister and her bf leave, and I go to my boyfriend’s parents’ house with him so we can do laundry. They’re very sweet, and let me do it there for free, which is a money saver and much more pleasant than waiting around in a Laundromat. We hang out and watch some (another TV show I’m finally getting around to), and I snack on some cheese. My boyfriend's laundry takes forever, so I'll have to come back. 11:30 p.m. — I eat a bowl of cereal before I go to bed. Dinner? Daily Total: $51",5,192
"11:30 a.m. — I eat an apple and peanut butter at work, and some trail mix, too (even though I was trying to save it for later...oops). 3:45 p.m. — Lunch at my desk — another sorghum-and-veggie mash-up. I don’t mind eating the same/similar thing for days on end when it’s so good! 5 p.m. — Go to the gym after work and then pop over to the grocery store for bananas, a protein bar (you know, for the gains), banana chips, and some baby kale. $7 7:30 p.m. — Do my laundry, read, catch up on life, and eat some veggies and hummus. 11 p.m. — Stop by the bf’s on my way home because he got me ice cream that I’d been craving. I eat a little of that, we chat, and I call it a night. Daily Total: $7",6,192
"8 a.m. — I drop my car off at the mechanic and bike the rest of the way to work. Fingers crossed it’s not an expensive fix. 11:30 a.m. — My parents have an Amazon Prime account, so I browse the deals. I ran out of face wash a couple days ago, and while it was made from “all natural” ingredients, I’m trying to simplify my beauty products. I decided to give the oil-cleansing method a shot and have been researching best oils to use (but putting off buying them because they’re expensive). Amazon has a bottle of argan oil on sale, so I go ahead and buy it. It's about what I was paying for my face wash anyway. $11 12:15 p.m. — I eat a banana and peanut butter (what else) at my desk for breakfast. 2:15 p.m. — My boyfriend is off work today, so he meets me for lunch downtown. We go to Chipotle because (besides it being delicious) I have a coupon for free chips and guac. I get a veggie bowl and end up saving most of the chips and guac because I’m so full. $7 5 p.m. — I bike all the way home because my car isn’t ready yet. Luckily it’s not far, and it’s nice to get some exercise after being cooped up in an office all day. 6 p.m. — Bike back to the mechanic to get my car. It ends up costing $300, which is a bummer since I don’t exactly have extra money lying around, but I know he charged me a fair price. Plus, this is the first time I’ve had to take my car in for a problem, and I’ve had it for almost a year and a half, so it’s not too bad. $300 6:30 p.m. — I make some food with ingredients I already have. I have enchilada sauce, but corn tortillas tend to break if I roll them up for enchiladas, so instead I make a type of “Mexican lasagna.” Basically, it’s layers of tortillas, beans, cheese, baby kale, zucchini, salsa, and sauce. I make it in a big dish so that I’ll have lunches for a few days. I’m running late to my small group (for church), so I have to leave my food to cool while I’m gone. 9 p.m. — My boyfriend and I are going to go see a movie at 9:30, so I buy snacks beforehand and eat dinner while I wait. He buys the movie tickets — what a gem. $3 Daily Total: $321",7,192

Will be moving to Park Slope with two roommates. $200 7 p.m. — Made caprese salad for dinner from my WF haul. Daily Total: $234",1,193
"9 a.m. — Cereal for breakfast at home. I’m not a huge breakfast person, but my commute is pretty long right now, so if I don’t eat before work, I show up super hangry. Honey Nut Cheerios are the solution. 1 p.m. — Brought my own lunch to work, but some coworkers invited me to join them in the cafeteria, so I paid $5 for a sandwich. Seems worth it to socialize at my new job! $5 7 p.m. — Mac 'n' cheese for dinner. It’s Kraft-style, but since it’s from Whole Foods, it’s healthy, right? Daily Total: $5",2,193
"10 a.m. — Have breakfast at the office since I slept through my alarm and didn’t eat at home. They have fruit, peanut butter, coffee, and some other snacks, so I don’t have to spend any money. 12 p.m. — Office coffee #2. The Starbucks around the corner is tempting, but I can’t justify spending money on lattes when they’re free at work. 2 p.m. — Brought my lunch to work; some frozen Trader Joe’s meal I found in the back of my freezer, supplemented with snacks from work. 7 p.m. — It’s unreasonably hot, so I pop into Starbucks mid-commute for an iced tea. $3 8 p.m. — Stop by Trader Joe’s to grab something for dinner. Craving Kung Pao cauliflower I got there last week. $5 Daily Total: $8",3,193

I get a sweater. $40 6 p.m. — Pop into the grocery store for some spinach, mozzarella, and pesto. $12 9 p.m. — Order new sneakers online from Free People. Mine are super worn out, and these will be cute enough for the gym the office.

I typically make anywhere from $75 to $300 a month freelancing. $30 3 p.m. — Vegan ice cream, since it felt like a hundred degrees outside. $5 4 p.m. — Tacos and margaritas with my friend from out of town.

Cheese fries at a 24-hour diner before heading home. $9 Daily Total: $73",7,193

I get chocolate, salmon filets, soup, frozen mashed potatoes, granola bars, and a lemon. $26.10 9 p.m. — My grandma has made fish and veggies for dinner, which we eat while watching some TV.

I get ready and head to work. 1:15 p.m. — I head out for lunch with a few girls from my work. I get pasta and an orange soda, which costs me $10.30, but I used one of my meal tickets and end up only paying $0.68. 3 p.m. — I'm bored at work and looking at beauty and fashion blogs.

I go back to work at 2 p.m. for more meetings. $5.45 6 p.m. — Once again, I am bored at work and browsing clothing websites looking for a work-appropriate dress.

I pay. $4.90 8 p.m. — After dropping my sister at my place, I go pick up my best friend from the train station. We head back to my place to drop off her bags, and then go to a Spanish tapas restaurant. I order two glasses of sangria and a Spanish tortilla, and we eat lots of bread.

"8:15 a.m. — I didn't sleep very well because my sister kept moving in her sleep and she woke me up at 7 a.m. when she had to go to school. I have my usual breakfast of bread and Nutella. I get to work late (as usual) and work while snacking on chocolate. 1:15 p.m. — I go out for lunch. My favorite place doesn't have the sandwich that I like so I go to another place.

We decide to organize a middle school reunion for all the people who are living in Paris. $23.30 1 a.m. — We go to another bar, but when we try to get a drink they say that they only take cash. We don't have any cash left, so we call an Uber to head home, and I pay. When we reach home, we eat a lot of bread to try to sober up before going to bed. $16.00 Daily Total: $50.05",5,194
"10 a.m. — One of my friends who lives in the U.S. calls to tell me about her date. We talk for a while until I get hungry. I go to the kitchen but realize that we ate all the bread last night when we got home. I have a glass of orange juice. I also clean the house a bit since we left a mess before going out last night. 12:30 p.m. — We're both starving so we head out for lunch and decide to go to a little burger place to get burgers and fries. My friend pays for the meal to pay me back for the drinks and Uber from last night. 2 p.m. — We spend an hour walking around the neighborhood until she has to meet up with some other friends. Before heading home, I stop by a bookstore and get two books. $15.60 4:15 p.m. — On my way home, I stop by the bakery to get a baguette and a chocolate pastry. At home, I watch an episode of (my guilty pleasure) while eating my pastry and doing my makeup. I head out of the house at 5 p.m. to go to church for my cousin's communion. The church is on the opposite side of Paris so I have to leave early to make sure I'm not late. $2.30 7:45 p.m. — Mass finally ends, and I head to my uncle's house for a quick glass of champagne before heading home. My friend has been waiting for me at home for half an hour already, and she's sitting in the lobby because she doesn't have the keys to get inside the apartment. I really want to take an Uber home, but force myself to take the metro to save money. 9 p.m. — I make pasta for dinner for my friend and me. We were supposed to go out, but we're both pretty exhausted from walking around so much. She goes to bed by 10 p.m. and I stay up until 1 a.m. watching TV. 1 a.m. — I try to turn on my computer to watch one last episode before sleeping, but it's apparently broken. I freak out for a bit and message my brother, but he's not helpful and I decide to leave it for tomorrow. Daily Total: $17.90",6,194
"9:30 a.m. — My friend wakes me up and we have my usual breakfast of bread, Nutella, and orange juice. We get ready while I try to fix my computer. 12:30 p.m. — I manage to fix my computer! We decide to go to the cinema, and I have free movie tickets that my dad got from his work. Free movie! 2:30 p.m. — The movie ends and we head home. On the way, I get a baguette from the bakery ($1). We also stop at a Lebanese food restaurant to get takeout. We get two chicken shawarma and I pay ($10.70). We go home and eat while watching TV. $11.70 3:30 p.m. — I buy a train ticket to go visit my friend in South France in a couple weeks. She decides to take a nap, so I use this time to catch up on . $139.80 5:30 p.m. — We head out to go on a long walk. Around 6:30 p.m., we decide to take a break for drinks. I order two drinks and my friend covers what she owed me from lunch. I pay for the rest and we walk back home. $8.50 8 p.m. — We get home. For dinner, I decide to try a new salmon recipe. I've never cooked salmon before, so I'm a bit scared of how it will turn out, but I glaze it with garlic, honey and lemon and it tastes amazing! 10:15 p.m. — My parents are going skiing next weekend, so I decide to buy a train ticket to go with them. I go to bed and watch some TV until 12 a.m. $58.60 Daily Total: $218.60",7,194
"11:30 a.m. — Back-to-back Pilates & Cardio Sculpt at my gym, my usual Saturday lineup. Meet the fiancé after class to run errands. Head to Starbucks and am sold on a new latte there, even though the price makes me cringe. I only buy coffee on the weekends, so I tell myself it's okay. $5.87 2 p.m. — We head to Bloomingdale's, and I return some things I bought (I tend to over-shop, especially when I have special occasions to shop for, but I am very good at returning what I don't end up wearing). I get $210 back on my card. 2:30 p.m. — We're recently engaged, but the ring is too big. Head to a nearby jeweler for a ring guard for the time being. We are starving and head to a nearby diner. I get avocado toast with sunny side up eggs, bacon, and home fries. Fiancé treats. 5 p.m. — I am going to Denver over Memorial Day Weekend for my friend's bachelorette party. I remember to Venmo her for my portion of the house rental. $285 8:30 p.m. — One of our friends is having a party tonight, so we head to a restaurant nearby with two other couples. The men treat. We head to a liquor store later and the girls take care of the vodka and chasers for the pregame. $12 2 a.m. — I'm drunk and I want pizza. $3 Daily Total: $305.87",1,195
"11 a.m. — I wake up not as hungover as I thought. (Thank you, pizza!) I get ready quickly to make an 11:15 Booty Blast class. After class I head to Zara to return a few items I bought online that don't fit right. They're having a great sale I end up buying a $20 dress against the return and still get $55 back. I promised myself I wouldn't buy any clothes in January, but this is kind of free, right? I meet the fiancé and his family for lunch/brunch. Feel kind of gross in my gym clothes, but this was also unplanned. They treat. 1 p.m. — I head to Whole Foods and shop for this week's dinners and lunches. I plan on making dinner for three nights and lunch for three days. I use a coupon on the website for $5 off $20 of produce. I buy kale, peppers, potatoes, spinach, tomatoes, canned tomatoes, avocados (four for $5!), feta, chicken breasts, and cod. (It's on sale!) $48 7 p.m. — After spending the last three hours cooking and prepping for the week I head to a Barre class. 8:30 p.m. — Tonight's dinner is lemon-baked cod with spinach and feta orzo. Made a little too much, but throw it out because leftover fish seems fishy to me. Daily Total: $48",2,195
"9:30 a.m. — So happy I bought all those avocados this weekend. Make myself a coffee and have 1/2 a mashed avocado on two slices of gluten-free bread, courtesy of the communal kitchen at work. 12:30 p.m. — Package and mail a return for two shirts I bought the fiancé that he didn't want. Lunch is a salad I made from yesterday's Whole Foods shop — kale with grilled chicken, feta, 1/2 an avocado, 1/2 a hard-boiled egg, and tomatoes with olive oil dressing. 3 p.m. — Snack on chocolate from a coworker. My coworkers ALWAYS have chocolate, which can be a great thing or a terrible thing… 6:30 p.m. — Barre Burn at my gym. I love this class. 7:30 p.m. — Tonight is night!! I pick up a bottle of my favorite wine on my way home. I cook a very easy dinner of peppers, potatoes, and baked chicken. This one's a hit with my fiancé and there are even enough leftovers for his lunch tomorrow. I spend the rest of the night watching with him, drinking wine, and snacking on chocolate. $14 Daily Total: $14",3,195
"9:30 a.m. — Breakfast is the same as yesterday. So is lunch. 1:15 p.m. — Take a Barre Burn class at my gym during lunch. Working out during lunch is something I can't do very often, so I'm especially pumped today. 5 p.m. — I have a feeling it's going to be a late night. I take a break to check my personal emails and see that Bloomingdale's is having a one-day-only sale on shoes. I have a wedding in February and have been wanting silver heels to go with my dress. I buy five pairs. (I plan to only keep one, I just want options!) I snack on some free chocolate. $299.00 7:45 p.m. — Rush out of work to make an 8:15 p.m. gym class. I've never taken this class before, but it was the only one available at this time by my apartment. The class was amazing. Happy I went and even happier I prepped dinners this Sunday. Dinner tonight is spaghetti squash with tomatoes, basil, Parmesan, and spinach. Daily Total: $299.00",4,195
"9:30 a.m. — Breakfast is coffee and avocado toast again, but this time with a whole avocado and a hard boiled egg from home to make it more fun. 2 p.m. — Work gives us $20 a week to use on Seamless. I brought another salad with me today, but am starting to feel a little bored, so use part of my credit on a (different) salad from Chop't. We have a meeting and there's Baked By Melissa cupcakes! Those are my weakness. I take three! 7 p.m. — It's looking like a late night. I take two handfuls of M&Ms from the communal M&M dispenser. 8:30 p.m. — FINALLY out of work! Too tired to work out, but too stressed to go straight home. Head to the steam room at my gym for 30 minutes. We're having a couple over for dinner Friday, so I prep what I can in advance from the Fresh Direct order my fiancé placed. He covered this order, since I paid for Whole Foods Sunday. My dinner ends up being two mini bags of popcorn that I eat at 10:30 while watching TV. Daily Total: $0",5,195
"9:30 a.m. — I finish the last of my four avocados on gluten free toast and coffee provided by work. 1:30 p.m. — My lunch is the same salad from Monday and Tuesday. I eat quickly then head to my weekly therapy appointment. $40 2:45 — I pass my eyebrow place on the way back and notice there's no wait. I stop in before heading back to work to get my eyebrows and lips threaded. I can't believe I let them get so bad. $15 4 p.m. — My friend is finalizing her bachelorette party and needs my help to book a room. I pay $1,828 upfront for 1 of the rooms. My actual portion is $502. I hope to get the remainder from other girls for what I spotted before having to pay my credit card bill. $1,828 6:15 p.m. — I get out of work and have some time to kill before a secret Santa dinner with some of my best girl friends. It's actually January, but having this in December has always proven to be hard. I get a manicure. $17 7:45 p.m. — I make it to the restaurant with two gifts in tow, one for my secret Santa, the other for a friend's sister who just had a baby (both bought last week). Dinner was great! $74 10:30 — Split a cab home with two friends and Venmo my portion. During the weekend I try to walk most places, and I use my prepaid transit card to get to work via subway, but sometimes the temptation is too much . $5 Daily Total: $1,979.00",6,195
"9:30 a.m. — Breakfast is coffee and a protein bar from my communal kitchen because, sadly, I've reached the end of my avocado stash. 12:30 p.m. — So happy I still have some Seamless money left! I get a two sushi roll lunch special and pay the rest of the balance $1.67 5:30 — I rush out of work to make it to Pilates. I missed the gym two days in a row and don't want to miss it again tonight. I make it just in time for a quick class before tonight's festivities. 6:45 p.m. — I stop at the grocery store on my way home to pick up some last minute items for tonight's dinner. We're making fajitas and I don't think we have enough tomatoes or cheese. I also pick up juices and sodas to mix with tequila. I found an amazing recipe for this grapefruit lime tequila drink and can't wait to try it. I suspect my fiancé will Venmo me for half. $24.17 8:30 p.m. — Friends come over for dinner. We have homemade fajitas and tequila. Happy Friday! Daily Total: $25.84",7,195
"7 a.m. — It's Friday! I drink a cup of coffee with half and half and peruse the internet before work. I usually don't eat breakfast, and today is no different. 12 p.m. — I usually bring my lunch to work, but I'm pretty much out of everything, so I head to Trader Joe's on my lunch break. I grab frozen enchiladas for my lunch and pick up some groceries while I'm at it. I buy avocados, onions, broccoli slaw, sunflower seeds, eggplant hummus, a frozen pizza, and a bag of split red lentils. $21.21 12:30 p.m. — Back at the office, I heat up my enchiladas and also snack on some chips and salsa from yesterday's catered lunch. 6 p.m. — I get home from work, and I'm famished. I quickly throw together gluten-free chicken nuggets, a few slices of cheddar cheese, some corn and flax chips, and some hummus. I wolf it all down while watching on HBO GO. I also polish off the bottle of wine a date brought over earlier this week. 8:30 p.m. — I browse the Target website. I am in need of a bedside lamp. There's a nice one for $29.99, but I decide I'll go look in the store this weekend and save on shipping. I'm also really good at delaying purchases, so it may be another three months before I finally break down and buy a lamp. 10 p.m. — Sleep. Daily Total: $21.21",1,196
"7 a.m. — Why am I awake this early? Might as well be productive. I call the mail-order prescription service that my health insurance insists I use. I'll take it — free birth control is free birth control. But last month they sent a 90-day supply to my very old address. I spend 30 minutes on the phone with them, but we finally get it sorted and they are going to expedite my 90-day supply. Thank goodness, because I can feel PMS coming on already! 8 a.m. — Why did I make that call without any coffee in my system? I make coffee in my Chemex and then pour it over half and half and whisk it with my immersion blender to make something akin to a latte. It's delicious. 9:30 a.m. — I head out to pick up my friend and her cousin for yoga at a local brewery. We arrive at the brewery and find out that we were supposed to register ahead of time, and the class is sold out. I don't like to pre-register for things and commit my money (even if it's only $15) to an event I may decide not to attend, so I'm okay with getting rejected at the door. 11 a.m. — We take our yoga fail as a sign to start eating and drinking. We stop to pick up my friend's roommate and then head to a local upscale BBQ place that I've never tried before. I order pulled pork eggs Benedict and have two mimosas. We each pay for our own meals. The drinks have me feeling generous so I tip a little over 20%. $31.84 1 p.m. — We decide to continue day-drinking. My friend and I go to the grocery store for supplies to make mimosas and palomas, and the roommate and cousin go to the liquor store for the tequila and champagne (Texas blue laws... you can't buy liquor at the grocery store). I buy the groceries and my friend promises to Venmo me later. $21.15 2 p.m. — Back at my friend's house, we drink, I lead some yoga, and we smoke some weed that my friend's roommate graciously provides. 2:30 p.m. — Somehow the topic of a lamp comes up. My friend has an extra lamp she wants to give me! Thank you, gods of the unwanted lamp! So glad I didn't drop $30 last night on Target.com. 4:30 p.m. — My sister and her boyfriend are in town so I meet up with them at a local pub. I snack on her cheese fries and order a Lonestar Beer. Sis' boyfriend pays. 5:45 p.m. — More drinking. Sis' boyfriend buys champagne and Red Bull and I pick up a six-pack of beer at the 7-Eleven. $10.27 9:30 p.m. — Sis and her boyfriend leave. I set my timer for an hour long nap. I'm supposed to meet up with my friends later but I'm sleepy. 10:30 p.m. — My friend texts ""We'll be in Deep Ellum in 10."" I am already very asleep and so I miss the text. Daily Total: $63.26",2,196
"8:30 a.m. — Wake up and spend way too much time on Facebook before getting out of bed. I finally get up and make a homemade latte with some cocoa powder whisked in. 10 a.m. — Grocery store run number two. This time I go to Central Market for off-brand grapefruit fizzy water, a head of lettuce, ginger, soy sauce, unsalted roasted cashews, organic half and half, a frozen Amy's Indian meal, Siggi's whole milk plain yogurt, and some flowers for my aunt who invited me to dinner tonight. These groceries will probably last me about two weeks. Next weekend I may go to Aldi or Whole Foods for items I can't get at TJ's or Central Market. $26.82 10:45 a.m. — I also get gas while I'm out. I still have half a tank, but I like to fill up every weekend. $10.74 12 p.m. — I make some salad dressing based on one at my favorite vegetarian restaurant using the cashews, soy sauce, and some vegetable oil. I eat it over broccoli slaw and some sunflower seeds from my TJ's haul. 1:30 p.m. — I cook some Khichdi, an Indian lentil porridge, using some groceries from a previous week. It turns out delicious and it'll make a great lunch throughout the week. 2:30 p.m. — I've been wanting to buy undies, but I'm really cheap, and when I buy them from Target they fall apart. I usually end up going to Marshall's or TJ Maxx, but those stores can be hit or miss. On top of that, I don't really want to spend a bunch of time trying to find acceptably cute undies. I solve this problem by signing up for a BootayBag subscription. It's $12/month for two pairs of undies. I hope this saves me time and energy and improves my underwear drawer! $12 3 p.m. — I'm inspired to clean out my underwear drawer and toss all the ratty pairs. I also hand wash some clothes. 3:30 p.m. — I cook the Trader Joe's frozen pizza and eat half of it. 6:30 p.m. — Dinner at my aunt and uncle's house includes steak, baked potatoes, salad, and two glasses of red wine. We talk about current events and how we hope my teenage cousins' generation will be stirred to change things when their time comes. 9:30 p.m. — Back home I get on Facebook and see that one of my favorite artists is playing in Dallas next month. I've never seen him perform live. I immediately look up tickets and purchase two when I see that it won't put me out too much. $98 Daily Total: $147.56",3,196
"7:30 a.m. — Coffee is the nectar of the gods. I drink some and then head out for work. 9:30 a.m. — It's freezing in my office. I make some tea from the stash I keep at my desk. 10:30 a.m. — I eat my hard-boiled egg with some hot sauce I brought from home. It seems to only make me hungrier, so I also eat a few tortilla chips left over from a catered lunch last week. 12:30 p.m. — Lunch is khichdi with a swirl of whole milk plain yogurt that I brought in a separate container. My coworkers and I watch videos on YouTube while we eat. 4 p.m. — I am working from home this afternoon and I snack on half an avocado with some Crackers. 6:30 p.m. — Dinner is a salad made with lettuce and broccoli slaw and topped with homemade cashew tamari dressing. I also drink a beer from my 7-Eleven run this weekend. 10 p.m. — After reading for a bit, I'm off to sleep. Daily Total: $0",4,196
"7:30 a.m. — Homemade latte and lounging around the house before work. I pack my lunch of Khichdi, yogurt, and a hard-boiled egg in case I want a snack. 10:15 a.m. — I look down and my fingernails are blue because I'm so cold. Time for more tea from my stash. I drink the last one and set a reminder for myself to bring more from home. I have an unhealthy habit of collecting tea, and I probably don't need to buy any more for the next year. 10:45 a.m. — Hard-boiled egg and some more leftover chips. They're starting to get stale, but I love tortilla chips so much that I don't mind. 12:30 p.m. — Time for lunch. I eat the khichdi and yogurt that I packed. 5 p.m. — Practically no one is at the office, so I head out earlier than usual. When I get home I see that my birth control has arrived! It's in a giant box with a styrofoam cooler inside and two ice packs. I stash the styrofoam thing in my closet and pop the ice packs in the freezer. It may be cold outside now, but I can see myself using them to keep beers and fizzy waters cold this summer. 6:30 p.m. — I am craving something warm, so I make curried sweet potato soup using coconut milk and some sweet potatoes I had. I eat it with some avocado and a quesadilla made with tortillas and cheese that I also had already. I drink a grapefruit fizzy water. 7:30 p.m. — My scalp has been really irritated lately, and my avocados are ripening faster than I can eat them, so I decide to do an avocado scalp treatment. I mash up an avocado and massage it into my scalp. Then I put on a shower cap and let it sit for about 30 min. I also decide to do a clay face mask. Afterward I spend way too long washing bits of avocado out of my hair. It's worth it though; my hair is super soft and my scalp feels great. 9 p.m. — Sleep. Daily Total: $0",5,196
"6 a.m. — I wake up early because I have a dentist appointment this morning and I want to have time to drink coffee before I go. I pack my lunch and an extra mug of coffee before I head out. 8:30 a.m. — Thank goodness there's no charge for the dentist appointment — my insurance covers it. The appointment didn't take very long and my calendar at work is blocked off until 10 a.m. I'm tempted to do something else for an hour, but the weather is crappy and I really do not need to buy anything, so there's no sense in stopping for a coffee or perusing Trader Joe's. I head to work but take a longer route to kill a little time. 9 a.m. — It's 58 degrees in our office this morning. I silently thank the coffee gods for my second mug of coffee. I reheat it and sip while catching up on emails. 10 a.m. — Eat my hard boiled egg with some hot sauce I brought from home. 11 a.m. — I refill my tea stash with a bag of teas I brought from home. They include: ginger, green, rooibos chai, chamomile and a ""daily detox"" blend. I make a mug of the detox tea. 12:30 p.m. — Lunch is khichdi and then table tennis with my coworkers. 4 p.m. — I'm starving, so I make some popcorn from the office stash and share it with my coworkers. I top mine with some of the hot sauce I brought for my hard-boiled egg this morning. Yum. 6:30 p.m. — Get home and whip up some cashew soy sauce dressing and eat it over lettuce and broccoli slaw. I also pop open a beer and sit down to watch some videos that my therapist asked me to see before my appointment tomorrow. 7 p.m. — I'm inspired by creating my money diary and create a spreadsheet to track my spending all year long. 9:30 p.m. — Sleep. Daily Total: $0",6,196
"7:30 a.m. — How is it only Thursday?! I drink two cups of coffee with half and half and cocoa powder whisked in. 10 a.m. — I didn't bring a hard boiled egg today because I'm out and I forgot to make more. W . No breakfast. 11:30 a.m. — My period is coming any minute now, and I can feel my appetite increasing exponentially. I place an order online for lunch — two barbacoa tacos, chips, queso and an iced tea. I normally always eat my packed lunch on weekdays, but when it's that time of the month, all the rules go out the window. I set the pickup time for noon. $14.60 12:30 p.m. — Back at the office after eating most of the chips in the car — oops. I eat one of the tacos and save the second one for dinner. I share the chips and queso with my coworkers. 6:30 p.m. — I stay at work a little later than usual since it's closer to go straight to my therapist's from work. I eat my second taco at my desk before heading out. 7 p.m. — Therapy. I have a great therapist. Insurance pays for the session via the Employee Assistance Program. I found out today that only three sessions are covered (today was my second) and I'll have to pay $80/session after that... I will have to look at my budget to decide if I want to allocate my money that way right now. 8:30 p.m. — I get home and work on my blog. I've started this side project to hopefully bring in a little extra money, but the past week I've been really lazy about it. As per my sister's advice, I create a timeline of goals and deadlines to get myself back on track. 9:30 p.m. — Sleep. Tomorrow is Friday! Daily Total: $14.60",7,196
"9 a.m. — Up and at home! Today is a three day weekend, so no work! I check my emails and see two new housing lotteries open. I qualify for one, so I apply. Rent in NYC continues to go up while my income doesn't. I have been applying for all of the affordable housing I can. 10 a.m. — I have a yoga class at 11, but my stomach is not agreeing with me today. I hop in the shower and get dressed, but end up back in bed. I don't lose any money because this was a “by donation” class and you pay what you want when you check in. I text my boyfriend asking for Gatorade. 2 p.m. — My boyfriend arrives and he wakes me up. He got Vitamin Water instead of Gatorade. Not the same, but I take a Tylenol and lay back down. 3:45 p.m. — I'm hungry and so is he. We decide to try a new burrito spot on Seamless. He gets two of their specials and I get a spicy chicken burrito. Once the food arrives, we eat and fall asleep. My boyfriend works nights so afternoons are normally when he sleeps. I treat. $27.53 9 p.m. — We wake up and I watch some TV. I feel better. He has to leave at 10, so he gets ready to go while I wash a small load (we have a washer/dryer in our place!) and heat up my food. He leaves and I window shop online. 11 p.m. — I purchase two sweaters and some socks from Express with a gift card my mom sent me for Christmas. It was a $100 card, but I only spent $55.07 on my purchase. After this I hop into bed because I have to be up at 6:20 a.m. Daily Total: $27.53",1,197
"6:30 a.m. — Up for work and I feel off. I drink a big cup of orange juice and take an extra strength Tylenol. 9 a.m. — I stop by Starbucks to grab my free birthday item. I get a ham, egg, and cheese sandwich. I drink a bottle of water I have at work with it. 11 a.m. — Drink a Pepsi a coworker gave me last week. I didn't drink coffee this morning, so I'm feeling sluggish. I'm actually busy today, but, thankfully, this is my only day at work this week. Tomorrow is my birthday and I'm going to Vegas the day after. YAY FOR ME! 3 p.m. — I finally get to grab lunch. I go to Subway and get a meal. I eat out a lot — it's a terrible habit that I'm trying to cut back on, but for now, fast food is what it is. $7.62 4 p.m. — Get a call about a job I applied to over a year ago. They want to know if I'm still interested. The job pays twice as much as I make but it's only 21 hours a week so my pay will end up being the same. I have to reapply, so she emails me the info. The job is also walking distance from my house. I definitely make a mental note that I need to weigh the pros and cons if selected. 7 p.m. — I am home and off the rest of the week! My boyfriend makes bratwurst for dinner before he leaves for work. I eat one and have some soda. Once he leaves, I finish packing for Thursday and watch T.V. Daily Total: $7.62",2,197
"9:30 a.m. — It's my birthday! I go to the grocery store to pick up some snacks and other items. It's my week to pay for groceries even though it's my birthday. Since I won't be home, we only get half the groceries we need. $48.08 12:30 p.m. — I really want a peanut butter and jelly, so I make one for myself. My boyfriend took the night off because it's my birthday. We hang out, watch TV, and smoke a little. I remind myself that this week will be my last week smoking weed until I get a new job. 8 p.m. — Lay around the house while my boyfriend cooks my birthday meal. He makes me a steak, asparagus, mashed potatoes, and mac 'n' cheese. We have red wine with our meal and eat by candle light. Money is a little tight, so I appreciate that he cooked for me. He also has taken off of work so we can spend some quality time all night. Daily Total: $48.08",3,197
"4 a.m. — I didn't sleep well (or at all). I get up, shower, and call a cab to the airport. I learned long time ago that taking a cab or Uber to the airport is much more relaxing than taking public transportation, so I make it a point to include cab fare in my travel budget.

They are ""on sale"" for 50% off. I quickly Google the pair and find them for $400. So the sale price isn't really 50% off, more like 40% but I still purchase them because my stepdad had sent me $500 for my trip.

I pay for the crab legs. $35 1 p.m. — We sit in a sports bar and watch the game. I wanted to bet on the Packers but I am so glad I didn't. They are losing horribly.

I hear good things about their Mineralize Timecheck Lotion. I also dip quickly inside Victoria's Secret to see if they have my favorite bralette in stock. (They don't.) $49 4 p.m. — I get a little hungry, so I eat some canned pineapples. To be fair, my boyfriend and I eat real pineapples when they're in season. Also: have you ever rubbed a piece of pineapple on your nose to clear up blackheads? No? Thank me later! 4:30 p.m. — My skin has been terribly dry and flakey lately with the added Tretinoin gel I've been using. There's only one superhero that I've ever come across to help with dry, flakey skin: SQUALANE. Amazon Prime that shit for next-day delivery! $15 5 p.m. — I put a pot of rice on, and I head over to the climbing gym and put in work. 8 p.m. — Go to the Korean market and purchase yellow onion, green onion, more kimchi, natto, pickled plums, enoki mushrooms, and dumplings. This'll be dinner's supplemental ingredients for the next week. I also get $10 in quarters for laundry this weekend. $29 9 p.m. — I put on Netflix while I wait for the kimchi stew to simmer. I use ripe and new kimchi, leftover onion from my last bulb, leftover sausage, tuna, sesame oil, red pepper paste, crushed red pepper, enoki mushrooms, and green onion.

So stoked. 12 p.m. — I have an interview this afternoon, so I re-do my skincare routine and eat lunch while I let my skincare sink in before makeup application.

What awesome people. Had a great interview with three very chill people — wish me luck, y'all! 4 p.m. — My essence and eye cream came in the mail from Sephora. So. Happy. I spend of all my disposable income on skincare products, can you tell? It's not even my industry! 4:30 p.m. — Email the recruiter to say what up, thanks, you guys are great, hope I hear something good soon, . I'm like, in a really good mood. 5 p.m. — I have plans tonight so I take some time to wash the dishes and tidy up the apartment before I come home drunk to a huge mess. (I hate that feeling...) 6 p.m. — Meeting up with some friends for dinner tonight to catch up and see their new house! We decide to grill some meat for the occasion, so I'm headed back to the Korean market for some pork belly, lettuce, eggs, Korean soda, and six bottles of soju. I'll be bringing rice and a bottle of red wine just in case they don't have any. (They're bachelors, I love calling them ""the delinquents."") It's $56 but they Venmo me $30 each. I Venmo them $10 back each. $16 7:30 p.m. — It's a feast! We have too much meat, and we finish four bottles of soju plus some wine and beer. We cook pork belly, thick cut pork belly, pork jowl, wrapped in lettuce with some fermented soy paste, garlic boiled in sesame oil, kimchi, steamed egg casserole, purple rice, raw bell pepper dipped in red pepper paste, vinegar, and Xxtra Flamin' Hot Cheetos to snack.

"9:30 a.m. — My friend's little sister and friend are interviewing me for a project. I get up and put a pot of coffee on while I wash up and tidy up the apartment before they come over.

I hope I get the job! 10:30 a.m. — I get an email from the recruiter with a writing test attached. I've got two days to turn it in. Piece of cake! 11 a.m. — I meet my friend and her friend outside while I smoke a cigarette. I'm exhausted. Inside, I toast some baguette slices with butter and lay out some cheese and prosciutto for them to nibble during the interview. 1 p.m. — Interview/filming's all done and my friend returns two out of four poetry books I lent her from a few months ago. I lend her some new poetry books and a few works of fiction before she leaves. 1:30 p.m. — Time for my lunch! I eat some yogurt with honey and granola, eat the other half of my avocado, have a few bites of cheddar cheese, and toast some buttered baguette and prosciutto for myself (I am obviously no stranger to repeat meals for days on end). My fridge is beginning to reek of kimchi from the stew so I know what I'll be trying to finish tonight! 3:00 p.m. — I hit a midday hangover (very rare) and go chug lots of water. AND I just remember that it's payday! I log into my bank account and subtract my savings ($196 per week) from my take-home and then transfer 20% of that into my boyfriend and my joint account. 3:30 p.m. — My boyfriend flew back to his hometown of Chicago earlier this week and it turns out he'll be there for a while. Since I'm still freelance, I book myself a one-way ticket this Sunday. We'll book our return flight tickets in probably two weeks, but it's uncertain for now. We use the joint account to pay for the fare. $118 4 p.m. — I decide that no work is being done in a timely matter until this hangover it gone. I check myself into bed with Netflix and a big glass of water and set an alarm for 8 p.m. to finish my work for the day. It's Friday, and no one's doing anything with my assignment until Monday anyway. Also, there is no way in hell I'm making it to the climbing gym tonight. Soju is a killer. 6:30 p.m. — I heat up some rice and kimchi stew and eat in front of some . Also, I get my tax refund back! I do my taxes the moment I get all my paperwork in. I had back taxes from years ago when I was freelancing and got $2,000 taken away. I only receive about $280 back, but this at least makes up for my skincare shopping the other day! 8 p.m. — The alarm goes off. I ignore it. 10 p.m. — Tomorrow's going to be a long day. I try to sleep early, so naturally I pour myself some cava with pineapple juice, get the munchies, fry a few dumplings, and chat on the phone with my boyfriend. I don't sleep well without my boyfriend so I end up going to bed at 4 a.m. Daily Total: $118",3,201

I take a Lyft line and meet some people already in the car that are headed to the same place! $7 11 p.m. — I order a shot of Jameson for the birthday boy and a Jameson ginger for myself. I tip $6 'cause it's super crowded and I got service pretty quickly. I always overtip the first round in the hopes that they'll remember me and get me quick for the following rounds. It works 75% of the time. $24 12 a.m. — We leave the bar and go to a friend's place for the rest of the night. They have a handle of Jameson there and a case of beer. I sip on a beer for the rest of the night.

I call my boyfriend to let him know I haven't overslept and put on a pot of coffee while I get ready. 9:30 a.m. — Everything's already packed and ready to go, but I realize I haven't done the dishes yet! I load everything into the dishwasher to save some time and schedule a Lyft to pick me up. 10:15 a.m. — I smoke a cigarette outside while I wait for my scheduled Lyft to arrive. Driver's super nice and asks if he needs to be speeding if I'm late to the airport. I'm giving myself a lot of time so I decline and dip in and out of sleep for the rest of the ride. I leave a $5 tip. $30 11:30 a.m. — TSA line is a breeze (there's nobody here!) and I find a grilled cheese truck inside LAX. I grab a cheddar cheese grill, a tomato soup, and a bottle of water. $14 1 p.m. — Boarding! I took the last seat on the flight, so I'm in a middle seat between two strangers. The airplane has screens for every seat and free movies. I watch and re-watch while sometimes falling asleep. 7:30 p.m. — The flight is 4 hours to Chicago, but they're 2 hours ahead and I land at 7:30 p.m. My boyfriend picks me up, and we go straight to his cousin's place in Wicker Park, where we'll be crashing. 8:30 p.m. — His cousin and fiancé brought back some empanadas from earlier that day (I'm so hungry at this point). We nibble on the couch while watching T.V. 9 p.m. — Our hosts have also cooked dinner (pesto chicken with feta and spinach). My boyfriend and I share a plate since we're not too hungry anymore.

I got an email reply from a company I applied to the other week asking for some more information about my work experience. Yay!

I follow up with the recruiter to make sure that she received it. 2 p.m. — My boyfriend and I get a little hungry so we nibble on a salmon his mother [made] and some homemade papaya salad. I then I go back to re-budgeting my spreadsheet. (I have a sheet with ""goal"" spending amounts and savings and expenses and what not, for every month until the end of the year. I decide I'm going to start paying off my student loans while they're deferred so some rows need to be moved around!) 4:30 p.m. — I finish some reading for school and my boyfriend and I go on a walk through the nature preserve behind his parents' neighborhood. The last time we came in November and it was just too cold to be outside. It's still very cold but at least the sun's out. 6 p.m. — We have Korean BBQ with my boyfriend's family. It's his nephew's 24th birthday. We order three huge mains of meat, three appetizers, and some soju and beer. There's eight of us and we're stuffed. Had to pack up some food.

I look into a new shower curtain for our bathroom and we go to bed by midnight. It's been a low-key Valentine's Day but we don't really celebrate V-day!

Our boss works remote a few states away and is in town for the week. We go to a local cafe and I get a turkey bacon wrap with chips.

We order $45 worth of food, but the boyfriend and I got a gift card for this bar for Christmas so everything is covered by it. He gets a few beers, and I stick to water. We also order cheese curds. 7:30 p.m. — We get home and I work on a couple of songs with the new keyboard. Very happy about this purchase even though it's out of the ordinary and pretty expensive. 10 p.m. — I spend the rest of the night working on songs and then researching cameras for my upcoming vacations.

Scoop some almond butter out and eat this for breakfast. 9:45 a.m. — I find out from a friend that if you purchase something from Lady Gaga's shop, you get a pre-sale code. I buy a $12 patch, but after shipping it increases to $17. I use the code only to find out the cheapest ones left are $200. Looks like I'll be one of the regulars buying tickets next week. $17 12:00 p.m. — Run out to the bank over lunch to grab $60 for my coworker from the keyboard I bought. Once back at the office, I make a sandwich with items brought from home. $60 2:30 p.m. — I call my insurance company to dispute a bill I got this month for a birth control insert from November. I ended up getting a bill because the doctor's office coded it wrong. I end up on a three way call with my insurance and the provider only to find out the provider won't change it.

We decided earlier in the week to hit up this new cookie dough place. 3 p.m. — My friend is running late, so I stop into Sephora. I need more foundation and my mascara has been clumping lately.

Instead, I drink the free coffee they provide and grab a bagel from the office kitchen. One of the best perks of this job has to be the free breakfast. 12 p.m. — It's typical for a production to pay for your lunches up to a certain amount. We get $14 per lunch, which is pretty standard for our industry. Our department decides on Sweetgreen, and I go pick it up. On the way there one of my coworkers asks for me to pick her up a coconut water and a water since she's been battling food poisoning. I'm glad to do it since I can turn the receipt into production later and get reimbursed. 6 p.m. — I still have a few hours till I can get out of here. I decide to go up to the kitchen to see what snacks production has stocked the pantry with. They don't have much to choose from, so I settle on a granola bar. 8:30 p.m. — Finally time to leave.

I'll turn the receipt in at the end of the week to get reimbursed. 8:50 a.m. — I have time for Starbucks this morning so I go for it. My drink order is always the same: grande Americano with a pump of vanilla.

I clean the apartment before she gets in. 5 p.m. — I finish up a couple of emails and snack on pita chips. My friend arrives and we decide to treat ourselves to a little 'spree at Aritzia.

I use a gift card to help with the damage. $103 6:30 p.m. — We run to Whole Foods on the way back to my apartment and pick up wine, cheese, crackers, and grapes. I pay for the wine, she buys the eats. $13.05 8 p.m. — We finish the bottle of wine and meet our other friend at a taco place in Nolita.

Everything is delicious and the check isn't as scary as I thought it would be. $30.90 11 p.m. — We stop by a friend's birthday party at a bar in the Lower East Side. It's good to show face and mingle with people I haven't seen in a few months. My friend and I order vodka sodas at the bar. $8.50 12:30 a.m. — The alcohol isn't making my allergies/cold any better, so I hint to my friend that it's time to head home. Luckily, she's tired too.

(Thanks, Mom and Dad!) 5:15 p.m. — I'm hungry and the parents are paying, which is a deadly combination. I order a glass of red wine and a burger with fries.

Squats. 10:30 — I run home for a quick shower and make two pieces of PB&J toast that I eat in the car on the way to the next house showing. 11:15 a.m. — I arrive early for the showing, so I drive around the neighborhood and discover that the backyard opens up to an arroyo, which has a paved running and bike path. The bike path leads straight to the community center where my boyfriend plays hockey! 11:30 — Our realtor is out of town, so we walk through the house with the listing agent. The house is a little dingier than what was shown in the photos. The cabinets and baseboards need a fresh coat of paint and so does the deck. The listing also neglected to show that the master suite is in the basement — but it is huge and the bathroom has a giant shower, soaking tub, and sauna. There is an additional room off the master that I decide can be used as a night nursery down the road, alleviating the need to walk upstairs when we have kids. 1:30 p.m. — My boyfriend and I agree to put an offer in on the house. The listing realtor tells us that the owners purchased it for $350,000 and are looking to get out ASAP, which is why it's listed for $300,000. We agree that some work needs to be done — painting cabinets, painting deck, landscaping — but it's nothing that we can't do ourselves. 2:00 p.m. — I snack on tortilla chips and hummus while making grilled ham and cheese and the rest of the broccoli tots. After eating, I survey our fridge and make a weekly meal plan and grocery list based on what is left. 3:00 p.m. — We speak with our realtor, who starts writing up our offer. We have decided to offer the full listing price, $300,000. 4:00 p.m. — I grocery shop for the week. I'm very into Albertsons Monopoly and purposely choose products that will get us tickets. I buy the same groceries every week and try to buy organic as much as possible: O.J., yogurt, coffee beans, tortillas, bell peppers, cucumbers, mushrooms, onions, bananas, and a giant box of spinach. I also buy ingredients for beef stroganoff, my boyfriend's meal request of the week, along with a new acne wash and two boxes of Yogi teas that are on sale. Two people ahead of me in the checkout line don't play Monopoly, so I get their tickets as well! $105.56 6:00 p.m. — I make white chicken chili for dinner, along with an organic take-and-bake baguette. I also open a bottle of two-buck chuck to deglaze the pan while I'm cooking and drink a glass as well. 8:00 — The realtor emails us the terms of the offer and asks us to sign electronically.

He has just heard from realtor, and we should receive a counteroffer in a few hours. We spend the car ride home debating what the counteroffer will entail. 7:00 p.m. — The counteroffer comes in and the only changes are clarifying a few maintenance requests. The washer might be broken so they offer us a $500 credit towards a home warranty instead of replacing it. We sign, return, and are officially under contract! 7:30 p.m. — I drink a glass of two-buck chuck to celebrate while I make dinner: zoodles, red sauce, Trader Joe's eggplant cutlets, and another demi-baguette on the side. We spend the rest of the night calling our family and friends to tell them the good news! Daily Total: $0",3,206

I also execute a 60-day sell order on 65 shares of my Chevron stocks. I set the limit for $119/share, the 52-week high — totaling $7,735. This will be the bulk of my share of the house down payment. 5:20 p.m. — I'm running late to pick my boyfriend up. We battle with spotty cell service and confirm our loan application appointment for tomorrow. 6:20 p.m. — Home! We quickly feed the dogs and I make Annie's macaroni, mixing in some beef and taco seasoning. I pack our lunches for tomorrow while the macaroni is cooking. 7:00 — The Banff Film Festival is going on at the local theater. I bought the tickets last month as a Valentine's Day gift. We decide to skip the second half of the films after the 9 p.m. intermission and head home since it's past our bedtime. Daily Total: $4",4,206

I'm a full-time PhD student but am only taking one class this semester, which luckily counts as work to my boss. I eat my lunch — tuna packet mixed with mayo, crackers, cucumbers, and celery—while on the call. 3:00 p.m. — I receive a $10 reimbursement check from work for two lunches that I was able to claim while I was at a software training in Albuquerque last week.

I submit my time each week and have cost codes for each project I work on — three at the moment, plus a special cost code that will cover my day of volunteering tomorrow. 5:15 p.m. — I leave work early to meet with our mortgage officer. Her office is located downtown so I pay $2 for meter parking. She pulls our credit and I'm pleasantly surprised to see my score has gone up more: the median one is 753. My boyfriend and I give her all of our financial accounts and statements from the past two years.

We meet him at his hotel for a drink before dinner. $24 8:00 p.m. — We get dinner at Cafe Pasqual's, a restaurant that I've never seen without a line out the door. We share three appetizers, a smoked trout salad, melted brie with crackers, and a papusa. Boyfriend and I share a hearts of romaine salad and chicken paillard and each get a glass of wine.

I'm leading a team of 10 middle school girls through a day of STEM programs. Work offers 36 hours a year of science outreach community service, so I'm taking advantage of it. 12:00 p.m. — I eat a veggie burrito lunch provided by the conference and then run next door to the title company where I drop off our earnest money check. That's $5,000 out of my boyfriend's account since he has more liquid cash at the moment. 3:00 p.m. — After the conference, I walk home and meet Carl. We walk the dogs to a cigar store where he buys two cigars, and then we go to Whole Foods where I buy a ginger kombucha, vitamin D, and powdered collagen. $22 4:00 p.m. — Carl smokes his cigar on our patio while I drink a kombucha Moscow Mule.

We ended up leaving a bar  at 4 a.m. with pizza and giant water bottles. Honestly, I'm scared to check my credit card bill, so I don't. Maturity! 1 p.m. — It is the most beautiful beach day. We decide to grab lunch after baking in the sun and chugging water. We eat at my friend's beach club; she puts our fish tacos and calamari on her family's tab at the club. 5 p.m. — Unfortunately, we have to leave and the Sunday scaries are setting in. We hop on the ferry to get back to Long Island, and take the LIRR from Bay Shore back to Manhattan. When we get to Penn Station, we run to the subway back to his apartment.

I've been in meetings all morning and had a handful of almonds and pretzels for a midmorning snack. I decide to venture outside to pick up a Sweetgreen salad for lunch. I love the kale Caesar but I get it without tomatoes. $10.65 7 p.m. — I sprint out of work because I forgot that I signed up for a SoulCycle class.

I also grab a latte from Le Pain Quotidien. $4.63 8:30 a.m. — I take a Via to my job interview because I have to dial into a conference call for my current job while I'm commuting, and I don't want to lose service on the subway. I love Via. It's a little less efficient than Uber but the drivers are always so nice, and it's an affordable service that'll take you almost anywhere. $5.44 10 a.m. — The interview finishes. I think it went well, and I'm interested in the opportunity. Unfortunately, the interview is across town from my office and there aren't any good subway options.

My boyfriend has talked a lot about wanting to try yoga, so I sign us up for a Friday morning class at a studio by my apartment.

"8 a.m. — Before hopping on the subway to work, I stop into a new coffee shop by my house. I order a large café au lait, and to my horror, the price comes out to over $5. I've ordered more complicated drinks at other places that have been less expensive. I make a mental note to never come back to this place. $5.13 1 p.m. — I bring in leftover curry and pad Thai for lunch. It's delicious but is making my whole office smell a little funky, so I get a lot of glares from other people. 7 p.m. — I sprint out of work again to make my 7:30 p.m. SoulCycle class. This time, I remember to bring my own water, but I still pay for the shoe rental. After class, I hop on the subway and head home. I'm meeting three friends for drinks in a bit, so I need to shower and make myself presentable. After my shower, I sauté kale I found in our fridge and mix it with goat cheese and toasted almonds. An impromptu and edible dinner. $3 9:45 p.m. — I meet two of my three friends at the Orient Express cocktail bar. I'm not feeling great, so I get a glass of prosecco to calm my stomach a little bit. My friend picks up the tab before we migrate to another bar to meet our other friend. 10:45 p.m. — I pick up the tab for our four drinks at The Happiest Hour. I love the drinks here and it's close to where I live, so I always enjoy getting a nightcap here. I make it my mission to leave before midnight, and I find myself heading home at 11:58. Mission accomplished. $56.62 Daily Total: $64.75",4,207
"7:30 a.m. — I wake up tired again, with a sense that I spend my whole life feeling exhausted. I wonder if I should get a Fitbit sleep-tracker to analyze my sleep cycles. I put that on my to-do list before making a coffee, showering, and getting on the subway. 8 a.m. — One coffee isn't enough, so I stop by the coffee shop across from my office and get an iced latte. I also eat an RXBar and a graham cracker. $5 11 a.m. — I remember that I have a wedding to go to in two weekends, and I still have no outfit or dress for the occasion. It's a Hamptons wedding, so it'll probably be dressier. I peruse Rent the Runway and find one I actually like. $157.81 1 p.m. — I take a stroll to Whole Foods to grab my lunch. I get a turkey burger, zucchini, sweet potatoes, and a Pellegrino. $14.19 1:30 p.m. — I'm off tomorrow and going to my friend's house on Nantucket, so I run into the Sugarfina in Columbus Circle to get her parents a thank-you gift for hosting us. I decide on the bento box of alcoholic candy. $30.49 7 p.m. — I leave work and meet my parents at the roof bar at the Viceroy to get a drink. They buy my two glasses of rosé before I hop on the subway. Parents are the best. 9 p.m. — I get to Brooklyn Bowl, where I'm meeting my boyfriend and his friends to see a concert. He already got my ticket online and has a beer waiting for me when I show up. Honestly, true love. 11 p.m. — The concert was really fun but I'm exhausted, so we take the subway back to Manhattan so I can get some sleep. I'm flying to Nantucket tomorrow and need to pack anyway.

Our host's parents are throwing her brother a birthday party later on Nobadeer Beach. We go and set up camp, bringing sandwich supplies with us to make lunch. 5 p.m. — The party is getting started. I take up duty as a bartender and drink a side glass of rosé on the side. 8 p.m. — This party is incredibly fun but sun is setting in the next half hour, which means it'll end soon. I swing by the grill and get a burger. 10 p.m. — After packing up, my friends and I are exhausted and decide to call it an early night. No Chicken Box tonight. Daily Total: $2.57",7,207
"9 a.m. — I live a little more than a mile from my office, so I usually take a bus in the morning and walk home in the evening. However, I am not a morning person and decide to Uber because I am running late. I Uber more often than I care to admit, but the $6.41 price point doesn't make me feel too guilty. I run to Wawa to grab a coffee before going into my office building. I used to make coffee at home everyday, but it started to become too difficult to navigate the travel mug on crowded city buses. I forgot to pack breakfast on my way out the door, so I also get fresh fruit, bringing my breakfast total to $5.53. $11.94 12 p.m. — I have to mail in an $80 payment for a ticket I received, so I run to the post office during lunch. The self-service line is shorter, but the minimum purchase is three stamps. $1.47 is a small price to pay for not waiting in line, though. I was away for the holiday weekend and don't have any food in my house. I'll be eating out until I have a chance to shop for groceries on Saturday. I buy a Cobb salad and sparkling water from my favorite local lunch spot. I also snag a bag of free pretzels from the office kitchenette. $92.24 3 p.m. — I'm coordinating a bridal shower purchase with my friends from college. The shower isn't for a few more weeks, but I like to get something off the registry early. We settle on a big item from the registry, and a small, complementary, off-registry item. I grab free Laffy Taffys and chips from the kitchenette for an afternoon snack. $54.25 6:15 p.m. — Since it is raining out when I leave work, I take the bus home rather than walk. I use a token that I purchased with my monthly pre-tax commuter FSA. I eat takeout leftovers when I get home, and change into workout clothes. I purchased a yoga package a while ago from the studio around the corner, so I opt for a 7:30 class. I am almost deterred by a friend who wants to grab drinks, but I need the exercise. After class, I do some work, shower, and go to bed by 11:30. Daily Total: $158.43",1,208
"9 a.m. — I work out with my trainer in the morning using a pack of sessions I purchased previously. After my workout, I make a shake with PB2, a banana, and 2% milk. I respond to a few emails from my VP before getting ready, and end up running later than planned. I decide to Uber, but cancel when the driver doesn't look like he knows where he is going. I'm not up to speed on the cancelation policy, and get hit with a $5 fee. It takes two more tries to get a driver who appears more familiar with the area, and sets me back $11.28 for the surcharge and the fare. I still grab a coffee from Wawa before going into the office. Since I pay in cash, I drop the change into the charitable donation box next to the register. $13.28 1 p.m. — Our corporate cafeteria offers a salad bar special on Fridays, so I usually do that for Friday lunch. I also grab a large sparkling water and a cookie for later. $9.88 3 p.m. — I'm texting with my mom and she reminds me that I have to order a bridesmaid dress for a wedding in four weeks. The bride is letting us wear whatever we want, as long as it is black. I peruse Nordstrom and see that the dress I originally wanted is 40% off. It wasn't a purchase I planned to make today, but I have been putting it off. I bite the bullet and order. $160.50 5:30 p.m. — I make my weekly visit to the nail salon. I've been going to the same one every week for five years so everyone is super chatty and friendly. I opt for a gel manicure because I want it to last two weeks, and I also get a pedicure. Including tip (and the ATM surcharge), the services are $75. I stop in our brand new, massive Whole Foods on my walk home to get my favorite local hummus for dinner, and also grab some snacks. $92.68 7:30 p.m. — After debating going out, I pour a glass of wine and veg on the couch. I haven't been home a lot lately, so it feels good to just be here. I finally finish a book I've been trying to get through before turning the lights out at 11:30. Daily Total: $276.34",2,208
"9 a.m. — I can sleep really late, so I set an alarm for 9 and get up to make a small breakfast. I have a spin class at 10:30 at a local spin studio I've gone to for five years. I usually go to the same instructor; it is such a great workout, and I should go more frequently than I do. The class was already paid for, so I drive downtown and pay the $3 for parking, and get an iced coffee from Starbucks as my reward when I am finished. $7.05 12 p.m. — I am in a shore house part-time, and I head to New Jersey to stock up on supplies for my next trip down. I stop at the liquor store for a handle of vodka; NJ liquor store prices are far better than PA, and it sets me back $31.75. Next stop is Target to get essentials for my home in Philly, as well for the shore. I prefer to make my own meals down there rather than go out to eat. The bill is on the larger side — $150 — but I know that I am saving money in the long run. I stop by the grocery store to pick up the few remaining items I can't get from Target — chicken sausage and broccoli ($10.54). I get gas on my way out of NJ, which is another $18.50. My EZ-Pass is on my dad's account so he covers the toll for me. I make lunch at home and spend the rest of the afternoon doing chores around the house and watching reruns. $210.79 7:30 p.m. — I haven't been in Philly on a Saturday night in a while, and I'm looking forward to dinner and drinks with friends. For an unknown but lucky reason, Uber has applied a 50% discount to my account for all my rides this weekend, so I will pick up the Ubers for the night. I Uber to my friend's house for a glass of wine before dinner, then get the Uber to dinner. Dinner is delicious (noodles, corn Rangoon, and asparagus), and a couple of drinks for $53. $60.10 10 p.m. — After dinner, I Uber us back to our local bar for a few more drinks, before Ubering home. $30 Daily Total: $307.94",3,208
"11 a.m. — I don't set an alarm so I wake up pretty late, and make myself coffee and eggs with toast. My throat is sore and I have a cough — my annual summer cold has arrived. Since I did all of my chores yesterday, I can take the day to relax and recharge. I watch Netflix on the couch for most of the afternoon. 4 p.m. — It is beautiful outside and I feel incredibly lazy laying around. A friend texts and asks if I want to go to a new pizza place that just opened in our neighborhood. It has gotten great reviews, and it feels good to get out of the house. The pizza was good, but a little overhyped. Regardless, a good way to kill a few hours. $14 8 p.m. — I finally finish and lament to my cat about how hard it is to continue to be a Catholic. I call it at night at 11 p.m. Daily Total: $14",4,208
"8:30 a.m. — I set my alarm to run this morning, but accidentally set it for p.m. instead of a.m. Probably for the best since I am still not feeling great. I make a breakfast shake, pack my lunch, and am out the door at 8:30 to catch the bus. As always, I stop in Wawa for a coffee before heading to my office. $2 12:30 p.m. — I'm on a group text about an upcoming event at a local concert venue. My friend who originally paid for the tickets needs to be reimbursed, so I Venmo her $35. While I'm at it, I use Venmo to pay back another friend. She gave me cash over the weekend, and I'd rather pay her back this way than use the ATM and get hit with crazy surcharges. $135 2 p.m. — It's a slow day at work and I have a hard time concentrating on the routine tasks I have to do. I eat my lunch and all the snacks I packed, and pick up an espresso and a bag of popcorn from the kitchenette. I resist the urge to go to Starbucks for a cake pop. 5:30 p.m. — It's a nice night so I walk home. I take the longer route past all the neighborhood bars to see if I know anyone sitting outside. I used the last of the butter when I made eggs yesterday, so I stop in CVS to pick up more. I debate between yoga and a run. Since I am still coughing, I decide to run because I could be disruptive in a yoga class. It is really hot, but I listen to a podcast and push through. $4.49 8:30 p.m. — For dinner, I reheat a turkey burger and fry an egg. I fold laundry and drink a few glasses of wine while watching the and reunions. I shower before bed and am asleep before 11:30. Daily Total: $141.49",5,208
"9 a.m. — I work out with my trainer at 7 a.m., and make a shake when I get home. I quickly pack lunch and finish getting ready. I am moving slowly, so I decide to Uber to avoid being late for work. The Uber is $6.49 and my coffee is another $2. I am already over this week, but knowing I only have two days of work left before going to the shore for a long weekend gets me through. $8.49 2 p.m. — Work is going pretty quickly today, and I cross a bunch of things off my to-do list. A bonus: My dress for the wedding arrives! I ordered two different sizes and they sent the wrong dress in one of the sizes. Womp, womp. I call Nordstrom and they overnight me the correct dress for delivery the next day. 5:30 p.m. — It's hot and I have to carry the dress box home, so I opt for the bus. I try them on when I get home, and neither works. I'm grateful that Nordstrom has a free returns policy so I can send them back without penalty. 7 p.m. — My friend hosts Quizzo at a local bar and I'm tempted to go, but I still feel under the weather, and I haven't packed for the weekend. I make the responsible choice to stay home, do laundry, and pack. I also cook up some turkey sausage for my next few meals, and make turkey burgers to take with me this weekend. 9 p.m. — Laundry and packing almost done, I eat the turkey sausage I cooked earlier and finish the bottle of wine I opened Friday. I get in bed around 10:30, but my cough from the weekend isn't going away, and it keeps me from falling asleep at a reasonable time. I think I finally pass out around midnight. Daily Total: $8.49",6,208
"7:30 a.m. — I wake up feeling terrible: sore throat, cough, headache. I contemplate working from home but there is a meeting I should attend in-person, and I will also be out for the rest of the week. I move slowly, but still make a shake and grab my lunch on the way out. I opt to take the bus, even though I end up waiting almost 15 minutes for it. I stop in Wawa for coffee and to get cash for the next few days. I hate that my bank charges me a service fee, but I gladly pay for the convenience. $4 12 p.m. — My boss texts me and asks if I want to go to lunch. Even though I brought my lunch, it is good to get in face time with her, and also good to get out of the office. We go to a vegetarian takeout place, and I get a faux-fried chicken sandwich. It is delicious, but we both agree that it is definitely not healthy. I also grab a “box” of water and we eat lunch in the park around the corner. $11.99 3 p.m. — My lunch was so salty that I end up chugging water for most of the afternoon. I am starting to feel better, which is good news because I have a concert tonight. I finish the last few things I have for the week, put my out-of-office message on, and head out at 5. 6:30 p.m. — I meet my friends at a local bar before the concert. I have a beer, and my friend picks up the tab. I get the Uber to the venue. It's over in NJ, so I am not surprised it is almost $20. I add a tip since the driver will have to pay the toll on the way back. $23 7:30 p.m. — For some reason, my friend picks up the tab for the entire night. It is odd, but I get tired of trying to pay or give her money and just go with it. We drink vodka lemonades, but I probably should have opted for water. It is ridiculously hot and I can feel myself becoming dehydrated. 10:30 p.m. — After the concert is over, we walk to a nearby bar to wait out traffic. I chug a few club sodas and sip a vodka soda. My friend picks up the tab and the Uber home. Once we are back in the neighborhood, we stop in a local bar to catch up with friends. I stay much later than I intended to, but it's a good time. Drinks plus tip are $25. We stop at Wawa on the way home because I never ate dinner. Better late than never, I guess. I pick up a sandwich, chips, and a giant bottle of water. My friend picks up the last Uber home; I can't wait to eat and go to sleep! $35.66 Daily Total: $74.65",7,208
"6:45 a.m. — Wake up and make breakfast for daughter, get her dressed, and my husband takes her to school. Running late so no time for breakfast. Get to work and it is Employee Appreciation Day! Scarf down muffins and terrible coffee, and then off to morning meetings. 12:15 p.m. — Run out during lunch to pick-up a gift for MIL's 65th birthday. Get a Tory Burch bag and wallet, both on sale! Pop into a few other stores to pick up a necklace that was being repaired at Chanel (the repair was free; the necklace was three months old when it broke), and try on some loafers at Gucci. They don't have my size, so I ask the salesman to call me when they're back in stock. $248.50 1 p.m. — Stop in for my fave steak salad at my favorite wine bar, but sadly, no wine for lunch. Back to work. $45 5 p.m. — Pick up daughter from school and head home to get dinner started. I make eggplant parm and it is delicious! Hubby loves it, too. Bath time and books with the lil' one, and then she is off to bed by 8 p.m. Hubby and I tidy up the house and get ready for the next day. In bed by 10:30 p.m. Daily Total: $293.50",1,209
"6:45 a.m. — Rise and shine. Running on time today. It is my day for drop off, and the kiddo and I are out of the house by 7:45 a.m. The coffee gods shine on me because there is parking directly in front of Blue Bottle. Iced latte, please. At my desk by 9 a.m. for a marathon of meetings. $5.75 9:30 a.m. — Free breakfast again! This time, my boss orders in breakfast for our team from a local bakery, Clementine. Yum, yum. I gorge on pastries and quiche, and do not need to eat until later in the afternoon. 12:50 p.m. — Back-to-back conference calls are over and I am still not hungry. Take a few minutes to order tickets for our first trip to Disneyland. My MIL wanted all the family to go for her birthday, and this will be our daughter's first time. Very excited! $354 5:30 p.m. — About the hit the road, and the hubby calls to say that our daughter has requested ""sushi and cupcakes"" for dinner. I think this is both adorable and horrifying. Is she that spoiled already? I shake my head and head over to meet them at our favorite family-friendly sushi spot. She is getting very good at using chopsticks. Dinner is so good tonight; the fish is super fresh ($175.15). When we are done, we get a cupcake on the way out ($4.25). We are all fed, happy, and relaxed. We head home to get her in the bath and then off to bed. She is down by 8 p.m. and I am asleep by 9:30 p.m. $179.40 Daily Total: $539.15",2,209
"5:30 a.m. — Make it to the 6 a.m. Pilates class. It feels unnatural to work out when it is still dark outside. I power through, though, for the good of my abs and glutes. Class is over by 7 a.m. and I head home to get dressed and help hubby with the morning routine. He takes her to school today, so I take a little longer to get ready because the soreness is already setting in. $24 9 a.m. — So hungry this morning. Had eggs when I got back from the workout, but I am about to eat my left arm. Get to the office and head over to Coffee Bean for a latte and a croissant before I get back to work. $4.50 11:30 a.m. — Employee Appreciation continues! My boss comes into the office today and wants to take us to lunch. We have a full lunch with apps at a new Greek restaurant, and I order a chopped salad. He picks up the tab! 5 p.m. — Leave to pick up kiddo and realize we need to do a grocery run before we go home. (We generally spend $600/month on groceries.) We stop to get a quick bite at a local fast-food seafood place we like. It is always fun being able to sit and have a stress-free dinner with my daughter ($20.99). After, we head to the grocery store to pick up cleaning supplies for the housekeeper ($42.59). $63.58 8:30 p.m. — The lil' one is down for the night and I have a few minutes to work on our Thanksgiving travel. I have been watching tickets for months and I think the price is finally right. I am still shocked at how full the flights are — no first class available, but premium economy is great for this. I get three tickets, and the upgrade to premium economy is free because I have Platinum status on American. Aloha! $2,100.54 Daily Total: $2,192.62",3,209
"8 a.m. — Leave $140 on the counter for the housekeeper. Drop off my kid at school and once again there is parking in front of the coffee shop. I grab an iced latte and head to work ($4.75 + $1 tip). More conference calls, yay? $5.75 12 p.m. — Ravenous and head down for lunch. Get crappy pad Thai and eat it at my desk ($12.54). While eating, I make a call to add another day to the hotel reservation for Maui. Rates have gone up and the extra day costs me ($869), but now there is a fourth night free promotion. They will it deduct it when we check out. Get an alert than J.Crew is having a sale, so I go online and pick a few things. I will see what fits and send the rest back ($534.66). $1,416.20 5:15 p.m. — Hosting clients tonight to see ! We meet for dinner before the show and the 10 of us, hubby included, have a great meal. Off to the show. My company is a corporate sponsor, so the tickets are taken care of. We have great seats, 10 rows back from the stage. The show is incredible, but I am exhausted. ($1,050 expensed) 11:30 p.m. — We are late and the sitter is pissed. Pay her for the night and then collapse into bed. $120 Daily Total: $1,541.95",4,209
"9 a.m. — Downtown for a panel about women in corporate America. I speak on the panel, still feeling worn out from the long day yesterday. After the panel is over, I say a few hellos and head home. I am working from home today because I don't feel like trekking back across town to the office. Plus, I only have one call this afternoon and I can take it from my kitchen. $12 for parking 12:30 p.m. — Pick up birthday cake from MIL's birthday dinner tonight. She will be thrilled; it is ""sewing"" themed and super cute. I hope she likes it. $185 6 p.m. — We pack up the car and head to Anaheim for a birthday dinner, and Disney the next day. Car is electric and fully charged from the solar panels on the house. 8 p.m. — Dinner for MIL's 65th birthday is at the Grand Californian Hotel. Dinner is great, but it has been a busy week and we are all tired. My daughter is up way past her bedtime and is fading fast. After the cake arrives, she and I jet back to the hotel, check in, and get to bed. It is going to be a big day tomorrow. $585.15 Daily Total: $782.15",5,209
"8 a.m. — We are up and ready to go! We stop at Starbucks to make sure we are properly caffeinated for the day. The line is eternally long, and the espresso tastes burnt. Gross — but I drink it anyway. Caffeine is going to be very important today. $7.50 10:30 a.m. — Pitstop for more coffee, a caramel apple (my fave), and a giant lollypop for the kiddo. Everyone is happy and having so much fun. $19.50 1:30 p.m. — We stop for lunch at the Blue Bayou restaurant. All I want is a burger and fries, but instead we have to do a full sit-down lunch. It is a little too formal for my daughter and she already starts to close her eyes. We rush through lunch, and then she and I go back to the hotel for a nap. The hubby and rest of the family continue on. $170.55 5:30 p.m. — Nap time is over and we are back to meet the rest of the group. Daughter spots a balloon and I buy it for her. $9 6:30 p.m. — More junk food ($25), a toy for my kid ($24), and Disney holiday ornaments for me ($99). Disney has been done and we are going to watch the parade and then head back to the hotel to watch fireworks from our room. $148 Daily Total: $354.55",6,209
"6:30 a.m. — Why, God, why? My daughter, who generally sleeps until 8, wakes at 6:30 a.m. My body rebels! My legs and feet ache from the miles we walked yesterday. Tired is an understatement. We decide to get up and get home. We pack and check out ($439), and then stop by IHOP for breakfast ($42.56). Those pancakes are still good. $481.56 12:30 p.m. — We are too tired to move and order in lunch — poke bowls. $35.36 6:30 p.m. — More takeout. Thai food. Still tired. Time to get the little one ready for bed. She is fighting sleep because she is off schedule, and doesn't go down until close to 9 p.m. I muster up some energy to do a little food prep for the week, clean up, and head to bed. Asleep before my head hits the pillow. $41.56 Daily Total: $558.48",7,209
"7 a.m. — I was home in CT this weekend to see a friend perform in a play. I decide to stay over Sunday night to watch and hang out with my mom, so I take the 7:09 a.m. train back to NYC before work on Monday. My mom buys my train ticket, and I pass out immediately upon taking a seat. Luckily, this train isn't crowded, and because it's not an express — I actually get a seat! 8:52 a.m. — I arrive at the office a couple of minutes early, and am craving something yummy to drink. I head to the office kitchen and make a hot chocolate, and then pour it over a giant mug of ice. I don't really like hot drinks so I always tend to ice my drinks, even if its hot chocolate. 12:15 p.m. — Work is a little crazy today as usual because it's a Monday. Most of the people I work with live overseas, so they are on a different time schedule than I am. That means on Mondays I get back to the office with an inbox full of emails to respond to. I don't have time to run out to grab lunch, so I run downstairs to the little coffee shop in our building to grab lunch. I order an iced decaf (because caffeine doesn't agree with me) soy latte and a split pea soup. $15.93 5:15 p.m. — I was feeling a little nauseous because it's that time of the month, so I leave the office early. Because I was away this past weekend, there is no food in my fridge. I stop at the grocery store on my way home. I'm craving Applegate chicken slices and string cheese. Apparently, when I'm on my period, I turn into an eight year old. I also grab a couple of other things while I'm there. $18.98 7 p.m. — Time for my call with my therapist! I have clinical anxiety so I speak to a therapist on the phone once every two weeks. She is the best, and has totally helped me get my anxiety under control. I barely even notice it anymore. I honestly think everyone should speak to a therapist. It has been invaluable for my health and growth. I was lucky to find ""my person"" after only trying one therapist. I know most people have to try a few different therapists before they find someone who is the right fit, but my uncle recommended this woman to me and she is fantastic. Also, my uncle graciously pays for my sessions! I cannot thank him enough. 8:15 p.m. — After my call, I quickly get ready for a first date. We met on Bumble and he seems super cute, nice, and smart. I meet him at my favorite bar because I like to know my surroundings and feel comfortable when I'm meeting someone for the first time. He was everything I expected, but there isn't much chemistry and the conversation doesn't flow easily. I haven't decided if I want to go on a second date with him yet. I have to sleep on it. $28.31 Daily Total: $63.22",1,210
"8:30 a.m. — I run out of my apartment and catch the subway to work. I stop at a coffee shop on my way and get an iced decaf soy latte. $5.29 12 p.m. — This morning has run nonstop! I run out to grab lunch from a juice store that I have a gift card to (thanks, Grandma!), and order an açai bowl. 4:20 p.m. — Feeling hungry and cranky towards the end of the workday, but luckily there is chocolate in my office kitchen. I walk over and grab a couple pieces of Nestle milk chocolate with almonds to hold me over until dinnertime. Gotta love free office snacks! 5:15 p.m. — I leave the office and am really struggling to not stop for a snack on my way home. I have dinner plans at 7, but I must have a snack at home that I can eat to hold me over. I quickly scarf down a couple bites of hummus when I get home. 6:40 p.m. — My friend gets out of work earlier than expected, so we meet a little before 7 for poke bowls. I've never had it before, but she introduces me to a place that's right near my apartment. It was delicious. I know it won't be the last time I come here. $13.07 8:15 p.m. — I stop at Duane Reade on my way home to pick up batteries for my vibrator, and also grab chocolate while I'm at it. The PMS stereotype continues. $19.14 Daily Total: $37.50",2,210
"9 a.m. — I get to the office in time for my 9:30 a.m. call! I didn't want to risk being late so I didn't stop for coffee. I've never been a big breakfast person because if I eat too early in the morning it makes me nauseous. I guess I'll have to wait for lunch time. 12 p.m. — Starved because I didn't have my morning coffee to hold me over, I decide to get a lunch with a bit more substance and protein, even though I know I should use that gift card from the juice place. I stop at a place a few blocks away from my office and get a spicy chicken quinoa bowl and a chia pudding. $16.92 3 p.m. — My coworker is pregnant and has gestational diabetes, so she's ridding her office of snacks she can no longer eat. She gives me a little pack of rice cake rollers, which are basically cylindrical shaped rice cakes and they are delicious. I may have to order a box of these snacks for my desk! Crunchy and sweet but still kind of healthy — the perfect snack. 5 p.m. — I dart out of the office with a coworker to grab a drink and catch up. It's been way too long since we have been able to talk and hang out outside of the office. We each get a margarita, slowly drink them, and then decide to go home and get some rest instead of drinking too much. $10.52 7:30 p.m. — After waiting for the Q train for quite some time, I make it home. I eat black bean chips and hummus for dinner. Not that hungry after my big lunch today. 10:30 p.m. — I'm exhausted and the one drink make me even sleepier, so I crawl into bed and pass out. Daily Total: $27.44",3,210
"8:45 a.m. — I have a conference call at 9, so I get to the office a few minutes early to give myself time to stop for coffee. $5.29 12:30 p.m. — Okay, I HAVE to use this gift card and stop spending money when I have free money sitting in my pocket. I leisurely walk to the juice shop, because it's nice to get fresh air when you spend all day inside of an office. I order another açai bowl, perfect for hot summer days in the city! 3:15 p.m. — I hit the 3 p.m. wall hard today and am dreaming of the sushi I'm getting in T-three hours. I text my friend about dinner and we end up having an extensive food emoji and GIF conversation. He's the best. 5:15 p.m. — I couldn't sit at my desk any longer killing time, so I leave the office knowing that I will get to the restaurant early. I get there 15 minutes early, but I'd rather sit at the restaurant on my phone than at my desk on my phone! 6 p.m. — My friend arrives and we each order a drink and food! I get a lychee-tini, miso soup, a spicy salmon roll, and a spicy tuna roll. We also order shishito peppers to split. They are delicious, and it's exciting knowing that you may randomly get a super spicy one; livin' life on the edge. My friend insists on buying my dinner as a congratulations for the promotion I recently got, so I don't spend any money! Again, he's the best. 7:30 p.m. — Home! I decide to lay in bed and watch instead of cleaning my room. It looks like a tornado swept through here because this week has been a little crazy, but I just don't have the energy to deal with it right now. My roommates get home a couple of hours later and we watch an episode of together. After, I retreat back to my bed and pass out around 10:15. Daily Total: $5.29",4,210
"7:45 a.m. — I wake up this morning and feel AWFUL. I'm super nauseous and my stomach is doing unkind things to my digestive system. I text my boss and tell her I can't come into work. She's great and tells me to get some rest and feel better soon. After spending some time in the bathroom, I crawl back into bed and get a couple more hours of shut eye. 10 a.m. — I set my alarm for 9:55 to make sure I'm awake to purchase tickets to live! It's the absolute best podcast, and I highly recommend it. Basically, it's a son reading the porno his dad wrote with two of his friends. Aside from the fact that the porno novel is absurd and amazing, they are all comedians — so their comments are hilarious. They are performing live in NYC, so three of my friends and I all buy tickets. I charge it on my card to get the points, and it totals $196.80, coming out at $49.20 per person. Front row balcony, hell yeah! Well worth it. $49.20 11:45 p.m. — It looks like I'm going to be spending a lot of money today. Pentatonix Christmas Special tickets went on sale, and it could be one of the last times all five of them perform together, so I have to get a ticket. I've been listening to them for years and can't miss this chance even though I know its super expensive. But our seats are amazing! $188.25 3:50 p.m. — After hours of laying in bed and feeling like death, it's time to meet my sister and another one of her bridesmaids to look for and try on bridesmaids dresses. Although I feel super gross, I'm the maid of honor and can't skip. Here's to hoping I don't reenact that scene in ... 6:15 p.m. — We don't end up buying dresses but there are some super cute options — and we think we know what we want! We will probably buy in a couple of weeks after a little more investigation. 7 p.m. — I'm still not feeling great, so I place an order on Seamless. I get extra food to avoid having to cook or go out. Chicken parm totally hits the spot. I start watching and end up binge-watching five episodes. How did I just learn of this fantastic show? Why is Hilary Duff perfection? And how can I be her friend? (Side note: The show sometimes films on my block, so maybe how I'll become her friend...) $33.49 11:44 p.m. — After catching up with the roomies when they get home, I pass out. Daily Total: $270.94",5,210
"9:30 a.m. — I'm very relieved to wake up feeling much better today. I lay in bed and watch YouTube videos for 30 minutes, then get up to shower and get ready for brunch. 11:15 p.m. — Every year for my sister's birthday, I get her a little present and take her out to a boozy brunch just for the two of us. We decide to walk to the restaurant because its only 25 minutes away and the weather outside is perfect. It's a cash-only restaurant so I stop at an ATM on the way and take out $60. I already have a $20 bill, so that should cover the brunch for both of us. We arrive and each order bottomless mimosas and an entree for only $28 each! After tax, tip, and coffee, the bill comes out to $80, exactly what I have. $80 1:30 p.m. — My sister and I tipsily wander around the Lower East Side and pop into a few cool, local stores to browse. We end up walking into The Market, where I see an amazing, black crossbody purse with a gold chain strap and and a 1920s-style embroidered woman on it. The artist comes over and says he designs everything himself, and that the drawings were inspired by ones his grandfather did in 1926. Also, the leather purse was made by a leather smith who also sells in the market. Being an artist myself, I can't help but buy it! I love supporting local artists. $72 5:30 p.m. — Now that I'm back home, I continue to watch and eat my leftover chicken parm for dinner. My stomach is still acting weird, so I decide to stay in tonight and chill. 9:45 p.m. — After too many hours watching and feeling gross, I retreat to my bed and go to sleep early. Because I fell asleep so early, I'm up at 3 a.m. for an hour, but then finally manage to get back to sleep. Daily Total: $152",6,210
"9:30 a.m. — Wake up and head back to the couch for more . Isn't that what Sundays are for? 11:15 a.m. — I make myself a smoothie with a banana, almond butter, chocolate protein powder, almond milk, and ice. It kind of tastes like a chocolate banana milk shake so I'm very satisfied. 4 p.m. — Today has been super relaxing and quiet. I took a nap, hung out with my roommates, and watched a little more . We start cleaning the apartment and get ready to have people over for the finale tonight! I can't wait. 6:20 p.m. — One of my roommates decides to make edamame pasta with red sauce for dinner, which is one of my favorites. The texture of the pasta is amazing, and we use tomato sauce from The Meatball Shop. What could be better? 8 p.m. — Our friends start arriving for the finale! We watch a little of the VMAs before the final episode goes live at 9 p.m. The suspense is killing us! 10:30 p.m. — IT WAS EVERYTHING WE HOPED FOR. No spoilers, but this episode was freaking amazing. We hang out and talk theories for about an hour. Once everyone leaves around 11:30, I brush my teeth, wash my face, and head to bed. Daily Total: $0",7,210
"6:15 a.m. — Wake up and get ready for work/clinic. Make brewed coffee at home (Trader Joe's Bali) with a splash of whole cream. Nixed the Starbucks habit (morning and afternoon) when I stopped drinking soy milk. (I don't like regular milk). Let the dogs out and feed them so my husband can sleep in. Have half a cup of yogurt, read/journal, and drive to clinic. 11 a.m. — Morning clinic done! Head home. Grab gas at the corner station near work. I drive quite a bit for work and need to start taking advantage of my practice's gas reimbursement program. $39.52 11:30 a.m. — Craving Indian food! Call a friend to see if she's free for lunch. She isn't, so I have rotisserie chicken (store bought by hubby yesterday) and steamed broccoli and cauliflower at home. ""Dessert"" is a slice of deli turkey and Swiss cheese. I get peckish when I'm not busy at work (no afternoon clinic), so I graze on leftover holiday candy and cookies, mixed nuts, and an egg while reading for work, watching , and catching up on email. I buy a 2017 Passion Planner online for $29.50. Husband pays his $50 community softball league dues. $79.50 3:45 p.m. — Head out to an hour-long barre class. (I have one year's worth of unlimited classes already paid for.) 6 p.m. — Get ready for a work dinner at a new Italian restaurant. It's funded by our annual dues and is covered by work. I hitch a ride with a great work/life friend and catch up with old and new colleagues. Eat bruschetta, a Caesar salad, and choose the salmon and polenta entrée. Once food arrives, I eye my colleagues' pork ribs and mashed potatoes with envy. 10:30 p.m. — Ugh! One colleague WOULD NOT STOP TALKING! I finally get home over an hour after schedule and get coffee ready for the next day. Catch up with hubby for a little bit and turn in by 11 p.m. Daily Total: $119.02",1,211
"6:25 a.m. — Wake up, let the dogs out, and feed them. Have the same brewed coffee and half a cup of yogurt at home. Read for leisure and drive to clinic. Work mornings are pretty routine. 11 a.m. — Morning clinic done! Head home and wait for hubby to finish his massage appointment so we can get together for lunch. I try to stave off ""hanger"" by making dental insurance phone calls (without getting anywhere), sorting through junk and work mail, and watching Trump's inauguration. Hubby's sports massage is part of a prepaid package and he tips in cash. $20 1:30 p.m. — Finally kill my Indian food craving! Hubby and I have the unlimited lunch buffet with chicken tikka masala, saag paneer and various other goodies. Yum! ($21.54 + $2 tip) $23.54 2:30 p.m. — Craving dessert, so I pop into Himalayan Bazar next door to the Indian restaurant. They have (overpriced) Cadbury chocolate; instead, I get Nimboo Pudina peanuts for $1.79. They only take cash. I eat a few handfuls on the drive home, plus mango cookies after I get home. $1.79 3:30 p.m. — Hubby comes home with groceries. (I love him!) He bought whole grain bread, a 12-pack of Diet 7UP, beef, full cream, ranch salad dressing, field greens, precut broccoli, cauliflower and carrots, and 2% Greek yogurt. $62.45 4 p.m. — Working and reading at home plus snacking mindlessly on Swiss cheese slices and handfuls of peanuts. Order a one-year subscription to a work-related medical journal for $600. Work reimburses the cost (whew!). Hubby comes back from getting our bulldog's nails clipped ($10). I head out to a half-hour barre class. $10 6:30 p.m. — Back from barre with a Redbox DVD. I'm too full for dinner. Spend the rest of the evening intermittently watching the DVD, reading, and screening after-hours emergency phone calls from patients. Hubby cooks himself steak. I steal bites after he offers me a taste. $2.17 10:15 p.m. — Late-night shopping online. I put items in carts from various websites without actually buying them. Find out I have a $36 PayPal ""balance,"" i.e. money to spend. I buy a last-minute Kendra Scott e-gift card for a friend's birthday. $50 Daily Total: $169.95",2,211
"7:45 a.m. — I love Saturdays! Same routine as weekdays, except I start a little later, and my hubby's usually up and takes care of the dogs. Have coffee and half a cup of yogurt. Catch up with hubby and take a phone call from one of my patients. Still feeling munchy, so I boil half-a-dozen fresh duck and chicken eggs and eat a freshly cooked duck egg! So good and rich. Open Amazon, where I thought I made a purchase last night (books, hair oil, sling back strap holders, and an anti-blister stick for $166.15). It turns out that everything I ""ordered"" is still in my cart, with no record of the order being processed. I leave the items un-purchased, and spend the morning doing minor errands around the house and touching base with a friend for tonight's evening out. 12 p.m. — Barre class done. Errands time! Drop off my broken iPad for repair. My favorite Blowpro dry shampoo has a $5 in-store coupon, so I get it for $10.77. Given last night's purchasing fiasco, I hit up Half Price Books to use my $25 Secret Santa gift card. I get four books for $10.68. Get brows, et. al. done for $17 (including $3 tip). $38.45 2 a.m. — Finally make it home and I'm starving. Eat some of the rotisserie chicken with field greens, broccoli, and cauliflower mixed with leftover Chick-Fil-A avocado-lime ranch dressing. (It's available in stores.) Catch up on recreational reading, etc. and snack on peanuts and mango cookies for dessert. Much on goat cheese afterwards. 7 p.m. — Hubby gets gas for his truck. We have an early dinner of two slices deli turkey and guacamole at home prior to heading out. $65 7:30 p.m. — At Topgolf for a friend's 35th birthday. While waiting for a station, I get a shot of single malt scotch, and hubby has two Crown And 7s. We tip $9. $53.92 9 p.m. — Finally get golf stations and start playing. Hubby orders appetizers and his dinner: chips with queso, salsa, guacamole, calamari, a Cobb salad and pickle fries. I get a glass of Malbec and he gets another Crown And 7. Food and drinks come to $79 after the $12.43 tip. Later, hubby gets two rounds of golf for $83.60 for the group. I nibble on food over the next two and a half hours. It was an expensive evening! $162.60 12 a.m. — FINALLY MAKE IT HOME! Lights out at 12:30. Daily Total: $319.97",3,211
"7:30 a.m. — Not ready to get up, but sun's up and I can't sleep. Two cups of coffee over conversation with Mom. No room for yogurt. I head off to barre class. 10:45 a.m. — Pick up repaired iPad screen ($89) and get a new cover for $20.  After tax, it comes out to $117.99. Grab groceries for slow-cooked Asian beef stew: baby potatoes, bell peppers, onions, tomato sauce, crushed tomatoes, and baby carrots. I also get a can of mixed nuts, prepared broccoli, and bacon salad and kale with parmesan salad from the deli section, plus a copy of about the inauguration. Everything costs $45.35, and I get $50 cash back. $163.34 12 p.m. — Throw ingredients for the beef stew into the slow cooker. Eat the broccoli and bacon salad for lunch with a hard-boiled egg, and have mixed nuts for dessert. Debate another barre class, but decide to catch up on reading and errands at home. 3 p.m. — Hour-long therapeutic massage (pre-paid package). I tip $15 in cash and return the Redbox DVD. $15 4:45 p.m. — Get home and have various eats over the next few hours. Start with kale and parmesan salad, and watch hubby watch football. Taste test the stew; I love the broth and have two cups. Hubby gives it his thumbs up! Eat a hard-boiled duck egg, browse house tours, and catch up with minor work while hubby watches football. Call parents, and head to bed at 9:30. Daily Total: $178.34",4,211
"6:20 a.m. — Wake up and make coffee. Hubby gets up early and takes care of the dogs. I eat half a cup of yogurt for breakfast, get to clinic, and power through a busy morning clinic. Happy Monday! 12:20 p.m. — Lunch of bacon and broccoli salad, and a few bites of deli turkey. I'm not very hungry for lunch. I get a reminder to pay the 2016 property taxes in the mail. Start round two of clinic after lunch; thankfully, it's less hectic than the morning. 4 p.m. — Get home and munch on handfuls of mixed nuts, a hard-boiled egg, goat cheese, mango cookies, shortbread cookies, and peppermint chocolate while unwinding from work and catching up on recreational reading. See additional Redbox late charge. Grrr! $2.16 5:40 p.m. — “Dinner” is a few bites of Asian beef stew. I'm too stuffed to eat more! Forego barre tonight since my Mondays are usually workout rest days. Catch up on work notes, email, and reading for fun with playing in the background. Hubby buys mountain bike gear ($49.99) and bike chain cleaner ($23.80). Off to bed at 9:30. $73.79 Daily Total: $75.95",5,211
"7:15 a.m. — Get up, make coffee, and have half-cup of plain Greek yogurt. Hubby is up and takes care of the dogs. Head out for an hour of barre at 9:30 a.m. 10:30 a.m. — Pop-up shop and sale at barre studio. I get joggers ($10), shorts ($10) and a Hard Tail yoga tank ($15), all in black. I pay cash. $35 11:30 a.m. — Hubby comes home with groceries: Ranch and ""lite"" Italian dressing, field greens, a rotisserie chicken, 2% plain Greek yogurt, deli turkey, and charcoal ($50.41). He also bought bike cleaning degreaser from Lowe's ($10.83) and cleaning tools from Amazon ($23.80). $85.04 12 p.m. — Work-life bestie wants to do lunch, and hubby wants to try a new Korean place near his university. We order Korean flapjacks, spring rolls, and calamari for appetizers. Lunch is pork belly (boiled bacon, which I end up ) with kimchi, zucchini, and sprouts for me, and grilled spicy chicken with rice and similar sides; bestie gets beef bibimbap. Hubby is impressed; bestie and I less so. Hubby's and my share is $30.69 plus tip. $37 3 p.m. — Get front tires. No charge for the services, and no cash on me for tip. Get home and snack on mixed nuts, goat cheese, broccoli, and a slice of deli turkey. 6:45 p.m. — Another barre class! Catch up on recreational reading after barre. Hubby watches news, and it's lights out at 10:30. Daily Total: $157.04",6,211
"6:15 a.m. — Wake up, get coffee going, and take care of the dogs. Have half a cup of plain Greek yogurt and read while eating breakfast. See patients in clinic from 8 a.m. to noon. 12:30 p.m. — Get home for lunch: rotisserie chicken, kale with parmesan salad, and hard-boiled egg. Nuts for dessert. 1 p.m. — Munch on mango and shortbread cookies and peppermint chocolate while reading recreationally. Hubby gets home for lunch. He swung by the store for a bottle of Canadian whiskey. $16 2 p.m. — Get tire fixed. Thankfully, it was still under warranty, so it's free. Swing by Barnes & Noble while waiting and buy two books. Both are much cheaper on Amazon but I have a $50 gift card and I don't really want any other books. $1.64 4 p.m. — Get car cleaned. I have an $89.99 gift certificate from work. I choose an exterior cleaning and wax package and get talked into adding a $35 interior detailing. To be fair, I can't remember the last time I had my car interior cleaned. Total is $129.99. I pay with the gift card and leave a $10 tip. $45 5:30 p.m. — Get home still feeling kind of full. I eat a slice of Swiss cheese with almonds. Feeling under the weather, so I decide to skip barre class. I munch more on a slice of deli turkey and leftover Korean pancakes with beef. My sweet tooth kicks in and I go for a shortbread cookie and peppermint-chocolate kisses. Decide to eat “real food” later, and have a few bites of Asian beef stew and a slice of whole grain bread. Read and catch up with hubby while he eats dinner. Continue to catch up on recreational reading while hubby watches TV. Off to bed at 10! Daily Total: $62.64",7,211
"7 a.m. — Wake up. Feed my dog-child. Eat a protein bar on the patio while checking emails. If I woke up earlier, I would have time to make breakfast, but sleep is so good. Get ready, which entails a quick shower, skincare routine, and mascara. (In the mornings, I cleanse, tone, moisturize, apply eye cream. I love trying new products and am always changing it up. I always go back to Korres for my cleanser and moisturizer though. I haven’t found anything better. My favorite mascara is Two Faced Better than Sex.) Then I head out the door. I’ve trained my hair to air dry exactly how I want it to over the years. It is insanely curly, so I just throw some product on it and let it do its thing; no point in fighting it. 8:15 a.m. — Have to stop to get gas on the way to the office (I fill up the tank) so I’m a tad late. Stop into the kitchen to get a glass of cold brew with almond milk and a dog treat before the weekly progress morning meeting. Our office is stalked with various types of coffee and water so I never buy either. I drink approximately a million LaCroix and at least three liters of water from my hydroflask every day. My boss and I are obsessed with my dog, so I get to bring him to work. I cannot express how much I love my job for this, and a thousand other reasons. $58 8:30 a.m. — Put in my headphones, turn on my podcast, and get to work; same routine every single day. I listen to the same few regularly, but my most recent favorite is it's so interesting and in-depth. We have an in-office chat on our computers, so if anyone needs to talk to anyone else, they message you first — hence why I can wear headphones without being rude. 12:25 p.m. — Long morning of calls and drawing. We are an exclusively commercial firm (no houses or residential projects of any kind), and we are each responsible for entire projects. It is a smaller firm so we don’t really have the manpower to do collaborative projects in terms of actual production. That means I do everything from initial concept to full construction sets of plans, all needed documents, and then the construction management until the project is closed out. We do help red-line (correct) each other’s plans, and all designs are signed off on by the owner of the firm. We also have a few draftsmen that help on most projects on a case-by-case basis. In most firms, the architect will do the design and oversee the project and the meat of the drawing, and production is done by draftsmen. I much prefer total control of the project. It makes for a longer turnover time for clients, but I love that I get to do both the creative and technical sides of the industry. 12:45 p.m. — A coworker and I head to lunch to decompress. Street tacos from our favorite local place and a side of chicken for dog-child. His turn to pay. 3:30 p.m. — Site meeting with new contractor on a project about to break ground. I pick up a box of donuts (a.k.a., please-don’t-be-a-dick-to-me snacks) on the way there. I have found that most contractors don’t take to well to a woman being the one in charge of them, especially a 26-year-old one. I completely understand, and that mentality doesn’t bother me in the least. This has been a male-dominated industry for a very long time and I love that I have the opportunity to be a part of it and help it grow — but for now, donuts tend to help ease them into realizing that I’m actually decent at my job. $20 (Not expensed because this is my thing, not a company requirement.) 6 p.m. — Site meeting done. Contractor was fantastic, subcontractors not so much. I can see some serious problems down the line. Hopefully their teams are better than they are. Head back to the office to pick up my stuff and head home. 7 p.m. — Get back home and start on dinner. Cooking is one of my favorite ways to relax. Tonight, it's fish tacos with whatever veggies I find left in my fridge, mostly just carrots and cucumber. My boyfriend Skypes while I’m cooking. He is currently living in Washington doing his residency at a hospital. We Skype once or twice a week when he gets chance. Residency is no joke, but he’s only got three months left before he gets to move back here, where he has already accepted a job offer. My dog always eats his dog food at the same time as I do; he doesn’t like eating alone. He’s more human than dog. Also, I call him dog-child because that exactly what he is. He is two-years-old and the love of my life. I’m a fully admitted crazy dog lady and I love it. 10:30 p.m. — Go for a long walk with the dog-child around the property after dinner. He chased squirrels and I enjoyed the quiet. Skin care routine (nightly: double cleanse face, exfoliate every other day, toner, serum, corrector, moisturizer, eye cream and spot treatment if needed) and pass out as soon as we got home. Daily total: $78",1,212
"6:45 a.m. — Same morning routine as yesterday, but I’m out of protein bars and I’m starving. Quick stop for a green smoothie ($8) filled with all sorts of healthy stuff. Also stop at my favorite fruit stand and get strawberries ($4) since, let's be honest, green smoothies aren’t exactly filling. $12 8 a.m. — Make it to the office on time this morning. Cold brew and almond milk again. 9 a.m. — Spend a quick hour prepping for a design meeting with a new client, and ordering bagels ($35, expensed). Jobs are dispersed by the boss as they come in. The larger ones go to head architects, and the smaller go to what we call project architects. Our boss does a great job at keeping it very even and giving us clients that we will work well with. One of my coworkers has been working exclusively with one large scale client on multiple projects for almost four years. 11:30 a.m. — Design meeting went as well as could be hoped for with a new client. Our design styles don’t match quite as well as I’d hoped, but I think we will be able to make it work. 12 p.m. — Lunch time. Our new summer intern just started and I haven’t gotten the chance to get to know him at all. A coworker and I take him out to lunch. We walk over to the sandwich place a few blocks away. I have the veggie sandwich with spinach, tomato, roasted peppers, onion, avocado, pickles, and sriracha aioli on toasted wheat. The intern seems like a good kid, and he and my dog are already friends. My treat today. $46 6:30 p.m. — Long afternoon of cranking away on construction documents. Head out of the office and to the grocery store. I make it quick so that dog-child can wait in the car. Trader Joe's has a lot of good shady parking spots, so I head there. I get broccoli, bananas, peppers, quinoa, protein bars (Gomacro are the best), Ezekiel bread, feta cheese, and vegan butter. In and out in 10 minutes. That will hold me over until I go to the farmers' market on Saturday. As far as diet goes, I eat mostly-healthy. I don’t follow any labeled lifestyle, but I tend to stay away from most dairy and sugar. I don’t eat much processed or packaged food, mostly because I love cooking. The one rule I very rarely break is no drinking during the work week. I can’t afford to be tired and foggy at work. $41 7:15 p.m. — Drop groceries and dog off at home and head to the gym. TRX class tonight taught by my landlord. I thought my hydroflask was full, but I guess I drank it all. I won’t make it through her class without water, so I grab a bottle from the “protein bar” in the gym. $4 9 p.m. — Get home and start dinner. Keeping it simple tonight with just some sautéed veggies and quinoa covered in sriracha. 11 p.m. — Head to bed after letting dog-child swim for a little while. He loves swimming but isn’t very good, so I have to watch him. He’s so large (140 pounds) that he pretty much sinks if he stops paddling. I tried to get him a life vest, but he hated it. I also put on a couple of masks while watching him swim, an Aztec clay mask and a Dr. Jart sheet mask while half-watching . Daily Total: $103",2,212
"6:45 a.m. — Same morning routine, with a protein bar today. I hate mornings, so I really don’t do much other than the bare minimum. 8 a.m. — Head into work and get started on plan, and check comments for a project that I’m hoping will break ground in the next three months. Cold brew with almond milk as always. 1:45 p.m. — No meetings this morning, so I get completely lost in work. Dog is hungry and won't let me keep working without feeding him. We run down the street to a little family Greek place. I get a combo plate with moussaka, spanakopita, Greek salad, and humus with pita; he gets chicken. We are both very happy. Yes, I eat lunch out every day. I hate both mornings and meal prepping, and I love being able to take a break outside the office. It’s expensive, but I don’t plan on stopping any time soon. I justify it by only eating at local places and telling myself I’m supporting the local economy and small businesses. $18 6 p.m. — Leave the office and because of the late lunch, I’m not dying to get home and eat dinner. We head to the beach for a little while, and my boyfriend’s brother meets us there with his dog. 8:30 p.m. — After a long beach walk, we get home and I make toast with almond butter and bananas. 9 p.m. — Zone out on the couch watching Netflix. Sitting in front of the computer all day really drains me, so I head to bed early tonight. Skin care routine first, then sleep. Daily Total: $18",3,212
"6:45 a.m. — Same morning as always, except today is Friday, so I decide to grab a green smoothie on the way to the office. Really exciting celebration, I know. $7 8 a.m. — Get into work and the monthly coffee delivery shows up. My boss is a huge coffee nerd and this is his favorite day of the month. 12:30 p.m. — Lunch time after working on plans all morning. (I really didn’t realize how often I ate tacos until I started writing this.) Tacos for me and chicken for dog-child again, but from a different restaurant. $13 4 p.m. — Since it's Friday, we all leave work early. I head home and change and go to the gym, hopefully for spin if they have any openings. 5:30 p.m. — No openings for class, so I do some HIIT exercises and throw in abs for good measure. Grab a water on my way out. $4 5:45 p.m. — Quick stop for gas. $45 6 p.m. — Pick up dog from my house and go to my parents' for dinner. My dad calls and asks if can pick up soy sauce on the way. After I get there, he finishes his grilled, glazed salmon and vegetables. I definitely got my love of cooking from him. $6 7 p.m. — My mom wants to go shopping, and I never turn down a good shopping trip. We go to Nordstrom and head for the shoe department, my weakness. I end up getting a new pair of fantastic wedges that are on sale for a crazy price. Then we head over to Lululemon: weakness number two. If I’m not at the office, I’m wearing leggings from there. I pick up a new pair of leggings and a couple of headbands. $273 10:30 p.m. — Get home and Skype with the BF. Dog-child stayed with my dad while I went shopping, so he is worn out from playing. Fall asleep a couple of hours later and thank my lucky stars I don’t have to wake up early tomorrow. Daily Total: $348",4,212
"8:15 a.m. — This is what I consider sleeping in now and that’s a little sad, but it also means I get the best pick of food at the farmers' market. Dog-child and I head down and buy all the food: mixed greens, cucumbers, tomatoes, snap peas, peaches, carrots, sweet onions, avocados, corn, jalapeños, nectarines, eggs, almond butter, cherries, tortillas, shrimp, and a delicious breakfast sandwich with egg, caramelized onions and peppers, and spicy sauce on an English muffin. I love the farmers' market because you know it's local, and you also can control exactly how much you are getting. There are no fresher options either; almost everything was either picked within the last three days, caught this morning, or made this week. It makes it so easy to eat healthy when healthy food tastes this good. $60 11:30 a.m. — While putting away my groceries, there is a knock at my door. That never happens and it’s a little weird. I go over and hesitantly answer it. It’s my boyfriend! He got his schedule for the week a couple of days ago and he had three days in a row off, which is unheard of for him, so he decided to grab a plane ticket and come surprise me! We haven’t seen each other in almost three months and this is about the best surprise I could have imagined! 3:30 p.m. — We spend a few hours just hanging out, swimming, snacking on some of my groceries, and playing with the dog (who is more excited to see my boyfriend than I even was). We get ready and head to his parents' for before going to dinner. We stop and pick up some flowers on the way for his mom because why not. $12 4 p.m. — Get to his parents’ house and my family is there, too! Apparently, he told everyone but me he was coming. Nice. Our families have been friends for as long as anyone can remember — long before we started dating — so it’s always fun to hang out together. 5:30 p.m. — Everyone heads to dinner at one of our favorite local places. Our dads split the check. They are the best. 10:30 p.m. — My boyfriend, and three of our six-combined siblings, my best friend, and I all head to the bar for a little bit. Just one round; my drink is Jack and ginger. $65 11:30 p.m. — Street vendor churros! $4 Daily Total: $141",5,212
"8 a.m. — This is the latest either of us could manage to sleep in. Dog spent the night at boyfriend’s parents’ house with their dog, so we take that as an opportunity and go out to breakfast. Omelets, home fries, and fruit. He pays. 9:30 a.m. — We walk around downtown for a little while through a couple vintage stores. I am working on the master bath right now, which is my last room to finish renovating. I find the most amazing patterned black and white tile for the shower, but they only have one box. It's crazy cheap, and I buy it in hopes that my tile guy can replicate it. $35 12:30 p.m. — Pick up dog child and head to the beach where we end up spending the rest of the day. I live so close to the beach that I always have a couple of towels and a swimsuit in my car. I never really plan beach days but always seem to end up there. Buy a fruit bowl and waters from a stand in the parking lot. BF pays. 7:45 p.m. — Get home and make dinner: a huge salad with a variety of veggies from the farmers' market and balsamic dressing I make weekly. (It's best dressing ever: two-thirds of a cup of olive oil, one-third of a cup of balsamic vinegar, minced garlic, salt and pepper, whisked until emulsified). Grilled corn and peaches with a drizzle of balsamic vinegar on the side. So good! I really love cooking with him. We’ve been dating for four years and have been waiting until we live in the same city again to get engaged. Both of us are super ready and excited to do the whole marriage thing (and kids someday); we just don’t want to be living in different states when we start that part of our lives. 11 p.m. — Fall asleep while watching (my favorite) on Netflix.

"6:45 a.m. — Alarm goes off. I texted my boss and asked if I could take the morning off today. He said absolutely, and that I could have the entire day if I wanted. Boyfriend flies back to Washington at 1, so I can head into work after that. We lay around for a while, dreading the impending drive to the airport. 9:30 a.m. — Drag ourselves out of bed and go to the smoothie place. We each get a smoothie and a “dog-çai” bowl for dog-child (peanut butter and oats and a dog cookie). Long beach walk while we drink our smoothies. $21 11:45 a.m. — Drop off boyfriend at the airport. It sucks, bad. I’m not a crier or even very emotional in general, so that’s a big plus in these situations, but it obviously still sucks. Hopefully, I will make it up to Washington soon and only three months before he is back here for good. $10 (for parking) 2 p.m. — I was going to go to work, but I’m too lazy. I answer most of my emails from the porch and then clean my house. I’m a bit intense when it comes to my home, and I normally deep clean my place every Saturday morning after the farmers' market, but that didn’t happen, so I do it now! It feels really good to have a clean space to start the week. I also throw in a few loads of laundry, give the dog a bath, and clean the pool. I’m trying out this whole audiobook thing, so I listen to a new one while I clean. Not really liking it. The book seems good but being read to feels a bit like elementary school. I have credits, so the book is free. 8 p.m. — My best friend comes over and I make us dinner. We normally hang out and catch up on our weeks on the weekend, but I was a bit preoccupied this weekend. She’s a teacher and we pretty much gave up on weeknight hangouts because of pure exhaustion. Balsamic glazed vegetables because I LOVE balsamic vinegar. (Given the choice between that and any sweet, I will literally drink the vinegar.) I also make grilled shrimp. We eat while watching and both fall asleep on the couch. Eventually, we wake up and drag ourselves to bed. My guest room is pretty much her bedroom. I even put her own set of toiletries in the bathroom for her. Daily Total: $31",7,212
"5:20 a.m. — My first of two alarms wakes me up. I have a headache, so I get a glass of cucumber-strawberry infused water I made last night. I get ready for the day, brush my teeth, do my makeup, pack my bag, and eat the breakfast my boyfriend made me — fried eggs and avocado toast. 7:45 a.m. — I get to work after my commute. I live downtown, but my job is in the suburbs so I have a 20-minute walk, 60-minute Metra ride, and a 10-minute shuttle ride. It's a long commute both ways, but worth it because I really love my job, and I don't want to give up living in the excitement of the city. 9:30 a.m. — My manager gives me a new project for the day. I need to focus on creating different juice recipes. 12 p.m. — I eat with coworkers for our daily catch-up lunch. Lunch at my office is pretty casual, and many people take the whole hour to talk and relax. I packed my own lunch and eat a caprese salad and strawberries. 3:30 p.m. — Finish my project, and my coworker IMs me that there is new food on the giveaway table. The giveaway table is where people put food samples or products they no longer need or want for experiments or taste tests. I get a bag of cookies that I've never seen before; they claim to be gluten-free, dairy-free, vegan, and organic. As someone who is not bound by any of those dietary restrictions, these cookies seem interesting... 5:45 p.m. — Finally make it to the gym after work. I've already hit my step goal of 12,000, but I'm training for a 10K and I want to win my coworker Fitbit challenge. The gym is more crowded earlier in the week, but I manage to get a run in on the treadmill. I fill up my water bottle before I leave. 7 p.m. — Home and showered. Usually my boyfriend and I cook dinner together, but tonight his football team is playing, and it's Monday night. I decide to cook bulgogi bowls using a recipe from Jet Tila's new cookbook. We always make dinner following recipes intended for four people; that way, we can pack up the leftovers for the next day's lunch. 8:30 p.m. — Dinner was delicious! I'm always happy when my boyfriend likes Asian food, since it's all I can make well (as that's what I grew up with). I leave the dishes for him and finish taking notes for my class. The rest of my night is spent watching lectures online and studying. I try to get through all the notes but I can only take so much. So tired; bed by 10:30. Daily Total: $0",1,213
"5:30 a.m. — Wake up and go through the routine again. Workday makeup consists of Urban Decay foundation, Benefit brows, and extreme contouring. Nice and simple, but most important, it takes about 10 minutes. It's raining, so my boyfriend offers to drive me to the train instead. Yes please! I get an extra 15 minutes and eat half of a giant Costco chocolate muffin. 7:45 a.m. — At work and the first thing I do is check for caffeine. No one has made the coffee yet, so I start the pot and make a cup of green tea. It's so gloomy outside. 8:30 a.m. — Today, the shoe mobile is here! At work, we are required to wear steel-toed boots in the plant. Our office nicely pays for one new pair of shoes per calendar year, and luckily, my 14-month work anniversary and the shoe mobile arrival are at the same time. I get a pair of sneakers; they're so much lighter than the boots I had last year — but, ugh, why do women's shoes have to be pink? ($95, expensed) 12 p.m. — Lunch! I eat the leftover bulgogi from yesterday's dinner. My coworkers and I discuss the possible changes that may be made to Obamacare, but we start to feel too stressed. It's hard to avoid politics when the only television in the cafeteria shows CNN 24/7. We attempt to make lighter conversation and talk about instead. 1 p.m. — Back to work and about to restart the juice project I was working on yesterday, but a coworker needs help. I give him a hand, and I am rewarded with the leftover juice he was taste testing! Sweetened beverages are taxed in Chicago, so it's always great to nab some free stuff from work to avoid the tax. 6 p.m. — Felt like a slow day at work. I read on the train and finally make it home. I planned to workout, but as soon as I get home, all my desire to do so vanishes. I relax on the couch and look at camping locations for our yearly Columbus Day weekend trip. I'm leaning towards a state park closer to the Wisconsin border, and reserve a spot for the long weekend to make sure we won't lose out. $20 7:30 p.m. — Supposed to go to dinner with a friend, but she calls saying her work event ran long and she will be late. She works for the Bears, so she's constantly busy with events. It's hard to match up timing with her so I don't want to cancel. I reschedule our dinner reservation. 8:30 p.m. — Finally dinnertime! My boyfriend, friend, and I meet at tavern and inn down the street from our apartment. It's so quaint and rustic, and we find out that it's still an operating inn! The only way we can afford to eat here is the $5 burger and fries special. Since we save on food, we each get a glass of wine, too. It's a great combo; burger and Champagne. The three of us split the bill. $15 10 p.m. — Home with a food baby. Play with the cat a little and in bed by 10:30. Daily Total: $35",2,213
"5:30 a.m. — Waking up is so hard, especially since the sun doesn't rise as early anymore. I drink more infused water and go about my routine. I quickly fry some eggs and sausage and feed the cat. 7:30 a.m. — Get into work a little earlier today since I drove. Traffic in Chicago sucks, but I still beat the train to work. Plus, I get some time to catch up on my favorite podcasts, and . Drink a small cup of tea and get back to my juice project. 12 p.m. — As my coworker and I head down to lunch, we pick up a box of a new, limited edition, flavored taste-test products from the giveaway table. It doesn't taste too bad, but I wonder if it will make the market. Lunch as usual with the coworkers. I eat a caprese salad and strawberries. We made the mistake of trying to eat outside, and it's weirdly warm for this time of the year — about 95-degrees F. We are all sweaty and leave lunch early. 1 p.m. — Calling it a day on my juice experiments. I switch to a different project and focus on taking chemistry readings for new beverage products. Each sample takes about six minutes, and there are 20 of them. Great. 4 p.m. — Done with work! I rush to get gas since it's cheaper in the suburbs, especially since the price increased after the hurricane. From there, I head to my dad's house; my graduate school classes are online and if I took the train, I'd miss the beginning of each lesson. Luckily, my dad lives close to my job so I can mooch off his Wi-Fi. I can do laundry, too; each load is $3 at my apartment. $20.67 4:45 p.m. — Sneak in a quick run before class and reach my step goal! 7 p.m. — Class let out early because no one had any questions. I'm working toward a master's degree in food science and human nutrition, and this class is on food process engineering. I like learning again after having taken a break, but it's not the easiest thing to balance work and school. I try to be productive since class finished early; I schedule a haircut, fold my laundry, shower, and start my homework. I start watching while waiting for my dad to get home. 7:45 p.m. — My dad gets home and brings the best warm weather dinner! We cook Japanese cha soba, or cold noodles. I love getting to eat with my parents because they feed me all the delicious, traditional Japanese food my boyfriend doesn't like to eat. (A sad side effect of being in an interracial couple.) With dinner over, I hit the road full of food and clean clothes. Traffic is almost nonexistent late at night, so I blast Imagine Dragons and go to bed when I get home. Daily Total: $20.67",3,213
"5:30 a.m. — Same wakeup and morning routine: eggs for breakfast with strawberry water. Listen to the podcast as I walk to the train. 7:45 a.m. — It's the hottest day  — 96F — and I have to work in our plant. This translates to wearing steel-toed shoes, hair nets, and working in 90F and high humidity. Here's to hoping I finish my project so I can get out of here. 12 p.m. — I've never been so grateful for cold water and air conditioning. I eat lunch (delicious Annie's White Cheddar Mac and Cheese and strawberries that I brought from home) with the usual suspects. One of my friends just got back from an offsite trial and brought tacos and granola for everyone! I love the food industry. 1 p.m. — LIFE CHANGED! I hear back from a company I interviewed with almost three months ago. They offer me a full-time food scientist position! This is a huge step up from my contracting position, but I start thinking about how I love the job I'm already in. Oh well — is it appropriate to happy dance in the office? 6 p.m. — I get home in the mood to celebrate, but my boyfriend is going out to dinner with his friend. So, I cook dinner for myself and a friend. On my walk home from the train, I pick up a fresh baguette and a celebratory bottle of Champagne from Whole Foods. Quickly squeeze in a yoga class; sometimes I free flow, but I'm so excited that I watch one of Morgan Tyler's YouTube videos to keep my mind focused. $21.83 7:30 p.m. — My friend comes over and surprises me with another bottle of Champagne! Champagne (or sparkling wine) is my favorite; I even did my undergrad senior thesis on the chemistry of it. Together, my friend and I cook shakshuka and make a salad. We spend the rest of the night eating and catching up. It's nice to have some girl time with friends at home, something that can be difficult since I live with my boyfriend, and she has roommates. 10:30 p.m. — A little wine tipsy, but we manage to do the dishes before my friend heads home. I'm so excited that it's hard to fall asleep. Daily Total: $21.83",4,213
"5:30 a.m. — The excitement from yesterday's news has me up without hitting snooze. I get ready as usual and eat some leftover shakshuka for breakfast. My cat also decided to steal the baguette from yesterday, so I spend time running around the apartment with my boyfriend chasing the kitty. The kitty is surprisingly protective of the baguette, so we decide to let him keep the bread because we don't want to wrestle him for it. 7:45 a.m. — Work is always quiet on Friday mornings. I take this time to put the coffee on for everyone else, and when it's done I make an iced coffee. It's not the best, but it beats having to leave work and pay for Starbucks. It's still quiet, so I check my emails and read theSkimm. 8:30 a.m. — My manager says we don't have enough information from my juice experiments. Back at it again! Hopefully this works because I want this to be completed before the weekend. 12 p.m. — Lunch with the gang again. I bring the last of the shakshuka but it doesn't fill me up, so I make a salad at our cafeteria's salad bar. My coworkers and I share weekend plans, and I invite them to go wine tasting with me and a few friends tonight. $3.11 3 p.m. — Finally finish my juice project — but I can't leave early because I told my coworkers I'd wait for them so we can all take the train together. I keep myself busy reading BBC and checking emails. 6:35 p.m. — The train finally gets into the station. There were signal failures, and we end up nearly an hour late. We speed-walk to meet my boyfriend and our friends for a five-after-5 wine tasting. Since I brought my wine glass from the last time, I save $1 on the tasting! $6.53 7:30 p.m. — Wine tasting is fun and delicious, and it's even better with coworkers since we are all in food science. We're the nerds arguing over processing techniques and which chemical components complement which ingredients best. 9 p.m. — Somehow, I end up hanging out with my coworkers, even though I was supposed to go to Oktoberfest with my boyfriend and our friends. One of the gang suggests we try a tequila cocktail he invented, so he buys all the ingredients and tequila and we are all back at my apartment. Shots! 10:30 p.m. — I get tricked into an Uber that takes us to Fulton Market. I wanted to get a cheap burger and fries, but my coworker knows the chef and insists that we can get a free meal. Instead of trying Michelin-starred food, the night starts to go horribly wrong. I notice some people have left, two people get sick, and I end up taking care of them. 12 a.m. — My friend and I finally get everyone into Ubers and are satisfied that people will get home safely. She has plans with other friends and heads out, but I realize that I haven't eaten anything since lunch; with a stomach full of drinks, I just need food. I grab a Lyft back to my apartment. $5.37 1 a.m. — I'm starving, but arrive home to a wreck. I must look as frazzled as I feel, because my boyfriend and our friend who came over sit me down and make ramen. They're a little tipsy from Oktoberfest, but they know I've had a night so they let me relax and watch . I don't even know when I fall asleep. Daily Total: $15.01",5,213
"8 a.m. — Why can't I ever sleep in after drinking? I feel pretty hungover but my boyfriend and I have plans with friends. I shower, get ready, and start cleaning up yesterday's mess. 10 a.m. — Yes! Our plans get pushed back to 10:30. I run to Dunkin' Donuts to grab a breakfast sandwich. I need something greasy for this headache. After last night, I feel super grateful for my boyfriend, so I grab him one too. Then I run across the street to use my free Starbucks reward to get an iced chai. $7.78 12:30 p.m. — We're going on a trip out of the city to go apple picking! It's one of my favorite fall activities, and even though it's hot outside, we decide that we need to go. We spend the day picking apples; I grab mostly Honeycrisp. For a snack, we buy apple cider donuts and cider slushies. After finally cooling down, we all head to the corn maze and try not to get lost. $32 4 p.m. — Headed home but we pass by an Oberweis and can't pass it without stopping; it's about 95 after all! I grab an ice cream topped with Oreos, and we all work on pictures we want to post on Instagram. $4.28 6 p.m. — Back at home and my body is exhausted! I don't know how, but my boyfriend decides to go to the gym. My friend and I catch up and play in the background. As soon as my boyfriend gets back, we go to Chipotle for much-needed salty food. I get a burrito bowl and chips and guac to share. The three of us settle in for a movie night — it is! $12.06 10 p.m. — ends, and we're all asleep on the couch. Who knew that apple picking was so tiring? My friend calls an Uber home, and we head to bed. Daily Total: $56.12",6,213
"8:30 a.m. — I seriously can't sleep in anymore since I have to wake up so early for work. I give up trying to snooze and get up to play with the kitty. He's a bit mad at me for bringing over so many people on Friday night, so I ply him with treats and toys, making sure he doesn't feel neglected. 10 a.m. — My boyfriend is up and showered; we make our meal plan for the week and head to the supermarket. We like to plan our meals ahead of time so we don't waste food, and don't end up running around last minute looking for specific ingredients. At Mariano's, we buy red peppers, lettuce, tomatoes, zucchini, carrots, salmon, mozzarella, gouda, bread, eggs, and milk. I'm always surprised by the total of groceries ($51.57), but we put it on our joint card that we split the bill for. $25.79 12 p.m. — Make it back in time for football kickoff! We fall into our usual routine: my boyfriend watches football, and since I know he can't multitask, I make us a lunch of caprese sausage and avocado toast topped with fried eggs. After, I tidy up the apartment and start on my homework for class next week. 3:30 p.m. — Game's over. Lions lose, but the Bears win — so at least one of us is happy! We head to REI to look at tents for our camping trip. We also want to look at backpacks for a future backpacking trip, but we decide to take baby steps. The one we like the most is more expensive than we budgeted for, so we decided to wait and do more research before purchasing anything. 6:30 p.m. — I make dinner while my boyfriend watches more football. We eat a zucchini noodle pesto with some mozzarella and tomatoes. I toast ciabatta bread and feed the kitty. I finally convince my boyfriend that he has watched enough football for the day, and we eat while watching an episode of . We pack the leftovers for tomorrow's lunch and then finish the night by making mug cookies. Daily Total: $25.79",7,213
"8:30 a.m. — Hooray, Saturday! My husband and I wake up as the sun fills our bedroom, and I amble over to the kitchen to turn on our espresso machine. I pull two perfect shots, and take my probiotic supplement. We sip espresso in bed and play with our parrot, Ancho, who loves to snuggle with us in the morning. I grew up having lots of birds, and I love how parrots express so much curiosity and personality (but I also love dogs!). Ancho is a three-year-old rescue parrot whom we got six months ago, and he's pretty much the center of our universe. Reluctantly, we head out to the gym. 10:30 a.m. — Back in our apartment, we each have another espresso, and my husband packs us a picnic while I'm in the shower. We have a perch in the bathroom for Ancho from which he sings and chatters while we shower. He's not a talented melodist, but he's extremely enthusiastic and loves to sing along with our off-key shower songs. We get ready to leave, and turn on NPR on our Amazon Alexa so that Ancho has some “company.” 12 p.m. — Our traditional warm-weather Saturday routine involves walking to our neighborhood farmer's market before going to picnic at an amazing, hidden-gem rooftop farm/farm stand in Long Island City. As we approach the farmer's market, I notice a very tall man thronged by people near the apple stand: it's Bill de Blasio, the mayor of NYC. Our local city councilperson recognizes us and motions us over to talk to the mayor. He is extremely tall; I suddenly forget all my hard-hitting questions, and we talk about tomato sauce. Good thing I didn't go into journalism! At the rooftop farm, we buy a loaf of bread and Szechuan buttons, because they sound intriguing. (They're unrelated to Szechuan peppercorns but produce the same numbing, tingling effect on the palate.) We mosey over to the big picnic table and set out our spread: a variety of cheeses, olive oil, pickles, fresh figs, and a bottle of white wine. This is one of our absolute favorite spots in all of New York, with a sweet view of the skyline. $8 2:30 p.m. — Now that we're stuffed with almost an entire large loaf of bread and an obscene amount of cheese, we take a long walk to the Astoria waterfront. First stop: Socrates Sculpture Park, where they've just opened a new installation. Right next to Socrates is our next stop, Costco, my absolute favorite store. They carry everything, their workers are paid a fair wage and get solid benefits, their margins are unbelievably low, and you can get an entire wheel of Humboldt Fog cheese for an amazing bargain. When the apocalypse comes, I'll make a Costco my bunker. I can also get in and out of Costco in under 30 minutes; I've been to so many that I know the layout really well. We pick up a giant bag of popcorn, decongestant (cold season, ugh), olive oil, and an enormous hunk of Parmesan, which will disappear surprisingly quickly in our household. $56 3:30 p.m. — We stop by the liquor store adjacent to Costco to buy a bottle of prosecco to bring to a friend's housewarming, and end up partaking in some wine tastings. $11.97 4 p.m. — The housewarming is about two miles away in Long Island City; we decide to walk since it's still so nice out. My friend's apartment has an unbelievable view of Roosevelt Island and Manhattan, and the sun is sparkling on the East River. We admire the skyline and congratulate my friend on the amazing vista. We take the subway back home (I had money on my MetroCard) to drop off our groceries and say hi to Ancho; we feel bad about leaving him alone all Saturday! Ancho is my husband's first bird and they are completely obsessed with each other; we play with him for a little while and practice the new trick my husband has taught him: We say “boop” and Ancho taps our noses; it's the cutest thing. 7 p.m. — After drinking a glass of wine at home, we stop at the ATM to take out cash, and then head out on the subway to Corona to meet a friend at the Queens International Night Market, another one of our favorite Saturday activities. There are so many new vendors! I am overwhelmed. We queue in a very-long-but-worth-it line for Burmese Bites while we wait for our friend to join us. I get some for us to share, and we end up getting so many more things, including Peruvian ceviche, Siberian pelmeni, a Nigerian rice bowl, and Szechuan buns; we take turns buying. My husband and our friend drink beers, and we watch a professional yo-yo artist performing for the crowd with puzzlement. $15 9 p.m. — We're so full. My husband and I take the subway home and hang out with Ancho before putting him to bed and tidying up around the apartment. We watch the first few episodes of on Netflix (this show is amazing, seriously) and then go to bed around midnight. Daily Total: $90.97",1,214
"10 a.m. — My husband brings us espressos to drink in bed, and I take Ancho out of his cage so we can play. He's chatty in the morning and we are trying to decipher what he's saying, but I'm not fluent in parrot yet. I hate when other people say this, but I'm too full from last night's gorging to eat breakfast. We do some cleaning around the house, and I catch up on some of the freelance editing work that I do as a side hustle. I can do it from home on my own schedule, which is awesome, and I enjoy the work; it's seasonal, and the busy period is ramping up. I negotiated a 25% raise on my hourly rate last year, so it's a great use of my spare time and talents. 1 p.m. — I brew a giant cup of rooibos and make myself beautiful tartines from yesterday's bread with lox, capers, and a fried egg. After my shower, I start doing my multi-step skincare routing from Fifty Shades of Snail and then get sucked into an internet research hole about skincare products. I started reading about Korean skincare a few years ago, and I'm a product junkie; I order a new face mask from Amazon. After I detach myself from the computer, I catch up on all the reading I need to do! I subscribe to 14 magazines and am part of two book clubs, so I have lots of material to cover. I finish last week's New Yorker and start reading Ellen Pao's book, . Ancho helps by chewing the corners of my pages and snuggling in my hair. $10.99 6 p.m. — I bought tickets to a supper club pop-up a few weeks ago, and our date is tonight! Since the weather is still lovely, we opt to walk the two miles to Brooklyn. I wasn't going to drink tonight, but it's hard to say no to purchasing the carafe of rosé our host chef is offering, now that we're in the presence of heavenly-smelling food. The chef brings out dish after dish of amazing Korean food, and we chat with the other couple who reserved seats at the pop-up tonight. We wanted to talk more with our host about cooking and cuisine, but it's hard to shift the conversation. We vow to come back! (This is a no-tipping establishment, so I pay for the wine and food sans tip.) $8.50 9:30 p.m. — My husband pays for the uberPOOL home; we put Ancho to bed and prepare for our mornings. A bunch of the eBay listings I put up ended up selling (another one of my side hustles), so I pack up the items and print out shipping labels. After fees and shipping, I end up netting $130. Nice! Daily Total: $19.49",2,214
"5:30 a.m. — After groggily hitting snooze my alarm once, I get dressed and drag myself to the gym. The exercise wakes me up and energizes me for the week ahead, but it's hard to get up this early! When I get home around 7, I make espresso and bring my husband his cup in bed (along with Ancho). Ancho and I hop into the shower, and then I get ready for work. Luckily, I have enough time for breakfast, so I make myself a smoothie bowl (soy milk, frozen banana, frozen spinach, frozen berries, collagen powder, maca powder) topped with the last of the fresh figs, dried goji berries, cacao nibs, my homemade granola, almonds, and coconut flakes. Ancho steals pieces of almond as I eat. I quickly brush my teeth and gather my things to leave. 8:30 a.m. — On most non-rainy mornings, I ride my bike to work. It's the fastest mode of transportation and I enjoy the exercise. Work is fairly quiet today; I have a few meetings lined up today and a bunch of emails to tackle. 12 p.m. — I bike home for lunch, a quick salad with produce we have in the fridge. I also grab my eBay packages and stop by the post office before biking back to the office. The day is lovely! 6 p.m. — I bike home; my husband is making grain bowls for dinner tonight. He's an excellent chef, and we cook at home most nights. We have the kitchen gadgets and love learning about food. There's amazing smelling rice cooking in our Zojirushi, and he has five-spice pork loin cooking in our Anova sous-vide rig. I quickly pickle radishes and nibble at the sautéed mushrooms. After we eat dinner and prepare our lunches for tomorrow with the leftovers, we take Ancho out to play. 10:30 p.m. — We watch an episode of (my husband pays for Netflix), and then head to bed.

"5:40 a.m. — Snooze through my gym alarm twice, but make it there by 6:15. I'm not feeling very hungry this morning, so once I get home, I just have a big cup of genmaicha tea and my probiotic. Ancho sings through our showers and I get ready for work, then head out on my bike. 10:15 a.m. — Gilt City is offering a voucher to a new restaurant we've been dying to try! I buy it since we were going to eat there anyway. $45 11 a.m. — My mom has an emergency expense come up; I lend her $5,000 from my savings account and she says she'll be able to pay me back in a few weeks. I lent her a much larger sum last year and it took her a year to pay me back (no interest, of course), so I sense I won't get the money back for a little while. I check my accounts and see I will be okay. I've been saving since I was 14! $5,000 5 p.m. — I bike home, still chilly. I've been getting fundraising calls from my undergrad alma mater for weeks and haven't been picking up; I go online and donate $100 to their new financial aid campaign. $100 7 p.m. — I make dinner, play with Ancho, and read — a pretty quiet night. I notice I have Amazon music credits in my account and decide to buy a new album. We go to bed around 11 p.m. $1.49 Daily Total: $5,146.49",4,214
"7:30 a.m. — I'm at an offsite for work today and tomorrow, so I need to reload my MetroCard and brave the commuting crowds into Manhattan. I read by Ann Patchett on the ride and am totally engrossed. Walking through the Union Square Greenmarket once I get off the subway is intoxicating; I love the smell of fresh produce. I make it to the offsite early and hooray, there is free breakfast! $26.20 12 p.m. — We break for lunch and it is an amazing catered spread: scallops, steak, a beautiful gourmet salad, creamy pesto pasta, potatoes, roasted vegetables. I overstuff myself and go back for more scallops. I can eat unlimited quantities of free food. 6 p.m. — Our work is done for the day, and we head to a rooftop happy hour with breathtaking views of New York, and more amazing catering! This group of coworkers is fun; I drink several glasses of rosé because the bartender is awesome and the weather is still rosé-lovely. We all gossip for a few hours; I fill up on chicken satay and stuffed mushrooms. I become a stuffed mushroom. 8:30 p.m. — The group is headed to another bar, but I decide to head home to finish up a presentation I need to file by tomorrow. On my way home, I engage in some impulse shopping, inspired by the rosé. I use the PayPal funds from my Sunday night selling to purchase a new sweater, which was $50, but is technically free because I never transferred the funds to my bank account. Once I finish up my presentation around 10, I contentedly fall into bed after taking care of Ancho; husband is at a podcast taping and comes home a bit later. Daily Total: $26.20",5,214
"5:40 a.m. — I'm a little too tired for the gym this morning so I give myself a break and snooze an extra hour. I usually go five days a week but this week's schedule has thrown me off a bit. Once I'm up and dressed, I take the subway into Manhattan for day two of the offsite; commuters seem especially grumpy this morning. 8:45 a.m. — Free breakfast! Everyone looks extremely hungover and I am regaled with tales of the group's shenanigans: they ended up being filmed for a reality show that was taping at the bar they went to after our “official” happy hour, scarfed down drunk pizza, and had a hot mess of a night. It sounds super fun but I had to finish my presentation! 1 p.m. — Another fantastic catered lunch spread, and I totally overeat again, but no regrets. The food is too good and there is an enormous red velvet cake for dessert. After lunch, I take the subway back to the office to clean up my presentation. 5 p.m. — I definitely need the walk home because I'm still in food catatonia, and I'll save myself the subway fare. Ancho is so glad to see me! I'm still so full from lunch that I can tell I won't want to eat a real dinner meal. 6 p.m. — My mom calls and says we should pick up a tree from her apartment to take to our place; it's an eight-food-tall fiddle leaf and so beautiful, but it doesn't fit her space. We walk to her house and lug it back to our apartment with a hand truck. We already have a fiddle leaf, but it's extremely temperamental, and this one is amazingly healthy. 8 p.m. — Husband and I take the bus to a concert in Williamsburg I bought tickets to a few weeks ago. This performer is an amazing artist and his social anxiety really endears him to me. We have a great time, and don't buy any drinks because it's challenging to go hard two nights in a row. When the concert ends, we take an uberPool home; my husband pays. We crawl into bed a little after midnight. Daily Total: $0",6,214
"5:30 a.m. — I optimistically set my gym alarm last night but it's clear that I am not going to make it, so I get to sleep for another 90 minutes. On my bike to work, I feel totally refreshed. Just needed some cool air and sunshine! 1 p.m. — There's free lunch in the office kitchen left over from an event. I scarf down soggy salad, eat a few nice sandwiches at my desk, then quickly jet home to drop off my bike. I am delighted to receive a $53 check in the mail from my freelance work and immediately mobile deposit it before bidding Ancho adieu, grabbing a bottle of Pinot Noir from our wine cabinet (for an evening event), and walking back to the office. 5:30 p.m. — Husband meets me at my office to take a long walk to Williamsburg for my friend's going-away party in a terrific outdoor space. The weather is still lovely, and we have a great time drinking wine and eating the most incredible cheeseburgers made with dry-aged beef. (My friend and their partner were both butchers.) Husband and I cannot stop raving about the burgers and eat two each, though they are enormous. We discuss the merits of different types of burger buns with my friend and agree that old-fashioned potato rolls are the best option and brioche rolls are overrated. (Fight me!) The party is bittersweet but still a great time. 9:30 p.m. — We stop by one of our favorite wine stores in the area to buy a few biodynamic wines. Wine shopping is hard when you drink a lot of wine, but we need to restock our wine cabinet and this store has a lot of unusual selections. I get a red vinho verde (yeah, I know: an oxymoron) and an unusual Italian wine. $46 10 p.m. — We take the bus home, and undertake the task of removing our AC unit from the window so that we can put it into storage tomorrow morning. We feel pretty accomplished about this, and after playing with Ancho for a little bit, we put him and ourselves to bed. Daily Total: $46",7,214
"7 a.m. — I have three alarms set to irritate me out of bed; I snooze them all. I get home late on Sunday nights from weekend climbing trips, so Mondays are not my favorite. I rush to the bathroom to wash my face and dab a tincture of castor oil, lavender, tea tree, cedar wood, and niaouli. I check the weather while putting on mascara and eyeshadow; I don't wear foundation. If there's an especially pulsating pimple, I'll use concealer, but my face and wallet prefer bare skin. I slip on a dress and denim jacket and I'm out the door. 8:30 a.m. — I drink green tea and eat homemade granola that I baked for the week. (Mash four bananas and mix in three-fourths of a cup of peanut butter, one teaspoon of vanilla, one or two tablespoons of honey, one or two tablespoons of cinnamon, two or three cups of rolled oats. I eyeball it and add cranberries and/or chopped dates, almonds, sunflower, chia, and flaxseed. Bake at 375 degrees for 20 to 25 minutes. Voila! It can be bars, balls, or a crumble.) 12:30 p.m. — I go home to eat because I didn't meal prep lunches before I left for the weekend like I usually do. (I try not to eat out more than once a week.) I spy a soup can that was reserved for camping, but since one of my friends loves cooking while we camp (last weekend we had quesadilla burgers and burrito omelets), the soup can hasn't left the shelf. Speaking of which, I need to Venmo him gas money. I do that, eat the soup and carrot sticks, and watch until it's time to return to work. $10 6 p.m. — I meal prep this week's lunches by making my staple of zucchini, bell peppers, chickpeas, cannellini beans, black beans, tomatoes, spinach, garlic, and taco seasoning all in one pot. I top it with couscous and place everything in five lunch containers. For this week's dinners, I roast cauliflower with the leftover taco seasoning, and sweet potatoes with chili pepper and cinnamon. 8:30 p.m. — Rest day means it's time to watch . Martin Freeman's surprising accent makes me want a Scotsman. I text a friend and we talk about the guy she's dating and the guy I'm interested in. She warns me to find a guy who cuddles, because her current beau is not a fan of snuggling. If I'm with a guy, you better believe the Holy Spirit won't find room between us. Daily Total: $10",1,215
"6:45 a.m. — I wake up before my alarm; no bueno. I close my eyes for 10 minutes and then jump when my alarm rings. I do the same quick ritual in the morning and pack my bag with breakfast granola, lunch and carrot sticks, and the Netflix return envelope. I pretend my dirty climbing and camping gear aren't lying by my front door. 9 a.m. — My boss comes in with pumpkin donut holes; divine! We are foodies and enjoy swapping recipes and finds at Aldi. I wait until I digest my granola, and have a donut. 12 p.m. — It's a slow day and I'm on my fourth donut hole in five minutes. I try to focus on work, but I'm thinking about a guy I like, B. I think there's a mutual attraction, but he's preoccupied with work that could potentially have him move out of state so I understand if he's hesitant and overwhelmed. 1:15 p.m. — I find a quiet spot at one of the campus coffee shops and eat while reading Arno Ilgner's . When I began climbing, I didn't realize how applicable the sport was to developing a well-rounded life. You learn to trust yourself and your partner, become courageous and vulnerable, problem solve and calculate risks, respond to failure, and so much more. The downside to climbing is that the gear is expensive, and I won't be able to invest in my own rack until next year when I have fewer expenses. Thank you to my friends for sharing. 5:30 p.m. — I eat dinner. I'm surprised at how filling the cauliflower and sweet potatoes are. Vegetables as comfort food? Apparently, it is possible. 6:30 p.m. — I should be climbing, but I'm stuck socializing. My climbing partner and I chat with B. and some other folks at the boulder wall. B. and I steal glances amid particles of chalk and laboring grunts (at least I think we do) while we talk about climbing injuries. We're masochistic creatures. 9 p.m. — I unpack and decide to repack my gear for the upcoming weekend. I spent a couple hundred dollars on camping gear, but when my finances started getting really tight a few months ago, I returned the expensive gear and found affordable replacements on Amazon. I should've bargain shopped beforehand. REI and Backcountry, you are my weaknesses. Daily Total: $0",2,215
"8:30 a.m. — I let my boss know I'm no longer taking Thursday and Friday off. I was going to be a roadie for friends who are doing a 24-hour climbing competition in Arkansas, but with a major car repair coming up costing between $1,000-$1,200, I decide not to go. I paid the entrance fee ($45) two months ago which is a bummer, but considering meals and gas, I'm still saving money. I feel bad disappointing my gal pals. We've been stoked about this competition for months, but I've had reservations about going for a few weeks and decide to listen to my gut and save the money. 1:15 p.m. — I'm about to nosh on my prepped lunch and carrots. You'd think repetition gets old but if it's good, who cares? Normally, I meal prep two weeks' worth of lunches (five in the fridge and five in the freezer) and use spices and different vegetable combos for variety. I'm not a vegetarian or vegan. Meat is just too expensive, so I save that for when I eat out. 4:30 p.m. — Off to the gym for Alpine Fit. Climb Nashville is amazing: It's $70 per month, which is steep for me, but that includes climbing, fitness, and yoga classes. The membership is automatically charged to my credit card at the end of each month, and yet it always surprises me. Sometimes I think I need to get a side hustle. Work, work, work? Nope. I'd rather be frugal so I can have my free time. 7 p.m. — Oh, boy. Alpine Fit was physical torture, but there's so much adrenaline rushing through my cherry-red face, I won't feel the pain until tomorrow. Along with this physical misery, there was mental misery — about B., I have no clue how this man feels about me. We worked out. He crushed. I crashed. We chatted, making plans for the weekend, making plans to lead climb tomorrow with friends. Then, he realized he's supposed to have dinner with colleagues; we part ways with him saying, “It was nice seeing you.” Okay... I feel like I'm in a '90s rom-com. 10 p.m. — After a much needed shower, I heat up my cauliflower and sweet potatoes and watch . I fall asleep once the episode finishes and then wake up to the incredibly luminous lamp above me. I pack my climbing gear and lunch bag, and then brush my teeth and fall into bed. I read my devotional and have speaks with God. I like B., but if there is something there, I deserve to feel some sort of reciprocated desire. I don't need to invest in romantic feelings if we're just going to be friends. Amen. Daily Total: $0",3,215
"9 a.m. — Five people ask if I'm okay. Maybe it's the wavy mess of hair because I couldn't brush it, or the heating pad bunched on my shoulder. Either way, it's all due to Alpine — and climbing tonight will be a feat. Someone better take pity and offer a massage. I never pay for massages because I have kind friends and return the favor. Hey, massage train! Nominal means equals bartering services. 11:20 a.m. — I'm reviewing my bank account. I'm better off than most, but I despise not having a bigger savings cushion. I moved to Nashville over a year ago and had some massive expenses — moving from Florida, hefty rent, paying off student loans, medical bills from a badly sprained ankle, freak car issues (new rear brakes, flat tire, cracked windshield, broken coolant fan, and now I need a new water pump and timing belt so my car doesn't explode at 100,000 miles). So, I need to figure out how to cover rent, a major car repair, and traveling to a bouldering comp in North Carolina that's in a few weeks. Ode to the stresses of money. Thank goodness I'm moving in with a friend in mid-December, and my expenses will be nearly cut in half. Hurray for growing that savings account. 2:05 p.m. — Pop-Tart break. $0.86 5:15 p.m. — B. and I stretch with friends before jumping on the lead wall. We're both tight from Alpine. I joke about needing a massage, but no one takes the bait. As a warm-up, B. starts us on a 5.10 . How dare he think that's a warm-up? A miracle occurs and I sent the sucker clean. The whole evening is going really well: the climbing, the camaraderie. What's even more interesting is how B. and I are acting together. We're really comfortable and say “we” and “us” like we're an item; this rom-com is taking a turn for the better. 9 p.m. — I got sucked into the climbing gym time warp. Finally, I'm home and full of energy; I wash my hair (something I do twice a week with baking soda, water, and rosemary essential oil and a tar shampoo — no oiliness for days!), do laundry, run the dishwasher, make a grocery list for tomorrow, meal prep next week's lunches (sautéed sweet potatoes, diced tomatoes, cannellini beans, black beans, chickpeas and brussels sprouts with turmeric, garlic powder, chili pepper, lemon pepper, and salt and pepper in coconut oil). Heat up dinner and watch . 12:15 a.m. — Bed. Devotional. Crash. Daily Total: $0.86",4,215
"6:50 a.m. — I get out of bed anticipating my muscles to seize, but the old body is holding up pretty well. I debate whether to wear Chacos because my feet are sore from standing at my desk all week in flat sandals. I like to alternate between sitting and standing so I don't become one with my desk chair. I gather my lunch and grocery bags for my trip to Aldi after work and head out. 9:50 a.m. — Yep, I should've worn my Chacos. My heels ache. 12:30 p.m. — Time for my delicious lunch and carrot sticks. Tonight, I'm hanging out with friends and I hope we order pizza. I'm craving bread and cheese, and I'm also PMSing and dealing with a pinball game going on in my uterus and ovaries. 3:45 p.m. — Pop-Tart break. $0.86 5 p.m. — I'm at Aldi, the best grocery store ever. I buy two weeks' worth of groceries that can sometimes stretch to three weeks if I meal prep and get very creative. I get two bunches of bananas, apples, nectarines, sweet potatoes, cauliflower, broccoli, tomatoes, onions, mushrooms, two packages of zucchini and bell peppers, carrots, tortillas, two cans of chickpeas, cannellini beans, black beans, diced tomatoes, butter, dried mango and cranberries, honey, peppermint tea, two boxes of couscous, vanilla, oats, sunflower seeds, almonds, two dozen eggs and moscato. $67.54 7 p.m. — On the way to hang out with friends, I get gas and air one of my tires. $29.85 9 p.m. — My friend and I are two glasses in on his phenomenal Hungarian Malbec while we decide where to eat. We walk 10 minutes to a Chicago-style pizzeria where we meet up with friends. I split a 16-inch spinach garlic thin crust and eat some of my friends' chicken and pesto pizza, too. Oh, the goodness in my belly. $12.38 Daily Total: $110.63",5,215
"9 a.m. — It's been weeks since I last slept in on a Saturday, and it's much needed. I review my accounts and see that my bimonthly paycheck has gone through. There's just enough in my checking to cover rent next week, so I transfer $50 from my savings for a buffer. I also transfer $250 from my savings to pay a portion of my credit card balance. I'll have to transfer more after I get my car fixed, too. It's frustrating chiseling away at my savings, but bills must be paid. I'll build it up after I move. $250 12:45 p.m. — A girlfriend and I head to Percy Priest Lake. It may be the beginning of fall, but it's 90 degrees outside and gorgeous. We stop by a gas station to pick up treats — Mike's Hard Lemonade and Doritos. She pays because she's amazing and knows I'm trying to save money; also, I'm driving. 5:30 p.m. — We spend all day gabbing, laying out, and rotating in the water to maintain an even tan. It was such a peaceful rest day with her. We've only known each other for a few months, but we've really hit it off. I've been fortunate with the friends I've made in Nashville. Most of us are transplants and actively looking for a surrogate family. This city, and especially Climb Nashville, are definitely the friendliest places I've ever known. 10 p.m. — It's an early night for me because B. and I are heading out to climb in the morning. I get ready for bed, have my devotional, and sleep time. Daily Total: $250",6,215
"7 a.m. — I didn't sleep much because I was too excited. I really want to climb without falling or freaking on my project route (Christine, 10a). I know the moves, but there's one part that gets in my head and I freeze on the wall with indecision. Not today! I eat an egg burrito while changing and gathering my gear. B. arrives and we're off. 10:15 a.m. — We're at Obed, my home away from home. We go to South Clear where our projects are located and hopefully intercept our friends who arrived last night. B. warms-up on Spawn (10b/c), a route that I have a history of antipathy with because it was the highest and hardest route I was thrown on as a beginner. Out of stubbornness, I top rope the stupid route and actually enjoy myself. What the heck!? 11 a.m. — Our friends find us. Some of us move to Solstice (12a), B.'s project and I become the “belay bitch” (yes, it's an affectionate term, and not reserved for only women) to B. and a friend who are both incredibly strong climbers. They alternate climbing and then give me a catch, and I barely make it to the second bolt. I'm in awe of their abilities. 1 p.m. — Christine, we meet again. I lasso B. to belay me. He gives me confidence and great instruction. I'm taking my time, breathing, and then I hit the crux and spend too much time worrying instead of doing. B. yells up, “Stop dancing around and move!” My arms are so pumped. I try to shift over the prowl, but my grip is not holding and my worst fear happens; I take a big whipper accompanied by a scream that I never knew could come out of my mouth. My friends whoop and holler because taking a whipper means you did your hardest and went for it. I jug back up to the crux and I'm amped to make another go, but then my body begins to shake uncontrollably. All that adrenaline made me feel unstable and I ask to be lowered. I quietly sit down. B. comes over and talks to me while untying my figure eight. If I didn't let my head get in the way, I could've easily made that move. It's another obstacle I need to conquer but I'm glad I finally went for the move and let myself fall. Next time. 7 p.m. — After a long day of climbing, we follow tradition and go to Romo's Mexican Restaurant. We're a lovely group of gross climbers who smell of sweat, dirt, and bug spray. I pay B.'s and my bill since he drove. $22.35 10:15 p.m. — On the way home, I debate whether to ask B. if there's a mutual attraction. We're very comfortable with one another and I see a spark, but he hasn't initiated anything and I think he's the kind of guy who would. We arrive at my place, he turns off the car and we hug goodbye. I walk away smiling. I'm not going to let my impatience get the better of me — nor am I going to carry a torch for him. If he asks me out, I'll definitely say yes. But if we're just going to be friends, I'm glad for that, too. Daily Total: $22.35",7,215
"6:30 a.m. — It's been two days since the fires in Sonoma and Napa Counties started. I wake up and check the fire map. Some sections have grown but the largest ones have stalled a little. I'm a little relieved, there are also no new fires near us. I read all the news and check websites for volunteer needs. I know a lot of people who live in Santa Rosa and Napa, and my friends have a messaging group to update each other on our situations. I drove up last night to stay with my boyfriend in Petaluma. I check my work email, but everything is okay for now. 7:30 a.m. — My boyfriend gets back from work and surprises me with breakfast burritos in bed; he is so sweet. He starts work at 7, but came back because a bunch of jobs were canceled (construction) and he wanted to volunteer today. 8:40 a.m. — We get to the volunteer center early; they open at 9. We registered online yesterday, and now fill out a health form and sit around until we get called for an interview. They ask about our health, ability to work 12-hour shifts, and what kind of volunteering we'd like to do. Then we wait for a group training at 11. It's a long time to wait and I wish I'd brought a book! We see a bunch of staff from my boyfriend's climbing gym. All the younger folks in the room are trying to crack jokes and be silly, myself included. It's nice because otherwise we'd be sitting in a room worried about the fires. There is a good mix of people of all ages in the room waiting. 10:30 a.m. — We run out to get a veggie patty sub to split from Subway for lunch later. Everything goes in except pickles and pepperoncini. I love pickled things, but only in isolation. I pay, since he bought our burritos yesterday. $7.93 12 p.m. — I find the group training presentation useful but my boyfriend thinks it's pretty common sense. Oh well; we get laminated name tags at the end and a link to volunteering opportunities at different shelters. We sign up for the next shift at 12:45 p.m. to 7 p.m. in Santa Rosa. 12:50 p.m. — There has been an outpouring of donations and volunteers in the area, so they tell us we might be sitting around a bit. Undeterred, we go off to try to help. We bounce around helping serve food and cleaning chairs, doors, rails, etc., but everywhere is well staffed and we feel a bit useless. We do see the donation section overflowing, and decide to get to work helping to sort clothing into different sections. After wearing masks for a few hours (since we're working outside), I tell my boyfriend that I've gained an intimate understanding of how my breath smells now. He replies that he loves me. (I love him too.) A few people come by to get clothes and we help them out. We listen to their stories, as much or as little as they want to share. Interacting with the folks affected makes it feel so worthwhile. I used to want to be a counselor growing up, and this makes me think I should do more regular volunteering. 6:30 p.m. — We leave a little early; there seem to be plenty of volunteers and we've sorted the majority of the clothing donations, so we don't feel bad. My boyfriend tells me he wants to get chili from Amy's Drive-Thru and animal fries from In-N-Out (they are next door to each other) to combine into the ultimate chili cheese fries. We discuss it, but laziness wins out and he agrees to just get chili cheese fries from Amy's. $4.66 8 p.m. — When we get back to his place, we eat it with all the leftovers we have and watch . Leftovers include half a burrito, roasted veggies, black bean burger mash, and smoky baba ganoush with crackers. (I cooked the last three and he bought the burrito.) 9 p.m. — My boyfriend's parents tell us we'll be hosting evacuee friends tonight, and we help clean a little. They're bringing cats with them but there's already a refugee kitty in the computer room; the outdoor shed is prepped for the new cats though, so they won't need to be in the same space. I debate going home or staying over tonight. Instead of deciding, we cuddle up for the next few hours, and pass out early, before 10 p.m. Daily Total: $12.59",1,216
"6:05 a.m. — I wake up feeling very tired, and check all the updates again: news, friends, fire map. I also check my work; nothing new. Everything is okay, the Napa fire has grown a lot, but thankfully not in the direction of town. I try to go back to sleep but I can't for the next hour. At some point, I fall asleep. 10 a.m. — Omg, I wake up and it's 10. How did that happen?! I decide not to volunteer today and focus on resting and getting a bunch of work done. Before leaving, I snack on tomatoes that are about to go bad and baba ganoush. Petaluma was sent a warning notice this morning, which wasn't an evacuation zone, but which we took to mean, “Get a bag ready in case a fire starts somewhere near you.” 11 a.m. — It's smoky everywhere, but as I stop for gas in Novato, I can see that the sky to the east is distinctly orange. $41 11:30 a.m. — A quick stop at the 99 Ranch Market (big Asian market) because it's on the way. I decide to grab some yam greens, small head of Napa cabbage, sesame mochi balls, and a big bag of Calbee seaweed chips. I've never tried the last two, but they're on sale and I like snacks when I'm stressed. Also, grab a fresh-baked pork sung and green onion bun ($1.75) from the bakery next to the store. I haven't had pork sung (I call it pork floss) in years and so I'm curious if I still like it. I do. It's nicely salty and savory and just what I want for my drive home. $9.04 12 p.m. — I check on the status of everything once I get home. (I am constantly checking so I'll stop mentioning it.) There's not much I can do right now, so I start working. I'm luckily at a bit of a lull in my main work project and nothing crazy or time sensitive is happening this week. My workplace, based in Petaluma, sent out a notice that they'll be paying full wages for this week while the site is closed because of safety and air quality concerns, which I think is nice. Work feels really weird, like I shouldn't be doing normal activities while the world is literally on fire around me. Email is eerily quiet, and it feels like I'm sending out emails into the void since some of the people I work with are not working right now. Why am I working? Should I be volunteering right now? I feel conflicted. I eat a lot of chips and then sesame mochi balls. I also submit 16 hours of sick time for this week, since I haven't been productive this week. 3 p.m. — I start texting my friends who are in the fire-affected cities to see if they want to come over for dinner this weekend. I've got a few takers, so I'm excited to see them and give them hugs. 6:30 p.m. — I am very tempted to make ramen for dinner. The things is, I love ramen, but my body doesn't. I do want greens, so I stick with the plan and make a soup with the yam greens and Napa cabbage. Something about the hot savory broth and silky green leaves is comforting and fills me up with goodness. I make a huge pot, and eat a huge bowl. 9 p.m. — Damn, I have missed the past two days of my pill; this is unfortunate. I must also report that I finished the bag of chips. Daily Total: $50.04",2,216
"7 a.m. — I'm out and at the gym for climbing with my friend. My friend is very stressed about work, but venting and hard climbs make us both feel great. I also find out some good news about the fires, which have gone from being around 3% contained to 18%-24% contained. It's a relief to hear that there is progress. 9:30 a.m. — When I get home, I start work and eat breakfast: soup and an open-faced sandwich with black bean patty and vegan cheese melted all over it. 12:40 p.m. — I snack on a piece of toast with vegan butter. I'm planning to volunteer for the overnight shift tonight, but haven't decided on Napa or Petaluma. My boyfriend says he's down to help, so Petaluma it is. I read an article about a man and his wife surviving the fire in a pool, only to have his wife die in his arms. I burst into tears; the perks of working remotely. 2:15 p.m. — Lunchtime is the same leftovers. I don't mind. 5 p.m. — I'm done with work but I forgot about the rush hour traffic and need to wait it out a bit before I leave. I bring my sleeping bag just in case. $5 bridge toll on my FasTrak account. $5 7:10 p.m. — When I get to the shelter, most of the volunteer work is with donations. There are so many, it almost seems like many. We make gigantic piles of diapers sorted by size; there's also work unloading donations from cars; and always work sorting and organizing donations. A supervisor tells me that since the Coast Guard is here, it's better for them to do the overnight shifts instead of volunteers. As it becomes dark, it's heartening to see so many folks hustling late. Some parents have brought their elementary school children, who are kicking butt. 9:15 p.m. — By this time, most of the work is done; I head to my boyfriend's place to crash. Daily Total: $5",3,216
"9:15 a.m. — We sleep in because we're a little too tired to do the breakfast shift, 6 a.m. to 10 a.m. 10:15 a.m. — So many more people volunteer when it's daytime! There is tons to do. It's mostly physical, moving stuff everywhere, but much better than staying in one spot folding clothes. 12:30 p.m. — We grab free food at the shelter that will go bad if people don't eat it: bagels, hard-boiled eggs, fruit, salad, and mashed potatoes. 3:30 p.m. — On the way back to Oakland, I grab groceries for the dinner tonight: two cans chickpeas, yogurt, parsley, cilantro, plums, lemon, limes, corn meal, onions, and wine. It's later than I anticipated when we start cooking; my roommate is also cooking for a party tonight so it's a lively scene. I take a shot of whisky because cooking while buzzed is really fun. The air seems good right now so we open the windows for fresh air. It's the first time we've opened the windows since the fire started. $24.93 6:15 p.m. — Some friends come over, and we have a good time chatting and eating dinner. I was expecting more people to show up but it works out well with a few people. We somehow manage to finish most of the food I made (probably because we all continue to munch at the dinner table as the night goes on). Dinner tonight is roasted spiced cauliflower, falafel with an herby yogurt sauce, and polenta. 9:45 p.m. — Our friends head home and there are hugs all around. We clean up and relax until it's time for bed. Daily Total: $24.93",4,216
"9:15 a.m. — Sleeping in is so nice. I'm not sure why I'm sleeping so much these days. 11:30 a.m. — We're going for a hike in the Redwoods. One of the major perks of living in Oakland is that you're generally only a 10-minute drive away from hiking trails and serious forests. It smells like eucalyptus and redwoods so we hike without respirators. 1 p.m. — Back at the house, I start working on Project Tater Tot and eat a snack of yogurt with lemon curd. 2 p.m. — Time for a plum and reheated polenta. I add more bouillon, salt, and a bit of miso, then pour it into a cake pan so I can chill it for later. 3:30 p.m. — I find a group and conference for women in clean tech and sustainability — the membership costs about $150, and the conference is roughly $100. I don't go to any events, but I feel like I should start looking into professional and grassroots communities. I pass on buying anything for now. 4 p.m. — We take a stroll and grab slices of pizza at Arizmendi (fennel, bell peppers, feta, other deliciousness on top), and then decide to also try a slice at Lanesplitter (pesto, olives, tomatoes) before going to see . Boyfriend buys the tickets ($12) since I bought the pizza. $11 7:45 p.m. — was amazing! It's one of those movies that puts me in a contemplative and mischievous zone after. We walk around a bit in the area before we walk home. I read a little bit of a new book ( ) and then pack up to go back to my boyfriend's place. I always feel like I carry too many bags for a simple overnight trip. I always bring work stuff, project work stuff, a change of clothes, and homemade food so I won't have to buy anything. Bridge toll again. $5 10:30 p.m. — We're both energized but can't stay out too late because there's work tomorrow, so we decide to go inhale junk food. He gets animal fries from In-N-Out and I get curly fries from Jack in the Box. I honestly don't like the In-N-Out fries very much and I haven't had curly fries in years. Sooo good. $3.23 Daily Total: $19.23",5,216
"9:30 a.m. — Head into the office, which feels very normal even though we've been out for a week. The water cooler talk, as expected, is all about the fire and how we've been affected. On the way to work, I take a longer look at my hair, which I thought was in good shape; in reality, it is dying at the ends. I'm seriously overdue for a haircut so I make an appointment when I get to work. It's been a year and a half, and I cringe about having to explain the state of my hair to my hairdresser later. 10:30 a.m. — I eat the yogurt and granola that I brought from home and a plum an hour later. There's also nut mix around the office. Mmm, cashews. 1:45 p.m. — For lunch, there's a bunch of leftover cheese pizza in the work fridge which I know will get thrown out if people don't partake. Free food! (Even though I do feel a bit of pizza overload coming on.) I get into a good groove after lunch and it's a productive day. I chat with a friend at the company about a new role I would possibly take on in a few months. I'm always conflicted between wanting to pursue my Tater Tot Project and my professional career at this company. For now, I feel lucky that I'm able to do both, but I know that if I don't push for career opportunities at my company, I won't get them (when you tell people you want to work part-time, they know you're half out the door). 5:15 p.m. — Head over to chop off some dead hair! It's $30 and I give $9 tip (exactly how much cash I have left). She's really nice and says my hair damage isn't too bad (phew), and proceeds to give me the quickest haircut I've ever had. I get in and out in under 20 minutes. $39 6:15 p.m. — Oh no, my hair is flaring out because it's about shoulder length, which I hate. When she asked if I want layers, I said, “Uh, sure. Why not?” Wrong choice. Why did I do this to myself? I visit my boyfriend before I head home. He does not understand why I'm grumpy about my hair or why I spend five minutes staring in the mirror. 7:20 p.m. — He offers me chicken curry to go with my polenta, which I happily eat for dinner. We listen to an interesting NPR episode about the importance of sleep. By this point, I'm done being upset about my hair. There's nothing I can do about it since my goal other than grow it out. 8:40 p.m. — My boyfriend convinces me to stay a bit longer instead of leaving, so I start working on Project Tater Tot while he reads and makes weird noises on the foam roller. I get in a good two hours of work, hang out a bit, then make the drive home. I am SO happy to be in my own bed, and look forward to staying put for a few days, having some alone time, and getting some work done. Daily Total: $39",6,216
"8:45 a.m. — I cannot make myself go to the gym in the morning unless I'm meeting someone. So I sleep in until my first meeting starts. I like my job, there's a lot of odds and ends I take care of today, before I do more technical work. It can be hard for people with a bachelor's degree in science to get more interesting jobs, and I think project management is something to keep in mind if it sounds interesting to you. 10:20 a.m. — I make crispy seasoned bean curd, a fried egg, yam greens and Hong Kong noodles with oyster sauce and sesame oil for breakfast. I drink the rest of my soup too. I eat a plum an hour later. 1:45 p.m. — For lunch, I add different seasonings to my polenta to change it up and eat a polenta bowl with garlic, parmesan, and a boatload of fresh parsley. My fridge is out of vegetables, so I'll have to make a trip later today. My friend left me a small green tea ice cream encased in chocolate waffle. I try it and it's really good. I've never had the chocolate and green tea combination before, I tentatively like it. 3 p.m. — Snack on yogurt with lemon curd. 5 p.m. — I do a 20-minute cardio kickboxing workout at home after work is done. I feel disproportionately proud of myself. 6:30 p.m. — I decide to walk to the closest grocery store because I only need veggies. It's nice to get out of the house and keeps me sane. As it turns out, this store is really expensive; I hone in on the sale stuff and grab three zucchinis, two carrots, and a pint of Straus cookies and cream ice cream, which is my current obsession. For dinner, I make pan-fried tofu slices with a Vietnamese marinade, a bunch of veggies (onions, carrot, zucchini), and use some leftover polenta. I share dinner with my roommate, and he shares the cherry kompot (Russian fruit drink) he made. It's really refreshing. I'm happy I've got enough leftovers for the next three meals. $7.84 9 p.m. — I read a few chapters of my new book and mess around on the internet for a while. I do a little bit of research on training classes that would be helpful for my project and might also be helpful for my job. I wonder if I can convince them to pay for it... 10 p.m. — Ice cream break. I wonder if someone who wanted some of the pint would be able to tell that I seek out the cookie bits. Daily Total: $7.84",7,216
"8:30 a.m. — I sleep in two hours more than usual. I typically wake up at 6:30 a.m. for an hour each of indoor cycling and running outside, but I recently injured myself and can't exercise for two weeks. I don't mind the extra sleep though! I take a quick shower, tidy up for work, and decide to walk the two miles to my office downtown. 11 a.m. — After my morning meetings are over, I realize I haven't eaten anything yet. Not exercising two hours before work certainly kills my appetite! I'm feeling a bit hungry and I probably won't eat lunch until 1:30 p.m., so I grab a bowl of cereal from the office kitchen. I love mixing cereal! Today's concoction includes a handful of Cinnamon Toast Crunch, Reese's Peanut Butter Puffs, Captain Crunch, and Rice Krispies with vanilla almond milk. 1:30 p.m. — I have 30 free minutes before my next meeting. I consider grabbing something quick from Whole Foods, but as I put on my jacket to leave the office, I notice there is a giant platter of leftover sandwiches in the kitchen. I grab two different kind of wraps — portobello mushroom with beets, and a goat cheese and chicken Caesar wrap — and devour them at my desk. Love free lunches! 3:15 p.m. — I've been in and out of meetings all day and need to get some fresh air. I step out of the office to walk around for a bit. I do some window shopping at Brookfield Place (one of the nicest, glitziest shopping mall in Manhattan!) and score super comfortable, grey yoga pants from Lululemon. It's 50% off regular price, so I make the purchase without even trying it on. $50 5:30 p.m. — Such a nice fall day outside, even though it's November. It's already pitch black though because daylight savings time just ended. I hate when it gets dark around 4 p.m.! I walk home again to get my steps in. I consider stopping by Sephora to buy a mascara, but decide to head home because I'm hungry. I stop by my neighborhood's CVS to get three bottles of Diet Pepsi, my guilty pleasure; they're on sale for $0.99 each. $3.29 7 p.m. — I am trying a new meal subscription service called RealEats. Each meal is vacuum-sealed into food-safe, recyclable plastic pouches that you place into boiling water and voila! Tonight's menu is braised lamb with polenta and spicy carrots. It's easy to prepare and tastes delicious. I eat half of the ice cream sandwich for dessert. $15 10 p.m. — One of my roommates announces today that she got a new job in San Francisco and will be moving there by the end of the month. While she is technically responsible for finding someone to take her lease, I also feel obligated to find someone I like. I post on several sites about the room opening, and pray that I will be ""matched"" with someone sane. My worst nightmare is hearing these horror stories about random Craigslist roommates. I talk to my mom for a bit before going to bed. Daily Total: $68.29",1,217
"8:10 a.m. — I couldn't fall asleep until 2 a.m. last night, probably because I had five cans of Diet Coke. (Again, it's my vice!) I begrudgingly wake up, take a shower, and take my 8:30 a.m. call in bed. The meeting runs over by 30 minutes, but luckily I have some down time so decide to walk to work again. It's supposed to rain later today, so I make sure to bring an umbrella. I listen to a podcast (I'm obsessed with , , and , among others) on the way. 1:30 p.m. — I haven't eaten anything since I woke up this morning, so I am starving. I see leftover sandwiches in the office kitchen (day two of free lunch continues!), so I grab two chicken salad sandwiches. There's a generous amount of tender chicken smothered in mayonnaise with walnuts and craisins. I'm feel hungry after devouring the sandwiches, so I take a handful of trail mix to snack on (and end up picking out the M&Ms to eat). 5 p.m. — I want to continue my streak of walking to work, but it is pouring outside. My shoes get soaked while walking to the nearest subway station. ($2.75) Rainy days are my least favorite. Before heading home, I stop by a jewelry shop near my apartment. My best friend from college, who is in town this week for work, celebrated her birthday last week; I am treating her to dinner tonight. I get her 14-karat gold-coated, sterling silver earrings ($54). $56.75 6 p.m. — Two girls come visit the apartment to see the room that is opening up. One is a second grade teacher from Tennessee, while the other works in finance. Both girls seem cordial and respectful. Given the prime location of my apartment (and it being rent-controlled), I don't worry about finding someone to fill the room. It feels like speed dating. 6:40 p.m. — My friend and I meet for dinner at a trendy Asian fusion restaurant in the Meatpacking District. Everything on the menu looks delicious, and our eyes become bigger than our stomachs. We order everything from dumplings and noodles, to sushi rolls and sashimi. We save room for dessert — mochi! I am scared to look at the damage we've done when the waitress brings our check. Well, you only live once! The bill doesn't look so bad when you split it. At least I didn't spend any money on lunch yesterday and today. I also bring back leftovers; ""free"" lunch tomorrow, I suppose. $140 11 p.m. — I am quite tired, both from eating all the food and from going to bed late last night. I read the latest magazine that came in the mail today (I get a free subscription through work) and hit the sack. Daily Total: $196.75",2,217
"8:30 a.m. — Yesterday, a downpour of rain came in, and today came winter — the temperature dropped 20 degrees to signal that it is officially winter. I put on a knee-length, gray wool coat and mittens to stay warm on my commute to work. I recently upgraded to an iPhone 7 Plus (no, I could not justify dropping $1,000 for the iPhone X), so I asked my brother if he wanted my old, yet totally functional phone (iPhone 6 SE Plus). I stop by USPS to ship it to him in California. It should be delivered in two days. $8.35 1:30 p.m. — Wednesdays are my busy days, and I'm in meetings all day. Luckily, my 1:30 p.m. meeting is a WebEx and I am just listening in, so I grab my leftover dinner from last night (spicy tuna rolls topped with torched salmon, and two dumplings) and eat it for lunch. I take two Halloween chocolates from the kitchen as well. 6 p.m. — I've been inside all day, so I can't wait to leave the office to get fresh air. I plug in my headphones, listen to music on Spotify (I'm on a free subscription; I actually don't mind the occasional commercial breaks), and completely zone out during my 40-minute walk home. I stop by a Thai restaurant and pick up chicken pad Thai for dinner. $16 6:30 p.m. — Another girl reaches out to express her interest in the apartment. Because she can only stay for the next six months, and I don't want to go through the hassle of finding another roommate, I kindly decline her request. 7 p.m. — My friend texts me literally at the last minute, asking if I want to see on Broadway because she got a pair of comped tickets. I've been wanting to see this play, so I immediately call Uber to get to the theater as soon as possible. I encounter some traffic, but manage to get to Times Square within 20 minutes. I am a bit late to the show, but can't complain; we have amazing orchestra seats in the sixth row. The play is beautiful, and I enjoy every minute of it. $20 10:15 p.m. — My friend and I walk around for a bit after the show. I am very hungry because I didn't have a chance to eat my chicken pad Thai, which is probably all dry by now. I guess I will save it for lunch tomorrow. I really want to eat the soft serve ice cream cone from McDonald's, but give up on satisfying my craving after visiting THREE different McDonald's with malfunctioning ice cream machines. Sigh. I come home instead and go to bed. Daily Total: $44.35",3,217
"8:30 a.m. — The buzzer from our cleaner wakes me up. She comes once a month to clean the common spaces (living room, kitchen, and bathroom). After I finish getting ready for work, I leave $120 (includes tip) for the cleaner. I Venmo $40 each to my roommates to split the cost. $40 1 p.m. — For lunch, I eat the pad Thai I bought last night. I am taking the day off from work tomorrow because my dad is visiting me from Atlanta. I try to multitask in order to leave work a little early, but end up making a mess by spilling water all over my laptop. Ugh, the weekend can't come soon enough. 3:35 p.m. — Done with work! I rush back to my apartment, pack my belongings, and head to a hotel in Midtown where I am staying with my dad for the next two nights. I wanted to treat him to a comfortable visit to NYC, so I booked a king suite. The friendly receptionist offers me one of the most coveted rooms, which features an original photograph of Yoko Ono and John Lennon. The suite feels like a home away from home in the middle of the city, with a cozy reading nook by the window overlooking the Manhattan skyline and two full bathrooms. $700 7:10 p.m. — I take NJ Transit to the airport to pick up my dad. On the way to the station, I stop by Pret for iced coffee, but the cashier doesn't charge me because ""he likes my scarf."" I meet my dad at the airport and we take Lyft Line back to the city. $29 for a trip back to Manhattan is such a good deal, even though we take a 20-minute detour to drop off the other passenger in Jersey City. $43 9:30 p.m. — Shake Shack is listed as one of the items on my dad's to-do list. We go to the original location in Madison Square Park and order bacon cheeseburger and loaded fries. Shake Shack is a bit too heavy and greasy for my liking, and I personally prefer In-N-Out. We walk back to the hotel to help with digestion before calling it a night. $21 Daily Total: $804",4,217
"10:45 a.m. — I am excited to sleep in and take the day off from work to hang out with my dad! I found out yesterday that the hotel guests can book a HIIT class at a CrossFit gym next door at a discounted price. My leg is feeling a lot better and I haven't done much exercise at all this week, so I decide to check it out. Upon arriving, I am immediately intimidated by the extremely fit men and women gathered at the gym — and they all seem to know each other. We go through a round of exercises. I am absolutely exhausted about 40 minutes into the class and decide to do the ""walk of shame"" and sneak out. No regrets! $20 12:30 p.m. — My dad and I check out a new Shanghainese restaurant near the hotel for lunch. They have good lunch special deals, but I really want to try some items from the regular menu, including a giant soup dumpling that you eat with a straw. We end up ordering a bit too much for two people and feel very stuffed afterward, so we decide to walk around in Central Park. $65 2:45 p.m. — We visit the American Museum of Natural History. (I got a complimentary one-year membership through IDNYC.) I could spend the entire day here without getting bored; the museum is huge and there is so much to see. My favorite exhibit is the ""Scales of the Universe,"" which illustrates the vast range of sizes in the universe. Every time I come here, it makes me realize how minuscule the earth is in the grand scheme of the Milky Way and the Universe. 6 p.m. — We visit an American restaurant that specializes in local products, line-caught fish, and seasonal produce. The waitress recommends ordering a bunch of small dishes and appetizers to share. My favorite is the pumpkin flatbread topped with cubes of butternut squash, goat cheese crumble, baby spinach, pumpkin seeds, and a drizzle of honey. It has a fantastic balance of sweet and savory. Dinner takes longer than expected, so we skip dessert and catch an Uber downtown for a show. $115 8 p.m. — We have a fourth row seat at STOMP. From mops and brooms to shopping carts and plastic bags, STOMP performers use everything they see in sight to create rhythm and sound. The show is a bit too loud, and because the performers literally stomp on the stage to make sound, it gets really, really dusty. $200 10 p.m. — It's a nice evening out, so my dad and I walk back to the hotel. On the way, we stop by Whole Foods so I can buy vitamins. My dad tells me he is loving NYC so far, and I am really happy to hear that. $10 Daily Total: $410",5,217
"10:35 a.m. — I am still feeling full from last night's dinner. It's a beautiful fall day, so I decide to go for a jog outside. I run for about an hour and stop by a café to get a large iced green tea. I don't drink coffee, but I love tea. I come back to the hotel and take a quick shower. $3.29 12:30 p.m. — This is the last meal with my dad before he leaves NYC. We go to one of the oldest steakhouses near Wall Street, where we indulge in Kobe beef filet mignon and whole steamed lobster. I don't normally eat like this; this is a rare occasion where I get to treat myself! After our heavy lunch, we take a walk across the Brooklyn Bridge and take pictures with a selfie stick I bought on Amazon a couple of days ago ($10). $230 3:15 p.m. — I have a final activity planned with my dad before he heads to the airport. We visit a sleek, upscale movie theater where visitors can enjoy plush seating, gourmet bites, and cocktails while watching the latest films. Because we are still so full from lunch, we decline even the complimentary popcorn that comes with the movie ticket purchase. The full reclining seats, which are reminiscent of first-class airline cabins, are so comfortable that I hear my dad snoring during the movie. Embarrassing! $45 6 p.m. — I scheduled a shuttle bus to pick up my dad and take him to the airport. I don't get to see him very often, so I really try to squeeze in as much as possible when he visits. $20 7:15 p.m. — As comfortable as the hotel was, there is truly no place like home! I am excited to be back in my apartment and spend the rest of the evening lounging around and watching YouTube clips. I walk over to Whole Foods Market to pick up something to eat for dinner. I love their salad bar selection. I put a little bit of everything (grilled chicken, sweet potato, and quinoa) in the little paper container. $15 Daily Total: $313.29",6,217
"10:15 a.m. — It feels like it should be Monday because I took Friday off, but it's still the weekend! I have a pile of dirty laundry sitting in my room, so I cross the street to the nearest laundromat. I don't have a washer and dryer in the building, but because I live on the first floor and the laundromat is across the street. It has never really bothered me much, except when it's raining. I typically have to allocate at least two and a half hours to do laundry. $4.50 12:30 p.m. — After dining out so much over the past few days, I feel the need to go on a mini-cleanse. I walk over to a juice bar near apartment and pick out the healthiest sounding cold-pressed juice, which includes kale, spinach, parsley, celery, and cucumber. It doesn't sound too appetizing, but I am hopeful my body will thank me afterward. $9.50 2:15 p.m. — I have a little bit of work to do, mostly checking and responding to emails and prepping for meetings coming up this week. After two productive hours of work, I want to treat myself — so I decide to get a manicure. I pick a pink, glitter manicure to don my nails. The technician applies lotion on my dry hands and also gives me a mini-massage. $14 5:30 p.m. — My roommate told me about an amazing sale at Madewell, so I walk over to check it out. I can't believe my luck when I find a pair of summer shorts for just $5! Best of all, they are in my size. I buy four shorts and a button-up shirt, also on sale for just $10. Even though I probably won't be able to wear these until next summer, I am still so excited for the amazing bargain. $30 7 p.m. — I dig through the fridge for something to eat for dinner so I don't have to go outside. There's not much, but I pick out cottage cheese, microwavable mini-corn dogs, and a bowl of cereal (Special K with strawberries) with almond milk. 10:15 p.m. — I usually go to New Jersey once or twice a week for work; it's about two-hour commute from Manhattan. I hit the lights early so I can get good sleep to start off the work week. Daily Total: $58",7,217
"7 a.m. — Wake up to get PJ (the boy I nanny) to school. I'm out the door by 7:15. I have a lot of errands to run today so I mentally prepare for what's ahead. After I drop PJ off, I head to get my oil changed. I've been putting it off for a while, but finally decide to get it done since I'm taking a mini-road trip next week. It's $7 off since I get there before 10. $54.89 9 a.m. — I rush home to register for my last semester of undergrad and get all the classes I want. Yay! Afterwards, I head out to go grocery shopping but first make a stop at Chick-fil-A ($2.79) and fill up my gas tank ($41.82). $44.61 9:45 a.m. — I haven't been to Trader Joe's since I lived in New York for my internship, but I'm reminded of how much I love it again today. Something about TJ makes a girl happy. I get everything I need for meal prep this week: spring mix, tomatoes, cucumbers, onions, apples, grapes, chicken sausage, pasta, marinara sauce, thyme, pot stickers, and a bottle of pinot grigio for a treat ($41.72). I also run to Kroger for sliced turkey, ground turkey, chicken breasts, and a bottle of balsamic vinaigrette. I start to stress out because I'm running late for my therapy appointment in Buckhead and it's pouring, meaning traffic will be annoying ($17.54). $59.26 11:15 a.m. — I get to therapy 15 minutes late because I had to drop off my groceries at home, but my therapist is understanding. I've missed the past two weeks because I've been so busy, and today was much-needed, and refreshing. Unfortunately, I have to pay for the past couple of sessions but I put it on my credit card ($120). I also pay for parking on the way out ($3). $123 12:45 p.m. — I finally get home and can start meal prepping. I put on an episode of (new fave!) and begin. 3 p.m. — I change into my gym clothes and head over to my personal trainer. After my workout, it's time to pick up PJ. I take him home to get him ready for swim lessons. His mom is out of town and I'm taking on more roles this week with him. 8 p.m. — PJ's mom texts me to grab pumpkins for him to decorate at school. She'll add the costs to my check at the end of the week. ($3 expensed) I finally get home for the night and finish cooking. I don't finish until 10:30, and am already on my third glass of wine. Oops. I FaceTime my BFF and we talk about our upcoming trip to the mountains. I fall asleep around midnight, dreading my 6 a.m. workout. Daily Total: $281.76",1,218
"6:55 a.m. — I wake up angry at myself for oversleeping and am unusually tired, probably because of all the wine. After I get back home from picking up PJ and taking him to school, I decide to skip my 9:30 a.m. class and take a nap until 10. 12:30 p.m. — LOL. I overslept again and won't be going to the gym today. I get in the shower and get dressed for class, packing clothes for my sorority's initiation ceremony tonight. I eat one of the salads I prepped and decide to steal salad dressing from work, since I'm not a fan of this one. I leave the house around 1:45 to make sure I get to class on time. 3:45 p.m. — My advertising class was uneventful as usual, and I decide to skip my 4:30 class to do homework in the library. Its two and a half hours long and I can't stand to listen to my boring professor today, plus a friend tells me that she will sign my name so that I can get points for attendance. During my study break, I buy on Amazon Prime. $11.20 7 p.m. — Tonight is my sorority's initiation ceremony. Even though I went alum in May, I go to celebrate my great-grand little's initiation. After the ceremony is over, we decide to celebrate with a “family dinner.” I hate that I'm going to spend money after going grocery shopping, but we've had this planned for weeks. The Cuban restaurant we wanted to go to is closed so we go to Chili's. The food is bad and the service is even worse; never again. $18.22 10:30 p.m. — I leave the restaurant and stop by PJ's house to check on him and his sister. Their mom is out of town and she wants to make sure everything is okay in the house. After, I go back home and start to prepare for tomorrow. I get in bed and toss around because I napped so much today, but finally doze off around 2 a.m. Daily Total: $29.42",2,218
"7 a.m. — Up to pick up PJ. It takes me longer than usual and now it's time to get ready for my serving shift at work (a.k.a. the pizza prison) at 10 a.m. I eat a breakfast of sliced turkey and grapes. 2 p.m. — I am cut from work and decide to order a salad so that I won't be too full by the time I work out. It was a pretty good morning shift, and I get half off anyways. $3.10 4 p.m. — I head to the gym for a cardio session and my trainer scolds me for skipping yesterday. When I'm finished, I rush to get PJ from school, and his mom texts me to get dinner for him and his sister. I stop at Wendy's and Zaxby's on the way back; she'll pay me back with my paycheck. ($13.45, expensed) 6:15 p.m. — I stop at the gas station to vacuum my car ($2) and get a car air freshener ($2). $4.00 6:45 p.m. — Home and it's time for dinner: chicken with onions and peppers, broccoli, and roasted potatoes.

"12:30 p.m. — Once again, I wake up late and miss my 9:30 class, but I'll make up for it by going to one of my professor's other sections so it doesn't affect my grade. I pack lunch, dinner, and snacks for the day since my last class doesn't let out until 9:45 p.m., and am out the door by 1:40. 3:45 p.m. — Finished with my 2:30 class where I just learned that we have an exam on Tuesday. Ugh. I head to the café to heat up my pasta for lunch and start on homework. 7 p.m. — Still doing the same homework, and still hungry even after the pasta and snacks. I heat up my dinner (same as last night) and then go to class. 8:50 p.m. — My professor lets us out early so I get to go home! When I settle in, I immediately go to finish the homework I started earlier. I don't finish until 1 a.m., but am very relieved after I do so. I organize my agenda and prepare for the gym tomorrow. I am glad PJ's mom doesn't need me tomorrow morning so I can sleep in an extra hour before going to the gym. I doze off around 2 a.m. Daily Total: $0",4,218
"7:45 a.m. — Up and ready for my 8 a.m. gym session. I need to make it quick since I picked up a shift at work. When I am back from the gym, I grab an apple before changing into my work clothes. 2:30 p.m. — I am cut from work and head home. I eat lunch and start to watch a movie called on Netflix that my BFF recommended. 6 p.m. — My aunt calls to tell me she's leaving soon for the Georgia vs. Florida game. She asks if I want to dog sit or come with. I decide to tag along for the game since I don't have any plans this weekend. 7:45 p.m. — I stop at Chick-fil-A before hitting the road to Jacksonville. It's about a five-hour drive, and I plan on doing homework the entire way. $6.53 10 p.m. — We stop at a gas station. I grab Kettle chips and water. $4.23 1:30 a.m. — We finally get to the hotel and I pass out. Daily Total: $10.76",5,218
"9:30 a.m. — I am woken up by my aunt rushing us to get ready for the tailgate. I get ready and then we run to the mall to buy sneakers for my little cousin, who only brought slippers. I stop by Dunkin' in front of the hotel. $3.22 1:30 p.m. — We get to the stadium and I am shocked by the number of people there! I've never been into football, but it's nice to see so many people bonding over the sport. We get to our tent and I immediately make myself a drink and grab a plate. My trainer would not be happy with my eating habits today. 7:30 p.m. — Georgia won; go dawgs! We pack up our tent and go to a house by the beach where one of my aunt's friends lives. We continue to eat and drink, and then all the “adults” decide to hit the bars. I'm invited but I decide to stay at the house and watch . 1 a.m. — We get back to the hotel and I fall asleep.

"5 a.m. — I am insanely jet-lagged and finally get out of bed at 5 a.m. after tossing and turning since 3:30. I returned home on Wednesday from a week in Europe, and I have had the hardest time getting over jet lag. I make myself my standard breakfast — oatmeal with almond milk and honey and a big cup of coffee. I then go out on a run for the first time in three weeks. I have been traveling a lot lately for medical school interviews as well as my recent Europe trip, and am feeling the pain. Five miles feel like 50. 8 a.m. — After my grueling run, I hop in the shower and quickly change before heading out the door to work. I only live about a mile away from the hospital, so I get to walk. It has been disturbingly sunny and warm in Boston the past couple of days, and I sweat through my sweater on the 20-minute stroll. I sit at my desk and open up my food services account through the hospital to reload it. For putting $100 on the card, I get a $20 bonus, plus using this card gets me a 20% discount on the food in the hospital food court! I head down to get a coffee and cereal cup for a second breakfast/post-workout boost. $100 3 p.m. — It is a slow Friday, and one of the doctors I work for is out, so after getting sweet potato fries twice from the hospital food court (I am a creature of habit and eat very specific foods), I call it a day about an hour early and head home. On my way back I stop at the Trader Joe's across the street from my apartment (I know, I am truly blessed) to pick up some of my staples: Fiber-O cereal, unsalted roasted almonds, pretzel slims, almond milk, strawberries, blueberries, blackberries, raspberries, watermelon slices, and the Green Salad Palette for dinner tonight. Usually my parents stock up groceries but to offset the burden of my living at home, I try to cover my own food costs as much as I can. That's not to say I do not indulge in my dad's cooking every once in a while! $35.91 8 p.m. — I was invited to interview at a medical school out of town, so I look up the transportation options I have to get there, but don't commit to anything. I am thinking of tacking on a vacation to this interview, but am debating whether I want to spend that much money. I just came back from vacation but have been saving up my days off for this autumn interview circuit, and want to indulge as much as I can! My exploration is interrupted by my dog jumping on my lap, knocking my computer aside. She has been extra needy ever since I came home, and so I spend the rest of the night giving her quality cuddle time and catching up on trashy reality TV that I missed while abroad.

"10 a.m. — I was up at 5 a.m. again. Jet lag always kicks my butt going from east to west! I make oatmeal and coffee and rewatch last night's reality TV, which I fell asleep watching. It is my mental junk food and I am not ashamed. I then head out to drop off my interview suit at the dry cleaner's ($25). It has seen better days, and after being lugged around four cities over five days it is in need of a good wash. I also stop by the next door Starbucks and get a grande skim milk cappuccino ($4.37). $29.37 12 p.m. — I eat a berry salad to tide me over until lunchtime. I then pack almonds and an apple my parents bought at the farmers' market, and take my dog out to the dog park. It rained overnight and it is so muddy, but my 65-pound mutt loves it. She finds the rattiest tennis ball and insists we play fetch. I can't help it, she is too cute. 2 p.m. — My dad has spent the past year perfecting his bread recipe and culturing his sourdough starter; props to him because his homemade breads have gotten much better recently. I make an open-faced tomato and cheese sandwich with Israeli cheese my mom picked up at the specialty import store in our neighborhood. I snack on pretzel slims as well. 4 p.m. — My mom drops a bombshell on me by telling me that a sibling I do not get along with is coming home the week I'm scheduled to go out of town for my interview, and is planning on staying the weekend. Given we are not even on speaking terms at the moment, this announcement reaffirms my desire to tack on more days to my interview trip. I bookmark a bunch of Airbnb rooms, but do not take the plunge as I reassess my month's budget. 8 p.m. — Annoyed and upset, I text my friend to see if she is up to grabbing a bite with me. She is, and we go to the neighborhood fro-yo spot for sweets and heart-to-heart convo. She and I have been friends since high school, lost touch during college, and reconnected when we both moved back to Boston. I love having friends who have known my family drama for years, and I love her even more for covering my sugar high. Daily Total: $29.37",2,219
"9 a.m. — I wake up at 5 a.m. again and laze out of going on a run. Instead, I make my standard oatmeal and coffee, and sign up for a marathon-training plan on the Nike Run Club app. I input the Paris Marathon date (April 8th, 2018) as my projected race date. It has been a bucket list item of mine for years, but I want to see if I stick to the plan before I officially sign up. In the meantime, I continue my pseudo-productivity by finally booking the Airbnb I have been eyeing for two nights. I have a student-host at the medical school the night before, and the time overlap between my sibling and me will be less than 24 hours. Disaster averted. $146.96 11 a.m. — My youngest sibling comes home happy from winning a race that morning. In celebration, I make omelets for everyone. I then take the mutt to the dog park; it is sunny today and there are lots of puppy pals to play with, but she once again finds the muddiest, grossest ball and insists on slobbering all over it playing fetch. I can't say no to her face. 1 p.m. — I munch on way too many almonds and do a more intensive assessment of my finances for the near future. I schedule my last federal loan payment of $1,100, as well as a credit card payment for later in the month. Now that my federal loans are all paid off and my private loan payments are down at $280 per month, I will have an extra $1,000 per month freed up. I plan on taking a bit of a sabbatical before medical school to travel through Southeast Asia and New Zealand, and will need to save up some funds. I have about $5,000 already; in NZ I can get a working holiday visa. If I can save about $2,500 more, that will give me enough to survive for six months. I review my last few credit card statements to find where I can shave off some spending. I realize I have been traveling way too much, and start reconsidering my earlier spend on the Airbnb. I am clearly indecisive. 4 p.m. — I discuss my apprehensions with my youngest sibling, who is so much more mature than I was at that age. My need to get out of the house during that weekend is reaffirmed and I feel a little better. 8 p.m. — Mama made rice and vegan chili for dinner tonight, and we settle in to watch . She and I have recently fallen in love with TLC, although her favorite show is . My mom claims our dog loves . No comment. Daily Total: $146.96",3,219
"5 a.m. — Waking up at this hour is socially acceptable during the week, right? Oatmeal and coffee first thing, then I head to the gym to run on the treadmill as per the NRC app training program. It is an easy 2.5 mile run, but it still hurts. I cannot believe how much fitness I have lost from a three-week break. 8 a.m. — I pack Fiber-O's from last week's purchase to snack on at work and head out. I pick up a coffee at the food court and sit down for a day of paperwork and phone calls. As a research assistant, I do a lot of the scheduling and recruiting of patients, which means speaking to a wide variety of people from all over Boston who represent a whole host of different communities. I love this job because of the direct patient interaction; I feel like a real doctor-to-be. 2 p.m. — My lab group meets for two hours and I am bored out of my mind the entire time. I am so relieved to finally be excused. I go to the food court to get sweet potato fries and a rice pilaf dish. 6 p.m. — I make it home from work around 4:30 p.m. and take the dog out for her afternoon walk. I look at Uber prices for a different interview I have within commuting distance of Boston the next day, and am shocked to see that it would cost me $75. I immediately look for alternatives and settle on a bus in the morning. I figure I can find my way home on the way back depending on when the day ends. $9.50 7 p.m. — I almost forget to pick up my suit from the dry cleaner and make it right before they close. Second disaster averted. Daily Total: $9.50",4,219
"5 a.m. — Finally a day I can justify an early wake-up! I eat my standard breakfast and get dressed in my interview suit. I slip on my heels, do my hair and makeup, and cringe. I hate the way I look dressed up. I pack almonds to snack on and hit the road. 8 a.m. — I make it on my bus and hit the road, eating loudly crunching almonds to the dismay of my weary co-travelers. Once I make it to the bus stop at my destination town, I get a medium coffee from Dunkin'. $2.25 9 a.m. — I take the public bus across town to the medical school campus, but get off five stops too soon. Now have to march uphill in heels for a half-mile. I arrive sweaty and disoriented, but everyone is nervous too, so I feel I am in good company. $1.75 3:30 p.m. — The interview could have gone better. I really am a bad advocate for myself and need to learn the humble-brag. I getting better with each interview, so that is some consolation. Another interviewee and I get to the train station via Uber (she pays) just in time to catch the commuter rail back to Boston. I buy the ticket onboard, and she and I discuss our fears and anxieties about the application process. It is a long process that starts in June and goes on until May of the following year; once you submit your application, the wait is indefinite. It is excruciating, especially for someone as impatient as me. $11.50 6 p.m. — My mom bought all my Trader Joe's favorites because she knew I would be stressed post-interview. Sometimes living at home sucks, but other times — it is the best. My pup comes to cuddle on the couch, and we watch together. Daily Total: $15.50",5,219
"6 a.m. — Wow, I must have been truly exhausted from my interview because I wake up a whole hour later than usual! I have my standard breakfast and head to the gym for a guided tempo run via the NRC app. I shower and settle in for a day working from home. 11 a.m. — I buy the transport tickets to my out-of-town interview next week and begin to plan my weekend excursion as well. I text a friend in that town and we make plans for tacos and tequila post-interview. Now I am excited. $27 12 p.m. — I eat more almonds and take my dog to the dog park, which is one of my favorite things to do in the world. Seriously guys, adopt a dog. It will change your life. 7 p.m. — After a zucchini linguine dinner, my mom and I watch old episodes of . Unexpectedly, the door swings open and my sibling walks in, and I freeze. My mom got the dates wrong and this is week they are home. I spend the rest of the night in my room, dodging awkward conversation. Daily Total: $27",6,219
"6 a.m. — I am so dreadfully boring with my same breakfast and morning run, this time a 2.5-miler that is much more difficult than I anticipated. I was never a runner before, and I am starting to remember why. 9 a.m. — As I walk to work I feel something a little funny occurring south of the border... After I get my morning coffee, I realize that Aunt Flo is knocking at the door. I am glad I have pads in my backpack that should tide me over for at least the morning. 12 p.m. — I use my lunch hour to step out and buy a wrap from Pret A Manger ($8.99) and some pads from the CVS ($8.99). I don't know what makes me angrier, the fact that the pads are so damn expensive, or the fact I just dropped the same amount on a wrap that is almost void of content. Never again. $17.98 4 p.m. — The first day of my period always drains my energy. I think I might be anemic but have never followed that hunch further than that. I make it home, finish off my almonds, and curl up in a ball. I inadvertently fall asleep way too early. 10:15 p.m. — I wake up covered in sweat and ravenous for chocolate. I open the freezer and find that my mama has bought my absolute favorite Dove strawberry sorbet chocolate bars; she must have picked up on my hormonal state. I eat two, get an immediate sugar high, and then crash back in bed around 11:30. Daily Total: $17.98",7,219
"6:10 a.m. — I wake up after hitting snooze several times. Realize that I do this too often. Get ready for the day. Make coffee, grab my breakfast and lunch that I packed last night, and out the door by 6:40. 6:50 a.m. — I take the L into work everyday. My account is set-up to auto-reload an unlimited pass. It's $100 a month, but it's still much cheaper than having a car. I listen to podcasts during the commute. Today, it's NPR's and . Normally, I get off a stop away from my office to get in a few extra minutes and steps outside, but the weather is turning. I hustle to my office and am at my desk by 7:30. 9:30 a.m. — I have a few conference calls and a board meeting this morning. I eat the breakfast I packed (scrambled eggs and potatoes doused in Cholula) and crank through a few emails. 12:30 p.m. — Have to run to another meeting. I eat a Larabar (Cashew Cookie!) on the way. I bought a box in bulk a few weeks ago. 2 p.m. — Lunch from home at my desk. Spaghetti squash with turkey meatballs and tomato sauce. 4:30 p.m. — The afternoon drags, but it's finally quittin' time. I meet up with my boyfriend to commute home together. He tells me about his first day in a new role. I'm very happy for him, but it also reminds me of how deeply unfulfilled I feel at my current job. It also started pouring so that doesn't help my mood. 7 p.m. — We go to trivia night at our favorite local bar, which has a burger special. I get a plain cheeseburger with no bun. I try to stay as gluten-free as possible because I have an autoimmune disease, and the symptoms improve when I don't gorge on bread and gluten. I do eat the seasoned fries though because they're delicious. We pay for our own meals. $9.13 10:45 p.m. — Our team did pretty awful today, but I always have fun with my friends. I bolt to catch the bus instead of waiting in the pouring rain. Get home and do my usual nighttime routine of cleansing my face and moisturizing. I prep my breakfast and lunch for tomorrow, make Sleepytime tea, and eat a frozen Reese's while watching a bit of . Each night, I wind down using an acupressure mat (also known as bed of nails...). It helps out with my migraines, joint pain, back pain, and has helped improve my sleep. HIGHLY RECOMMEND! Daily Total: $9.13",1,220
"6:10 a.m. — Wake up. Get ready. Make coffee. I don't wear much makeup, and typically do my hair at night, so I can spend my morning making pour over coffee. I love it! It's still raining so I race out the door and book it to the train. 8 a.m. — Breakfast is a banana, chia seeds, salted coconut chips and almonds while catching up on the news. I have another slow day of work ahead. I'm a media relations and public affairs manager for a relatively small agency, so some days are slower than slow. I'm always looking for other opportunities and trying to figure out my next move. 10:15 a.m. — I take my morning break by going on a brief walk and meditating. I recently started using the app Headspace, a free app that guides you through three- to 10-minute meditation sessions. Though I'm still new to it, I can already feel a difference with my anxiety and depression. 12:30 p.m. — Lunch is another serving of spaghetti squash and turkey meatballs. A huge part of my job is reading and analyzing state, local and federal government news so I spend my lunch break watching the Cook County Commissioner's meeting. They end up repealing the controversial soda tax after major public backlash. Always love seeing democracy at work, no matter the cause! 1:45 p.m. — I eat a Pink Lady apple I brought from home. 4:30 p.m. — Hustle home. I want to get a run in before the rain returns. I ordered compression socks from Amazon a few days ago, and I'm excited to give them a try! Unfortunately, as soon as I walk outside, it starts raining so I opt to use my mini-stepper and get a yoga session in. I love Yoga with Adrienne on YouTube! 10:15 p.m. — I do my normal nighttime routine which includes washing my face, drinking Sleepytime tea, eating a frozen Reese's, watching , and using my acupressure mat.

I promise to call her later in the day. 12:30 p.m. — Lunch at my desk. Another serving of spaghetti squash with turkey meatballs. 2 p.m. — I forgot my usual Larabar today. I take my afternoon break to walk to the nearest Walgreens. I buy a bag of pretzels and pay with change from my purse. $1.73 5:30 p.m. — I head out for a tempo run. I'm training for a half-marathon in January. Right now, my goal is to just finish, but I secretly want to finish in under two and a half hours. Today's run was honestly one of my best ever. I finish five miles in under an hour and feel great. 7 p.m. — I reward myself with the new episode of (yes...I still watch it...) and two frozen Reese's after a dinner of pork chops and green beans. I head to bed around 10:15 after my nightly routine and checking in on the Cubs v. Nationals game.

I transfer $320 to my card, but I've already accounted for that in my budget. I'm trying not to use my card as much anymore, but I also really like the points so we'll see. I also transferred one-third of my rent ($325) to an account that I use just for bills so I won't accidentally spend it. 12 p.m. — It's been a boring and slow week at work. The weather is amazing today, and the lunch I brought from home doesn't sound great after eating it for five days in a row. Plus, today is apparently Treat Yo Self Day according to Twitter. I head to Jason's Deli and buy a chicken sandwich and a cup of broccoli cheese soup. It's a ton of food and I save the soup for dinner. $8.57 3 p.m. — My office does flex scheduling; I alternate having a Friday off or getting off early. Today, I get to leave early which is especially great because the weather is amazing. 5 p.m. — I get in a quick-stepper workout and eat dinner (pork chop and half of the soup from lunch) before heading to a friend's house to watch first game of the ALCS.

Then, I head out to my favorite coffee shop for breakfast, mocha and a bagel. Unfortunately, the bagel I get is stale. Bummer. $7.50 3 p.m. — I spent the day editing and rewriting a paper for my dad. He's in a police academy leadership class this year and I've been helping edit his papers. Makes me miss school a little bit. I haven't really eaten anything aside from too many Reese's. 6 p.m. — It's still pouring, so I cancel dinner plans with my boyfriend and make dinner at home: another pork chop and the rest of my soup from yesterday. 9 p.m. — The rain finally lets up, and I'm bored from being cooped up inside. I convince my boyfriend to meet me for drinks at the arcade bar up the street. I get a blackberry cider for $6, but my boyfriend needs to meet the card minimum so he pays. 11:30 p.m. — Boyfriend is starving so we go to the late night Mexican food place next door. I'm not that hungry so I just pick at the chips, salsa and queso. He pays. 1 a.m. — Home. Fall asleep to YouTube videos. Daily Total: $7.50",5,220

The race atmosphere encourages us to go faster! 11 a.m. — We go to my favorite diner up the street for breakfast. I get a stack of chocolate chip pancakes and coffee; boyfriend gets a Spanish omelette. I withdrew $20 from the ATM to pay, but he whips his wallet out quicker and pays. 12:30 p.m. — REI is having a major clearance sale so we head downtown to check it out. I find a pair of Balega socks for $5. They're normally too expensive, but good socks and shoes are so important for running, so I find that they're worth it. Boyfriend is part of the co-op and needs one more pair for a discount so I give him five dollars, and he charges it to his card. $5 2 p.m. — We head to the running store down the street. I want to get my gait analysis updated to see if I should get different shoes before our half-marathon. The shoe recs are super similar to what I already have, and I think I can find a better deal on older models of shoes online so I pass on making any purchases. On the other hand, my boyfriend buys the ugliest pair of slides I've ever seen because he swears they're comfortable. Like Crocs on steroids! 6 p.m. — We window shop for the rest of the day, but I get hangry so we hop a bus to get ramen. Furious Spoon is a great local chain and is definitely worth the adverse affects from gluten. Today has just the right amount of chill in the air for it too. Everyone else must have thought so because it's packed. I get the Shoyu, and he gets the veggie. I pay. $28.15 7 p.m. — We head to a friend's house in Roscoe Village to watch the Cubs v. Dodgers. Boyfriend stops off to get beer. 10 p.m. — Well, Cubs lose on a walk-off, three-run homer. Feeling down, we decide to Uber instead of spending time on public transportation; boyfriend pays.

I didn't go grocery shopping this week, so I stop off at Walgreens and get a packet of oatmeal and plastic utensils for my desk. $4.54 12:30 p.m. — Morning passed relatively slowly. My only conference call for the day wrapped up quickly for a change, and the news has been quiet too. I left my lunch from Friday in the fridge, so I heat that up and dream it's pizza instead. 4:30 p.m. — Quiet afternoon so I leave right at 4:30. I contemplate going to Ulta because I have a 20% off coupon and want to try Mario Badescu's drying lotion. With the weather changing, my skin is breaking out and none of my usual products are working. But I remember that I need to go grocery shopping, so I begrudgingly head to Mariano's and fight off the Monday evening crowds. This week, I have to pick up an unusual amount of staples that I ran out of last week so my bill is higher than usual. I get gluten-free oats, sourdough bread, olive oil, ground turkey, light brown sugar, cashew milk, maple syrup, bananas, cheddar cheese, cauliflower and aluminum foil. I use the rest of the cash I had in my wallet ($15) and put the rest on my card. $43.12 6 p.m. — Get home and make dinner: leftover chicken tenders and rice while watching this weekend's .

I pack my bag with workout clothes so I can hopefully make it to a yoga class after work. 8:30 a.m. — Need to reload my MetroCard! I just started a new job and am waiting to deduct my transportation expenses from my paycheck, pretax. I usually get an unlimited card, but I'll be out of town the next few weekends, so it doesn't really make sense to get one right now. $26.25 9:30 a.m. — Breakfast at my desk. I try to keep breakfast foods at my desk at all times so I don't have an excuse to spend money. I eat a sprouted whole-wheat tortilla with almond butter and chia seeds, plus an apple. I also have my office's gross (but free) coffee. 12 p.m. — Lunch that I made this morning! Kale with garlic lemon dressing, brown rice, and cannellini beans with my favorite Healthade Kombucha flavor — blood orange, carrot, ginger. And a piece of dark chocolate for dessert. 4 p.m. — Snack time: green tea and Lesser Evil Buddha Bowl popcorn from the stash I keep at my desk. 5:30 p.m. — It looks like I'm going to make it to yoga! I dash out of the office with a coworker-friend to make sure we get a good spot for the 6 p.m. class. 7:30 p.m. — Just getting home from yoga. I have leftovers from meal prepping this morning, but I want to make sure I have lunch for tomorrow, so I sauté sweet potato cubes and fresh cremini mushrooms, and eat that with leftover brown rice and cannellini beans, topped with tahini and hot sauce! Delish. 9:30 p.m. — It takes me FOREVER to do the dishes. (We don't have a dishwasher.) I left dishes in the sink this morning and added more from dinner just now, and I have to stop and dry three times before I finish. My boyfriend is house/dog-sitting this whole week so I have our studio to myself, which is nice. (I love living with him, but I also really appreciate and need alone time.) But doing chores is kind of a drag since I'm so used to splitting everything with him. After I finish, I munch on strawberries and hunker down for the season finale of ! I put off watching it until all the episodes were released. I'm so sad it's over! 10 p.m. — Laundry pick up! I know I should probably go to the laundromat to do my laundry, but with all of my workout clothes, I need to do laundry once a week. Having someone wash and fold them, and being able to hang-dry my stuff for about $20/week is MORE than worth it for me. 11 p.m. — I go to bed hoping I don't have nightmares from .

"6:30 a.m. — Alarm goes off! I try to snooze 10 minutes, but get up because I'm having a bad dream anyway. It wasn't related to , but another one where I am at the airport trying to make my flight but I keep running into problems and can't make it to the gate! I get dressed and head to the gym. 7:30 a.m. — Gym time. The StairMaster machine I like is taken, so I walk on the treadmill until it frees up. I do the fat burner setting on hard for 30 minutes, then do a speed workout on the treadmill for 15, and then 15 minutes of an arm workout. I love starting the day with a tough workout. I head to the locker room to shower and, damn it, I forgot to pack a bra. My sports bra is too sweaty to even contemplate wearing it for the day, but luckily the dress I'm wearing is pretty thick and I think I can get away with it. (I just have Bs anyway.) 9:30 a.m. — Post-workout breakfast is a tortilla with almond butter, apple, and chia seeds again. I also have iced coffee that I brought from home. 1 p.m. — Lunch is last night's sweet potato, brown rice, and leftover kale salad. It has SO MUCH garlic in it people can probably smell me from a mile away, but I don't care because I love it. 5 p.m. — Green tea and popcorn from my stash. I became a snacker at my old job because I worked until 7 p.m. or later, so I needed a lil' something around 5 p.m. to get me through to dinner. 7 p.m. — I stop at the store to pick up things for dinner (more mushrooms and kale), and ingredients to make snacks. $11.55 9 p.m. — Laundry gets dropped off. I set up everything I'll need for the gym and the workday in my backpack. If I don't prepare absolutely everything I need the night before (down to the socks), I won't get up. $19.53 Daily Total: $31.08",2,221
"6:30 a.m. — Wake up for gym time! I get myself together in 10 minutes and make it in time to do a quick walk on the treadmill before trying a new class called “athletic conditioning.” It's really just circuit training, but it gets me sweating so I'm happy with it. 11 a.m. — I'm so sad for everyone in Mexico that suffered from these last two devastating earthquakes. I was in a magnitude 7.6 earthquake when I was 11, and it was one of the scariest experiences of my life. There is no prep time for earthquakes, and there is nothing like walking around with your mom shopping for pajamas one second and the next, the earth starts to move under your feet and everyone is running for their lives. I research reputable organizations and donate $20. It's not a lot, but there is so much going on these days I feel like I am making donations every other week. $20 1 p.m. — My friend is getting married on Saturday, and I really need to get my nails done. I was going to try to go to my favorite nail salon in my hometown the day of, but with hair and makeup appointments that day too, I know it will be too crazy to also do nails. I look online for salons that do SNS powder gel and head over. I don't care what anyone says about SNS; it lasts three weeks with ZERO chips, and I love it. I also get a pedicure with callous remover because I need it! $80 5 p.m. — Read Money Diaries and drink green tea with popcorn. 6:30 p.m. — The subway really sucked this afternoon, so it takes me 45 minutes to get home instead of the usual 30. I stop at Whole Foods and buy more ingredients for the snacks and shakshuka, a weekly staple at our place; it's easy to make and is great for work lunches. I also buy kombucha and strawberries. $30.72 8:30 p.m. — It's been a cooking marathon tonight! I chop everything for shakshuka and while it cooks I make the snacks. I'm making a vegan recipe, so I use banana and coconut oil instead of butter. Only BF is strictly vegan, but I have to say it's very satisfying to find a delicious vegan recipe. 9 p.m. — OMG: BF makes a surprise appearance! I knew he was starting to miss me. We hang out, and he tries to eat all of the snacks I made, but I have to stop him because I want to share them at work! BF leaves to go back to his dog-sitting duties, and I watch an episode of that I've already seen a million times and go to bed. Daily Total: $130.72",3,221
"5:52 a.m. — For this 7 a.m. class, I've found that 5:52 a.m. is the perfect alarm time because I snooze until 6 a.m., then I need 10 minutes to get ready, and I'm out the door by 6:12 and there is usually a train when I get there and I make it with 10 minutes to spare before the class. Not getting a good spot for a class gives me so much anxiety. Sometimes I don't even go to the class if I'm going to be less than five minutes early. 9:30 a.m. — Yoga class and cardio were fab, and I'm feeling great today! I make breakfast and resist eating one of the snacks with every fiber of my being. I only have 10 left and haven't even shared yet. Whoops! 12 p.m. — I meet with some coworkers in the cafeteria for lunch. I eat my shakshuka with avocado, share the snacks with my lunch pals, and they are a hit. 5 p.m. —Green tea and popcorn time. 5:30 p.m. — I've had an iPhone 6s for almost two years now and am ready for an upgrade. I know I'm not going to splurge for the iPhone X, but with my plan I can make trade in for the iPhone 8 for the same monthly price I'm paying now. I have to pay upgrade fees and taxes, and I'll also have to buy a good case, but I'll deal with that once I actually get the phone! $103.66 7 p.m. — I get home and make leftovers for dinner; I'm eating shakshuka for the third time in a row, but I have a big weekend ahead of me — my best friend's wedding — and there will be a lot of expenses. 9 p.m. — I pack up everything I need for the big weekend and go to bed early. My dress is still at the tailor, so at least I don't have to worry about lugging it around tomorrow. Daily Total: $103.66",4,221
"5:52 a.m. — Gym time. I'm feeling super groggy this morning, so I buy a kombucha on the way to the gym. After class, I walk on the treadmill for 20 minutes. When I'm done, I head to the locker room to shower and do my weekly weigh in. Ever since I started doing yoga and eating more plant-based meals (thanks to sharing meals with BF), I have started feeling great. $3.99 9 a.m. — Breakfast with coffee. I'm trying to work more efficiently than usual since I have to leave early for the wedding rehearsal. 11:15 a.m. — I forgot my Spanx at my apartment, and I definitely need them for my bridesmaid dress, so I run to a nearby department store to buy another pair. $15.99 1 p.m. — I meet two coworkers in the lobby of the building and head out for lunch. I get two slices of pizza and we catch up and chat about work, eat, and enjoy the nice weather. My coworkers decide to get gelato for dessert, but I'm too full. $13.72 3:30 p.m. — I meet another coworker in the firm's cafeteria to catch up. (I want to get to know everyone better.) I bring tea from my desk and just ask for hot water, so I don't buy anything. 4:30 p.m. — Head to Grand Central to catch the train to my hometown where the wedding will be. I'm so excited for the weekend, I stop and buy a nice half-bottle of Sauvignon Blanc for the train ride ($14.09). I have an off-peak, 10-trip train pass I bought a while back, but this is a peak hour train and I'll have to supplement my pass with $5. $19.09 7:30 p.m. — The rehearsal goes well! The bride is really stressed out, but we manage to get everyone together to go through the motions of the big day, and I think everyone will be prepared. The father of the bride brought sandwiches for everyone, so we eat and hang out for a bit. Most of the bridal party leaves, but the bride and groom, and a few other bridesmaids and I head to the bar next to the venue for a post-rehearsal drink. I buy the first round. Hanging out with everyone is nice, but everyone around me feels so grown up with all of their baby and wedding talk; I start to feel restless. I'm so happy for my best friend, but I am ready for the responsibilities of marriage or motherhood. I need a break and ask my younger sister to pick me up. $26 9 p.m. — I'm definitely feeling the vodka sodas I just had, and my sister is also in a “fun” mood. She somehow convinces me to go out and drink more vodka in her room, but after being around all the “almost grownups,” I decide to join the recklessness. My boyfriend is working until midnight anyway, so it's not like I have anything else to do! My sister lets me borrow her clothes, and we pregame in her room while our mom watches TV upstairs. Feels like high school and I love it. 10 p.m. — We take an Uber to a bar about 15 minutes away (not like high school). After checking my credit card the next morning, turns out I spent $24 on drinks at the bar we went to. $24 11:30 p.m. — Eventually, I realize my sister is too drunk to be out, so I call an Uber to come get us. I also call my boyfriend to meet me at home, so I can stay with him at his parents' place where he is house/dog sitting. $14.72 Daily Total: $117.51",5,221
"8 a.m. — OOOF. Rough night. I wake up with a pounding headache and no idea where my phone is. I legitimately think I lost it in the Uber because I don't remember much. I'm also supposed to be at the hotel with the other bridesmaids getting ready, but I can't face them like this, and I need to figure out my phone situation. 8:30 a.m. — Luckily I have my Apple Watch, which still works with Wi-Fi. I text my sister and ask her WTF happened to my phone, but she is in a worse state than I am and has no idea. I text the bridesmaids that I'm running late but will stop by before my Drybar appointment at 11 a.m. I tell my sister to come pick me up so I can go pick up my bridesmaid dress at the tailor ($20) and so we can get hangover-fighting green smoothies ($7). $27 9:30 a.m. — We get to my parents' house and my phone is nowhere to be found! I try calling it but no answer. I can't believe I left it in the Uber. Especially since I just ordered a new phone and need to hand that one back to Verizon so I don't get charged! 9:45 a.m. — I drive to my boyfriend's house to do a last check for the phone — and ta-da! It's in a room I didn't check earlier. THANK GOODNESS! I text the bridesmaids that I am on my way! 10 a.m. — I get to the hotel room and hang with the bridesmaids, trying desperately to hide my hangover. Luckily, everyone is focused on the bride. I eat popcorn I randomly found in the car. I think I play it off pretty well, but I NEED coffee. 10:50 a.m. — Rush to my Drybar appointment! I park and pay $1 for parking. They offer me coffee! $1 12 p.m. — Honestly, I really don't like how my hair turned out. I look like a schoolgirl and the look just isn't working, but today is not about me and I don't have time to complain and fix it. I pay and head back because my makeup appointment at the hotel is next. $65 1 p.m. — Back at the hotel and everyone is in a frenzy trying to get ready. The photographer is taking pictures, makeup is getting done, people are getting dressed, the flower girls are crying and need attention, but there are mimosas and everyone is loving the excitement. I drink a mimosa, and I think my hangover is finally gone! 2:30 p.m. — Finally my turn for makeup. I honestly don't wear much make up, and I think $100 is a lot of freakin' money for it, but all the bridesmaids are doing it, and I'm a team player. The artist does a good job and even though it's not really my style, I look good! $100 3:30 p.m. — We dash to the wedding venue! The bride is trying her best not to cry and ruin her makeup, but it's all happening and it's so exciting! 5 p.m. — My best friend is married! The ceremony was beautiful, and the weather was perfect. The newlyweds are high school sweethearts, and my friend reads what she wrote to her hubby in their senior year yearbook; everyone cries, including me. As much as I shy away from grownup stuff like marriage, it's beautiful to see two people so happy together. 5:30 p.m. — We dance the night away, and it's a perfect night! My boyfriend and I give $85 to the bride and groom, but I pay $60 because he doesn't want to give more than $25. I don't feel like fighting about it, and she's my best friend, so I don't mind chipping in extra. I would give more, but I already spent so much on the bachelorette, bridal shower gift, dress, makeup. It's been a lot! Everything goes without a hitch, and the bride and groom are happy as can be. I join in on the after party at another local bar, but my boyfriend wants to head back to the city and I'm so tired, so we don't stay long. I say goodbye to the bride and groom and we head home. $60 Daily Total: $253",6,221
"10 a.m. — I'm tired but boyfriend and I eventually get out of bed. I make us his favorite vegan banana pancakes, and we chill and have coffee. 11 a.m. — It's supposed to be #SundayRunday, but we are too tired. We decide to just go out for a long walk, and my boyfriend shows me some of his favorite skateboarding spots. I have never been able to skateboard (and he has tried to get me to learn many times), but I love how passionate he is about it — and his resulting fitness isn't so bad either ;) 12 p.m. — We stop at a bakery I have always wanted to try and get a baguette and an iced coffee. We try to save the bread for when we get back, but steal a few bites on the walk back home. $7 1 p.m. — We stop at Healthnuts and get stuff for lunch and dinner — kale, chips, hummus, a cucumber, a six-pack of beer, and a few other little things. He pays and Venmos me for half. $20 3 p.m. — SO tired from that walk. We eat and then I take a nap. Not sure what boyfriend does while I nap, but he quietly hangs in the studio while I sleep. 4:30 p.m. — Boyfriend has to leave to pick up someone at the airport soon (the lady he dog sits and does odd jobs for), so we go for another little walk to the park and sit on a blanket with a beer. We try to play Frisbee, but it's unseasonably hot out, so and only go at it for 10 minutes. 6 p.m. — Boyfriend leaves for the airport. I make an easy kale salad and save the rest for lunch tomorrow. For dessert, I have chocolate I brought back from my recent trip to El Salvador. 10 p.m. — Bed time! Daily Total: $27",7,221
"7 a.m. — I was totally going to get up early to run, but I hit snooze for over an hour. Oops! I justify it because I've a head cold that I'm trying to kick, and my dog needs extra cuddles. Finally get out of bed and grab coffee I made the night before in our Keurig. (I drink my coffee cold because I grew up in New England.) Pack a bunch of snacks for the day, including a Chomps meat stick, an RXBar, and a Larabar, and head out the door for my 20-minute walk to work. 1 p.m. — We've had an all-day working session and are just now breaking for lunch. I planned to eat sad leftovers from last week, but my boss treats us to Chipotle. As sad as I am to throw away food, I'm not complaining about Chipotle! I get a sofritas salad bowl with spicy salsa, chips, and tap water. 4 p.m. — We've been working through deliverables for a big meeting this week and I know it's going to be a late night, so I sneak out to get Starbucks. The cashier accidentally takes two customers ahead of me, even though I was standing in line, so he gives me my drink for free! It was annoying to be ignored, but my grande coconut milk mocha macchiato is worth it. 5:30 p.m. — My attention span is getting shorter, so I take a quick break to buy train tickets to go to NYC next weekend. I went to school in upstate New York, but lived in Atlanta for the past two years. I'm so excited to see some of my college roomies! I buy two Amtrak tickets for me and my husband for next weekend, including a disability ticket for myself because the trip is more than two hours. I'll need an aisle seat to stretch my legs and back midway through our journey. $250 6 p.m. — Finally break for the night. I head to orientation for a mentorship program I'm doing to help first-generation college students. Even though I'm not a first-generation college student, I relate a lot to those students since I grew up on a farm and my mom didn't have contacts I could leverage to get a corporate job. Tonight's the first night and it's the mentors only, so we can get to know each other and learn the curriculum for the semester-long program. There are some sad looking sandwiches; I stick to water. 8 p.m. — The place is only about a mile from my apartment, but it's getting late and I don't feel like walking. Plus, it was freezing and the orientation was held on a rooftop; cool in theory, but definitely too cold this time of year. UberPool option is only 50 cents less than regular Uber, so I splurge. When I get the receipt email, it says I had a $4 discount code? I'm not complaining! $2.69 8:15 p.m. — When I get home, I'm starving! I reheat leftovers (homemade pizza with bacon jam, mashed potatoes, and scallions from last night), and then make coffee and a yogurt parfait for the morning. My husband and I watch a disappointing Atlanta United soccer game until bedtime. Daily Total: $252.69",1,222
"5:15 a.m. — I hate waking up early, but I signed up for a yoga class this morning. Although I'm a bit groggy, I really need a low-impact class right now. Ankylosing spondylitis is a condition that attacks my spine; my sacroiliac (SI) joints and lower lumbar spine are already “fused,” which means there is calcification over the joint and it is no longer flexible. If I don't work out, the fusions could continue, or the current fusions will cause pain as it's harder for my body to naturally pump fluid from my spine to my other joints. Right now, I'm able to manage my disease with exercise and medication, so I still feel lucky. 7 a.m. — Head into work early for a meeting. I sip my coffee during the walk, dig into my parfait at the office, and start working through a data visualization for our big meeting tomorrow. After working in a conference room yesterday, I'm happy to be back at my desk! I have a standing-sit desk to alleviate my back pain. The desk took almost three months to get here because the ADA (Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990) process took forever. There was so much paperwork that needed to be filled out by either me, my doctor, or my employer! 12 p.m. — I'm still super busy, so I eat lunch at my desk. I don't like wasting food, so I'm eating leftovers from Sunday night: rice pilaf, Asian pork, and a pineapple jalapeño salsa. This meal actually tastes great heated up. 4 p.m. — I leave work a little on the early side because tomorrow we have an early morning meeting. When I get home, I take the dog out and watch HGTV until my husband gets home. 8 p.m. — It takes us a solid two hours to figure out what we want for dinner. Usually I'd cook, but I have a head cold and don't feel like getting off the couch. We settle on cheesesteaks: he gets a classic one and I get balsamic brie. We debate walking the mile to pick up the food and end up deciding on delivery. My husband pays, but this will come out of our joint account. $25.64 10 p.m. — We watch random talk shows and catch up on our days. I have a glass of white wine even though I should probably be chugging OJ or tea. I also make my coffee for tomorrow. Daily Total: $25.64",2,222
"5:30 a.m. — My alarm goes off. I need to be at the office by 7 a.m. sharp, so I'm up earlier today. I pack my bag as quietly as possible but still manage to wake the dog. He stays quiet and I slip out of the door with my coffee by 6:30. 11 a.m. — Our meeting went great! As a bonus, my boss brought donuts from an amazing local place and Starbucks coffee. At this point, I'm over-caffeinated; it is probably a good thing because I think my head cold is getting worse. It's a little early for lunch, so I eat a Larabar I packed. 12 p.m. — My boss says I can head out early since I was in the office so early. I work through lunch, and snack on pretzels and Laughing Cow cheese I brought to tide me over. 3:30 p.m. — Home and I'm starving! I eat what's left from my cheesesteak from last night. 4 p.m. — My Peapod grocery delivery order goes through and will be delivered tomorrow morning. At first I thought buying groceries online for home-delivery was a luxury, but even with the delivery cost, it's still very affordable. The only options close to our apartment are Whole Foods, which is usually too expensive, and Trader Joe's, which doesn't have everything we need. We do a grocery delivery order once every 10 days or so. I typically look for whatever meat is on sale and build meals around that. This week, spaghetti squash and bone-in pork chops are on sale, so I get those along with apples, bananas, blueberries, kale greens, dates, scallions, oranges, parsley, pears, radishes, raspberries, strawberries, ground lean beef, vanilla yogurt, orange juice, frozen cherries, frozen edamame, unsweetened cocoa, cumin, sea salt, cinnamon sticks, cloves, unsweetened coconut, almond butter, and marinara sauce. $94.74 6 p.m. — Tonight, I want to use up the rest of the food from our last grocery order. I make creamed kale with shallots and roasted pork with onions. 7 p.m. — When we moved to Philly, my husband stayed with the same company but moved to a different department. He attends a lot more client meetings in his new role, so he needs more sports jackets. We look online for good deals and finally land on Macy's. He purchases three jackets for $229.96, but this comes out of his personal account. Daily Total: $94.74",3,222
"7:30 a.m. — I'm working from home today (yay) so I sleep in a little bit. I get to work from home every two weeks (per the ADA) to get my Humira shot. Yes, it's the same shot you see advertised on TV all the time — though the commercials fail to state that Humira is a HUGE EFFING SHOT that hurts pretty badly. For me, Humira stops my spine from fusing and limits my flare-ups. It does have some annoying side effects, especially fatigue, but I've really gotten my life back since I started taking it two years ago. I get up, wash my face, and start dreading my shot. 8 a.m. — It's shot time. I've had a needle phobia since I was a little kid (I had to get the rabies shots at two years old), and my husband still injects me. The shot takes about 10 seconds to administer and I don't trust myself to not pull it out. We start our usual shot routine: My husband gets everything ready while I blast Eminem's ""Lose Yourself"" to get myself pumped. The whole process takes about 10 minutes. I am prescribed Xanax since I have such bad shot anxiety, but I'm trying to use breathing techniques to make it through. Today is relatively uneventful (with a couple of swear words thrown in). Afterwards, I make some coffee to put in the freezer (I forgot to make it last night) and eat a coconut RXBar. 10 a.m. — It's a slow day at work and I'm a little jealous that my husband got work clothes last night. I browse thredUp and end up buying two jeans, a work dress, and a work sweater. I apply a $50 credit from a dress I returned a month ago. $53.63 11 a.m. — I need to be busy or else I buy stupid things. I was browsing Facebook and saw a great promotion for RXBars (my favorite). I get a variety pack of 14 for only $19.98! Just as I'm finishing the purchase, my groceries arrive. $19.98 1 p.m. — I get a few things done and touch base with my boss, who is on his way to run the Chicago Marathon. He tells me I'm good to sign off if I have everything done. My boss and I get along well, and he's great about work-life balance and helping me elevate my work. I finish off a few things and then get to cooking! I prep two spaghetti squashes and put them in the slow cooker for six hours. Then I make two batches of chai tea from scratch, which I love to drink in the afternoon. After, I make raspberry-lemon yogurt popsicles. I love having something sweet after dinner, and these are relatively healthy. I sample everything I'm making and eat a Chomps meat stick for lunch. 7 p.m. — My brother-in-law and his husband are in town for the weekend, so we meet up with them for dinner. We saw them a few weeks ago at our wedding, but it's nice to see them again so soon since they live in South Carolina. After dinner (which we split, coming to $33 plus a $7 tip for our half), we stop to get beer. It physically hurts me how expensive beer is in Philly, but I bite the bullet and get a six-pack of Stone Enjoy By for $19.99. $59.99 9 p.m. — It's a gorgeous night, so we all head back to our place and hang out in the lounge by the pool to talk about politics, parents, and pets — some of my favorite topics! We polish off a few beers and a bottle of wine I had in the house. (I'm very proud of my wine collection.) My BIL and his husband go back to their hotel around 11 p.m. and we go straight to bed. Daily Total: $133.60",4,222
"9 a.m. — The Humira shot I took yesterday was my last one, so I need to order more. Without insurance, the cost is about $12,000 for two shots; with my insurance, they're only $5. (Thank god!) I'm incredibly grateful, but the ongoing healthcare debate stresses me out. If they limit coverage for pre-existing conditions, I'm screwed. I buy the shots online and pay using my HSA account. $5 10 a.m. — For brunch, I whip up the spaghetti squash and meatballs I made yesterday, along with pasta sauce we already have. My husband and I chat while he slowly wakes up. 12 p.m. — Super embarrassing, but I've wanted to get the hair above my upper lip taken care of for a long time. I found a Groupon with great reviews and purchased it earlier this week ($151.29 with a discount code). Today, I'm going in for my consultation and I'm excited! My husband decides to walk to the appointment with me to explore the area. 1 p.m. — The appointment was quick and I'm excited! I meet up with my husband at the mall, where he bought a few pairs of pants on sale at Gap. I wander into Loft Outlet and buy two sweaters that are on sale. Afterwards, my husband buys a pretzel. I try not to eat any, but end up taking two bites. My husband wants to buy a smoothie but I remind him we already have all the smoothie makings back home. $50 3 p.m. — On our way home, we stop at Trader Joe's to pick up a few things I need for recipes: pizza dough, dates, and milk. We walk another two blocks home and I make us smoothies with frozen banana, frozen blueberries, fresh strawberries, and OJ. I also make myself a chai tea latte; surprisingly, it's delicious! I'll be remaking this recipe for sure. We waste the rest of the afternoon watching . I'm addicted to HGTV; what can I say? $7.49 7 p.m. — Some of our friends are heading to Applebee's for $1 margs and I can't say no. We meet them around 7 p.m. and walk the mile to the restaurant. Once we're there, we take turns buying rounds while we wait for our table. Once we get seated, we can take advantage of half-off apps! One of my friends and I split a pretzel with beer cheese, and my husband gets mozzarella sticks and a steak quesadilla. Some of the group goes out on the town, but the rest of us head back to our apartment. $36.80 9 p.m. — I whip up a quick sangria by cooking apples, strawberries, and lemon in sugar water and then putting the fruit and liquid in an ice bath. While it cooks down, I mix rosé and rum, and then add the fruit. We go to our friends' apartment with the sangria and our dog so he can play with our friends' puppy. I drunkenly tell everyone (about 10 times) that I want to be the modern-day Martha Stewart — minus the jail time. (Sober me still concurs.)

"8 a.m. — I drank LOTS of water before bed last night, so I feel fine this morning! My husband is still sleeping, so I go into the kitchen to start cooking. I make batter for Giddy-Up Energy Bites from my cookbook, which I love. (The batter has dates, cranberries, almond butter, walnuts, Nutella, coconut, instant coffee, and salt.) I make a triple batch and freeze the extras. I also put ingredients for mulled wine (apple cider, red wine, cinnamon sticks, cut up oranges and apples) in the slow cooker so we can sip on that throughout the day. Then I take out the pizza dough we bought yesterday to make another batch of the mashed potato, bacon jam, and scallion pizza. 10 a.m. — My husband finally gets up. I beg him to go to Whole Foods because I'm craving fresh pico and don't have any of the ingredients. I promise to bring the dog out the rest of the day and he agrees! He picks up the pico and I make us breakfast sandwiches (whole-wheat English muffins, eggs, goat cheese, and pico). After breakfast, I do some yoga stretches to help with my back. I'd usually go to a class, but I can't stop coughing and don't want to bother everyone. $4.29 3 p.m. — Some of our friends from the development stop by with chips and salsa! We hang out with them and play several rounds of the card game Exploding Kittens. It's been our go-to Christmas/Secret Santa present because the game is easy to learn and so much fun to play. We also drink all the mulled wine. 6 p.m. — Our friends head out and my husband gets back into the football games that are going on. He's always super into his fantasy team, while I couldn't care less. I clean up the kitchen and get started on dinner: Asian salmon in steamed bok choy wrappers. Dinner is a smashing success and we have lots of salmon left over. My husband continues to watch football and I watch a few episodes of in bed. I end up researching the Pillsbury bake-off competition and make a mental note to submit a few recipes. Daily Total: $4.29",6,222
"6 a.m. — Ugh. It's early but I need to get up. Two weeks ago, we were in a minor car accident and I need to drop off my car to get fixed. I get up, wash my face, and pack lunch. I don't feel like trying to divvy up the salmon or the spaghetti pasta, so I make a snack lunch of pretzels with Laughing Cow cheese, a few Giddy Up energy bites, a Larabar, and raspberry yogurt with granola. I leave all my work stuff because I'll have to come back to drop off the rental car. 7:30 a.m. — I get to the car collision place. They check out my car and guess that the back bumper and collision bar will need to be replaced (which goes to show you how hard we were hit). The car behind us hit our car twice because the driver “couldn't find the brake.” My husband ended up with a concussion and I got whiplash, but the car was actually in decent shape — or so we thought! We hired one of those billboard lawyers to help navigate the claims process, especially since we're concerned there may be long-term effects from the accident. After talking with the body shop folks, they set me up with the rental car place. The whole process is quick and within 20 minutes, I drive out in a Nissan Rouge. Everything will be covered by insurance, but the car requires a $50 deposit that will be reimbursed when returned. $50 8 a.m. — I get back home sooner than expected and have time to make a nice breakfast. I make breakfast sandwiches with goat cheese, pico, and an egg on whole-wheat English muffins. We eat breakfast while watching CNN and then head into work together. 9 a.m. — My boss is still in Chicago so I have a lot to cover while he's gone. I chug the rest of my coffee, put on some Latin pop music, and get to work. 12 p.m. — I'm shocked at how late it is! I got a lot accomplished this morning and still have a few things I'm hoping to knock out, so I work through lunch. I eat the snacks I prepared this morning. Halfway through lunch, the garage calls to let me know that my car will take about three days to fix (at no cost to me). 2 p.m. — A recent graduate of my alma mater reached out for career advice last week and I happily set up a call. It was exciting to be identified as a “successful young professional” worthy of giving professional direction. We chat for 30 minutes while I munch on a Larabar. 5 p.m. — Head out of work because my attention span is waning fast. I meet up with my husband to trek the 20 minutes home, where we have a ""free-for-all"" dinner — basically whatever leftovers are left. He settles for pizza, while I reheat some the salmon from last night. We hang out watching recorded late-night talk shows until he leaves at 7:45 p.m. for his soccer league. I go to the gym in our apartment complex and hop on the elliptical. 9 p.m. — When I get back from the gym, I take the pupster out and tidy up. One of my friends texts to let me know there's now an expansion pack to Exploding Kittens and I have to get it! It's available on Amazon for $14.99. When I go to buy the pack, I notice a few things in our cart from my husband — deodorant, shampoo, and dry Swiffer pads. I order everything, make my coffee for tomorrow, and go to bed! $48.99 Daily Total: $98.99",7,222
"6:40 a.m. — It's Friday so I'm allowed to work from home, one of the perks of my smaller biotech company. Everyone in my department works from about 6:30/7:30 a.m. until 3 p.m./4 p.m. so I'm up early with my coffee and cereal. I love my job; a couple of years ago I switched careers and got a salary bump. Because I graduated prior to meeting Eric, I used my salary to pay off my grad student loans last year. I'm also adding to our house down payment fund using my raise. Paying 20% on a condo or house around here costs at least ~$120,000, so despite our income, we struggle to meet our financial goals. I'll pay two-thirds of the mortgage payment due to my higher income but we just throw everything we can into the down payment fund at this point. I log into my credit card account and pay the monthly balance. We put everything on our cards to get points and cash back! $1,130 12 p.m. — I make a turkey sandwich and eat an apple, and remember to write Eric my monthly check ($980). Our financial situation is probably the most controversial part of our relationship (aside from the polyamory) as we maintain separate finances aside from the house and retirement funds. When we moved in together, we worked out how much we each spent; the check covers my half of the household costs for the month. It also takes into account that I pay for half his insurance since I have him on all my insurance (health, dental, vision, life, disability). Since Eric and I are married, people think maintaining separate finances mean we are selfish or juvenile. But we don't want to juggle multiple accounts, watch our balances, and check in all the time about spending. We both know how much we have in our accounts all the time, but it takes all the accounting headaches out of the finances to keep them separate. 4 p.m. — After work, my close friend comes over for a bike ride on our town bike path. We stop for oatmeal cookie ice cream ($4.75) and water ($2.25) during our ride, then end at her house where several other close friends come over. We order eggplant and pepperoni pizza (my part is $10) plus I buy wine for the group ($11.99). I ride my bike home; I always bike, walk, or take the T. $28.99 Daily Total: $1,159",1,223
"7 a.m. — I get up early and do our laundry, which costs $2 for each load on our second-floor landing. I save $1 on some of the dryer loads by hanging up my work clothes. I find they last longer that way. $5 12 p.m. — Eric and I take a long bike ride and stop to buy groceries for lunch (pork chops and quinoa and carrots) at home. Eric is a fantastic cook, so it's not a hardship to eat in. $17 2 p.m. — Eric takes the car to the mechanics. I'm like a 1950s housewife when it comes to the car; it's totally Eric's domain. It's embarrassing but I justify it with the fact that I rarely drive. Because of that, I pay for one-fifth of the maintenance and gas, and nothing for the monthly car payment or insurance. (It was $120 and dropped a ton when we got married, so I save Eric money.) The maintenance check costs $313, and my share is $62.60. $62.60 6 p.m. — Today is date night with a new guy I'm seeing. Somerville has a polyamorous community, and my goal is to have a permanent relationship with one or two other people aside from Eric. I broke up with an LTR partner recently so unfortunately, I'm back in the dating world. I'm not sure this will turn into anything, but we'll see. I walk into the square, which is conveniently close to nightlife, and we meet at one of the classier places for dinner. Good conversation, but I don't think I'm feeling it with him. At the end, I offer to split the bill but the guy insists; I know he makes a lot more than me so it's fine. We walk around the square and have fun pointing out how old we are compared to the college kids. He told me a story about being confused about Venmo, and I laugh since I still write checks like an 80-year-old. We grab drinks at another bar and I pick up the tab this time. I walk home around 1 a.m. $27.16 Daily Total: $111.76",2,223
"10 a.m. — Eric and I get up and eat bacon, eggs, and toast at home, then take a long hike. We swing by Starbucks after and I pay. It's kind of a waste of money, but I love my chai tea. $8.45 6 p.m. — My Starbucks pastry tides me over until Eric makes an early dinner of spaghetti, homemade meat sauce, and broccoli. He always makes enough on Sundays for either his lunches or our dinner until Wednesday, which saves money. We head out to our local indie theater in the square to see , a movie about a poly family. I pay for tickets ($20) and snacks for us ($9), and we love the movie. It makes me sad about not having another partner though. Eric doesn't care; he's not dating and hasn't in years, so he's not as wistful. We fall into the odd category of being a poly-monogamous couple, which is unusual. We started off both being poly but Eric hates dating and decided to quit. He's too introverted for it to be fun for him, which I get because I hate dating too, but I have always loved being in a serious LTR with a couple of people so it's worth dating to get back into a triad. $29 Daily Total: $37.45",3,223
"5:40 a.m. — Coffee and cereal at home. Since it's Monday, I take the T to the office at 6:45. I know I'll be I'm hungry later this morning, so I go to the corner café and get a muffin ($3.20) which is pretty much a daily thing. I also pick up a fruit cup for later ($2.65). $5.85 11:30 a.m. — Lunch at the office cafeteria, which is pretty outstanding. I always get a sandwich and a yogurt and either a granola bar or cookie. I used to be great at bringing food into work when I made less money, and this has become my biggest indulgence. I just don't make an effort anymore to pack food. Our household takeout food budget, which includes lunches like this, is shamefully higher than our grocery bill. Inertia gets me every time though. $10.47 5 p.m. — I'm heading home and I'm starving. Eric took the spaghetti to work for his lunch for the week, and he's working late today. I'm too lazy to cook, so I get us burritos from our local place. Eric thinks I'm a hero for getting him a burrito even though it's cold by the time he gets home. We have this quasi-embarrassing habit of eating in front of the TV and watching Netflix until I fall asleep, which is exactly what we do tonight. $19.04 Daily Total: $35.36",4,223
"5:40 a.m. — Coffee and cereal at home. I'm a creature of habit. I get to the office two hours after I get up; it was pouring so my walk to the T and the ride to my office were unpleasant and slow. I never take cabs or Uber though; they add up way too fast! When I walk into the corner café, the ladies get me a muffin as I walk up to the counter without me asking. I'm a baller. $3.20 11:30 a.m. — Lunch at the office cafeteria. Today's total is less since I've skipped the cookie. I know there's a social hour at work this afternoon and it's always loaded with food. At social hour two hours later, the catering is on point and I shamelessly grab food and leave it on my desk for later. I'm so proactive. $8.23 3 p.m. — My ortho takes my monthly payment out of my FSA account for my Invisalign. My teeth were always straight as a kid but they shifted as an adult. Since my work pays for a portion, plus I have adult orthodontics insurance coverage for the first time, I decide to get them. I'm on month four of an 18-month payment plan, no interest. My one regret is not getting this done prior to my wedding three years ago, but I couldn't justify the expense back then. 5 p.m. — I'm home and find out Eric has to work late tonight. I'm sort of annoyed I didn't know that before, because I could have either cooked or gotten a pizza instead of burritos yesterday. I get us a pizza and a salad. We're usually way better at cooking dinner, partially to offset the amount Eric and I spend on lunches at the office. $21.94 Daily Total: $33.37",5,223
"5:40 a.m. — Coffee and cereal at home. I go into the office, but no muffin today since I've stored pastries from yesterday's social hour at my desk like a squirrel. I score at lunch too because there's leftover catering which is pretty common in this office. I grab a sandwich and OJ and congratulate myself on being frugal. 5 p.m. — I have a couple of items to return at Ann Taylor. With my new job comes a wardrobe upgrade since the dress code is way fancier. I've spent about $600 or so on clothes in the past several months, which is higher than my usual budget. I take the T to Harvard Square and learn my items are in final sale mode and I can't get the full value back. Instead, I get $50 in store credit and then decide to check out the sale rack and buy a dress ($65 minus the $50 credit). $15 6:30 p.m. — I catch the T home, although I could walk. As luck would have it, a friend is on my train and I take it as a sign that we should get dinner together. She just moved into my neighborhood and is demonstrating why I like my area so much — I run into friends a lot in my small-big city. She offers to split the bill, but I know she makes far less than me so I pick up the check for dinner plus drinks. She doesn't know how much I make and I prefer to keep it that way. My income seems high on paper, but really isn't that great given our area and our crappy college housing. I don't like telling people what I make because it gives them the wrong idea. A lot of people don't know the income disparity between Eric and me and assume he makes a similar amount as I do, if not more; people estimate our discretionary income as way higher. $67.30 Daily Total: $82.30",6,223
"6 a.m. — I struggle to get up, feeling nauseous. I eat coffee and cereal at home and can't finish it, which is a major red flag since I am always hungry. I believe (and also can't believe) that I'm hungover from last night even though I drank so little. I rarely drink hard liquor anymore though, and our after-dinner whiskey drinks might be the culprit. I make it halfway to the train and decide to abort my trip to work. I swing by our local bakery on the way back to my place and get fortifications for the day, a piece of blueberry coffeecake and an apple croissant. I have conference calls from 8 a.m. to 1 p.m. with a small break, and I nurse the coffee and coffeecake at my home desk. $6.49 1 p.m. — Since I wasn't planning on being home, I need to run across the street to get lunch as we have no food at home. Eric will go grocery shopping tonight on his way home from work, but in the meantime I grab a tuna sub. It will last me two days since it's huge, so it's a pretty cheap lunch. $8.98 4 p.m. — Done with work for the day and contemplating heading back into work for the company's weekly free happy hour. Decide against it because I could run into my bosses, which is a shame because the amount of food at happy hour is always enough to make dinner out of. Last week was Indian themed happy hour and they had samosas, rice, chickpea curry, beef curry and chicken tiki masala. 4:15 p.m. — We're visiting my cousin who lives in the Upper West Side of NYC in a couple of weeks. I check out the plane, Greyhound, and Amtrak options, and end up getting Eric and I Greyhound tickets. Travel is one of the ways I splurge now that I make more; recently I treated Eric to a weekend in D.C. since I was at a work conference. My meals were being comped, and he could use my hotel room. I bought Eric's plane ticket and a lot of the food, but we don't spend money like crazy. It was still a relatively cheap vacation. $136 5:30 p.m. — Eric arrives, grocery bags in hand. (They cost $132, but that is covered in my monthly check to Eric.) I help him unload it and I give him extra gas money, as he's done more errands this week than usual for us. He cooks chicken and rice and veggies, and we unwind to some Netflix. $30 7 p.m. — Seeing new guy again. Eric and I were discussing his pros and cons, and I think I should give him another shot. He seems nice, and he's clearly looking for something serious. One of the downsides of being poly is that some people think it's like swinging or always casual, and for most poly people, it's not. Many people aren't just trying to sleep around, and you have to sift through people who are. I meet New Guy at a bar that has outdoor seating and I get a Dark and Stormy. It's unseasonably warm so we have a great time sitting outside and the date goes better than last time. Maybe New Guy is going to be Future Guy. I walk home at 10 p.m., which I can do since my neighborhood is safe and full of people at this time of night. $12 including tip Daily Total: $193.47",7,223
"6:15 a.m. — Wake up to my alarm, which is about five minutes fast. My friends make fun of the fact that every clock in my house is wrong, but it doesn't bother me. I enjoy the extra morning time and prefer believing I've slept longer. Before getting up, I take my temperature for my birth control app. About to finish my period so temperature is lower than usual; bring on the red days! Get up and feed my precious pup, let her outside, and start the coffee. Proceed with my morning routine of putting in my contacts, charcoal and normal brushing my teeth, mouthwash, and applying a homemade oil cleanser, apple cider vinegar and lemon toner, and moisturizer. I'm still on my period, so I take out and clean my menstrual cup. Let the pup back inside where she proceeds to gulp down the rest of her water. Fill it back up and give her some pets, she's a good pup. Get changed, reset the alarm for my fiancé, and kiss him goodbye. 6:45 a.m. — A kitty recently showed up on our porch and we've decided to keep her. She's meowing at me while I'm pouring my coffee into my to-go cup, filling my water bottle, and putting lunch (dinner from last night) in my bag. I figure she's hungry because her bowl's empty, but poor thing got diagnosed with worms and my fiancé has been feeding her a mixture of wet and dry food. Give her some pets and let her know he'll be up soon. Leave my house and start my commute. NPR and coffee coast me through my drive. 7:15 a.m. — About to arrive at work when my gas light comes on. I get off at my office exit and fill up. I only need to fill up once a week and my gas is super cheap because I drive a hybrid. $18.36 7:25 a.m. — Arrive at work, put my lunch in the fridge, and head to my office where I've got blueberry bars for breakfast. A few months ago, I started breaking out around my mouth. When the breakouts lasted for months and throughout my cycle, I looked up various reasons and discovered dairy. When I cut dairy from my breakfast (overnight oats with coconut milk, Greek yogurt, chia seeds, and fruit), my breakouts stopped. I've been meaning to sort out something else to eat besides these individually packaged bars, but life has been crazy! Mentally add that to my to-do list for this weekend. Plug in my headphones and turn on my almost finished audiobook by Ayobami Adebayo ( good). Tackle a design update our plant manager requested this morning. 9 a.m. — It's Halloween (muahaha) and I get a text from my sister-in-law in our family group chat with a picture of my niece in her costume. Am quickly reminded she's the cutest little being in the whole world and officially cannot wait to see her and the rest of my family for Christmas! 11 a.m. — Finish the update, email the new map and documents to the essential parties, and begin a second design update requested by the plant manager this morning. Get an email with the finalized quote from our wedding caterer. Some of the quantities and selections are incorrect, so I quickly edit the quote and send it back signed, requesting confirmation that we're all set on the changes. Finish my audiobook and start one of my favorite podcasts, . I pretty much love everything Guy Raz! is another favorite. 12:30 p.m. — Heat up my lunch, which is homemade mac and cheese with spinach and steamed cauliflower dyed green for holiday spirit! Eat and continue working at my desk. 1 p.m. — Finish the podcast feeling incredibly inspired. This episode was about Whitney Wolfe, the founder of Bumble, who left Tinder due to sexual harassment. She went on to create Bumble as a haven for women in the dating world and workplace. If I weren't happily engaged, I'd totally download the app. Girl power, man! Oh shit, realize I have a meeting, quickly fill up my water bottle and head over. 2:30 p.m. — Leave meeting, print some maps, and run into a few coworkers I haven't seen in a while. We spend time catching up, which is always nice. 3:30 p.m. — Finish second design update and leave work! My hours are really flexible. I choose to work from 7:30 am to 3:30 pm without a lunch break because I would rather miss traffic and be home with my love and pets! 4 p.m. — Get home, feed the animals and let them outside. Change, fill up my water bottle, and put on my favorite YouTube yogi, Lesley Fightmaster! She's very sweet and makes you set intentions before practices, and always gives a quote at the end. 4:40 p.m. — Feeling good! Let the animals back inside and hop in the shower. After, I fill up the sink with hot water for dishes and proceed to chop garlic and onion for tonight's dinner, Greek lemon and chicken soup! It's incredibly tasty and easy, and definitely a go-to comfort meal on chilly days like today. Toss the garlic and onion in the heated pot with olive oil to sauté, saving the onion ends and skin for veggie broth. Begin to wash the dishes from last night (unfortunately, we do not have a dishwasher), then add chicken breasts, chicken stock, crushed red pepper, salt, pepper, and one zested lemon to the pot to boil. Finish the dishes and set up the coffee for tomorrow. 5:45 p.m. — With my fella home, I finish the soup adding couscous, the juice of the zested lemon, and feta cheese. We settle in on the couch and watch the third episode of . 6:45 p.m. — Oh my gosh, that was so good and stressful! Currently sitting here feeling so sorry for Will and a little peeved at Bob's advice. I remind myself that he doesn't know the whole story. Our friends are playing a show tonight at a local bar. Sadly, part of my costume got lost this weekend at the Halloween party, so we dress as Deadheads instead because that's such a stretch for us ;) Fiancé puts the leftovers in containers for lunch and washes the pot. 7:20 p.m. — After an incredible parallel parking job by yours truly, we arrive at the show and see a bunch of people we know. We grab drinks (a beer for him, gin and tonic for me, fiancé pays) and catch up with all our lovely friends. 8:30 p.m. — Decide to head home after another round of drinks, dancing, and merriment! Fiancé pays! 10 p.m. — Home in bed, contacts out, big ole glass of water on my nightstand. Start cuddling with my fur babies and fiancé before falling asleep. What a lovely day!

"6:20 a.m. — Routine same as usual, except the kitty attempted to snag food from our dog's bowl while she was chowing down. Not the best idea, but fortunately nobody was hurt. I weirdly feel hungover. Fill up my coffee but decide to stick to the water on the way to work. 7:15 a.m. — Arrive at work and realize I'm out of breakfast bars. I walk over to the grocery store and on my way, hit my head on the same branch I literally ALWAYS hit my head on. You win branch, you win. Pick up my bars, avoid the gloating branch, and get back to work! $3.12 8 a.m. — Caught up with coworkers on their Halloween festivities while returning to the office. Everybody is working hard and constantly in and out of the office for fieldwork, so it's nice to say hi and reconnect. Sit down, eat my breakfast, and get to work on our weekly construction updates. 9:45 a.m. — Get approached about an issue with our digital maps so I work quickly to resolve it. I don't want to slow crews down! Finish weekly updates and summarize and share our progress with the essential parties. Since no one is editing our design geodatabase, I decide to do some maintenance, which is always better with a podcast: again it is! I honestly feel like my fiancé and I will own our own business one day. Both my parents are entrepreneurs, and my fiancé and I are hardworking and diligent. It's gonna happen! 10:30 a.m. — Finish maintenance and return to my current design project. I get an email from our manager with an amazing opportunity, but I wait like a minute to respond because I don't want to seem too crazy or desperate. Happy dance in my chair after saying yes! 11:15 a.m. — Fill up my water bottle and catch my reflection in the mirror. The flare-up I've been feeling from my cheesy weekend is making an appearance. , I tell myself. I grab almonds from my desk and snack. 12 p.m. — I'm starving so I warm up my leftover soup. After much back and forth, I get the official finalized quote from our caterer. Yay! Something checked off our wedding list. 1:30 p.m. — Fill up my water bottle and am so proud of myself for consuming so much water today! I'm still battling this headache though, and wishing I had some lavender to ease the pain. Realize I have Excedrin in my draw and take one before I finish catching up on episodes. After, I decide to stream old episodes of ""The Big Fat Quiz"" on YouTube. I love British television and comedians: Richard Ayoade, Noel Fielding, Jimmy Carr, Russell Brand. I think it's that beautiful mixture of self-loathing, intelligence, and complete lack of censorship that does it for me. 3:30 p.m. — Leave work, woot woot! 4 p.m. — Get home, feed the animals, change, and start a load of laundry with some homemade detergent. It's a beautiful day outside, so I take my doggo for a walko! Dog is officially acting ridiculous: so many smells, so much joy! I let her walk part of the way without a leash, and she's everywhere and anywhere all at once. 4:40 p.m. — Home. I open all the windows and doors because the weather is glorious. Move my laundry into the dryer and put a new load in the washer, then I turn on some yoga. During this entire flow, the kitty is bouncing off furniture and wrestling inanimate objects. She then runs full sprint into the guest bedroom door. My spastic animals are cracking me up today! 5:20 p.m. — Finish my yoga practice just when my love comes home. We kiss and catch up while I fill the sink for dishes. Proceed to wash dishes, set up coffee, and cook a dinner of roasted tomatoes stuffed with quinoa, spinach, and garlic. My fella puts on Widespread Panic from their Halloween run in Vegas. Nothing I love more than jamming out in my house on a beautiful day with the breeze coming through! My fiancé empties our scraps bin into the compost outside and continues working on a giant play-scratch house for the cat. (I find it incredibly sexy when he builds things! Especially sweet things for our cat who he loves and talks to so much.) Call my buddy who reached out yesterday but haven't spoken to in a while. We make plans to see each other Saturday. 6 p.m. — Load of laundry done, fold and put away the clothes. Transfer the second load to the dryer and water all the houseplants. My fiancé picks the last remains of our garden: jalapeños, tomatoes, and tiny bell peppers. Dinner is ready! We load up our bowls, grab a beer for him, red wine for me, and settle into the couch for . 6:30 p.m. — Dinner was delicious but I'm still starving. I peruse our food cabinet for snacks even though we don't keep much beyond my giant stash of dark chocolate. Grab some chocolate and the last pack of peanut butter crackers (sorry babe) and inhale everything. 7:10 p.m. — Finish the episode (so intense) and fiancé gets up to shower. Typically, we shower together but we're off each other's schedules this week. I get a text from my good friend that she and her fella are coming to town this weekend. Exciting! I haven't seen them in forever. Turns out Saturday is the best day to visit so we agree on then. Damn, our Saturday is jam-packed with activities now. Instead of canceling on anything or anyone, I just plan on overextending myself. I want to see all the friends and do all the things! 7:30 p.m. — Fine ass fella gets out of the shower and is all dried off… Sexy, sexy time! 8:15 p.m. — Fella decides to play video games while I stay in bed, finish my wine, and begin reading . 9:30 p.m. — Not ashamed of the fact that I pass out so early. I'm a grandma and enjoy my sleep! Also, I used to have sleeping problems as a kid and accidentally Pavlovian-conditioned myself to sleep with books and newspapers. Daily Total: $3.12",2,224
"6:20 a.m. — Wake up but since we left the windows open all night, I'm a little chilly. I get changed in the bathroom instead and check the weather, which is supposed to be great again. Also have a cycling class today so I pack a bag for after work. 6:40 a.m. — Hit the road and hear on NPR that the Houston Astros won the World Series! I'm not a big sports fan, but after Hurricane Harvey, I'm so glad that Houston has something to celebrate. Just yesterday, a dude on NPR was discussing what a relief the Yankees were in the World Series after 911. I hope the Astros brought Houstonians some joy and relief after everything they've been through. 7 a.m. — Oh man: Now NPR is talking about Trump and the poor victims of the New York City attacks. This morning's news has been an emotional rollercoaster; those poor families. 7:15 a.m. — Get into the office feeling upset. I'm not religious, but was raised so. Send out a “prayer” and meditation to the victims and their families. Get another design update and search the internet to lighten my mood. Obama promoting the ACA enrollment worked! 8:30 a.m. — Listen to an interview with correspondent Ashley Nicole Black. is a such great show, and it has a refreshingly feminist take on political satire. Finish design update, send out the necessary maps and documents, and return to my current design project. 9 a.m. — LOLOL but SAME to the internet's reaction to Beyoncé playing Nala in ! That whole cast is excellent! 12 p.m. — Fill up my water bottle, warm up my stuffed tomatoes, and send my fiancé a recipe for tonight's dinner: roasted eggplant, squash, zucchini, tomatoes, and toasted pine nuts over cauliflower rice. I was a vegetarian for five years, so I prefer allotting meat to one meal a day. This means rotating between meat and meatless dinners. Some weeks, we have more meatless meals because veggies are awesome and don't fart out methane! Turn on Derek Trucks Band to sooth my soul. 1:45 p.m. — Get into my almond stash; guess those tomatoes aren't too filling… Head to a mapping meeting after, then continue designing my current project. 3:45 p.m. — Sign off my computer and change into my exercise clothes. Head to the studio, fill up my water bottle, and start pedaling! 6:30 p.m. — DOG ATTACK! I pull into my driveway to my happy pupper! Say hello to my honey, who's washing dishes, and pour myself a shower wine. All dried off and slathered with coconut oil, I decide to do my morning face routine. I should regularly do this at night but I'm useless once I sit my bum on the couch. Throw the sleeping bags from when backpacked two weekends ago in the wash and fold and put away the towels from last night! 7:15 p.m. — Grab my wine and the giant blanket I've been crocheting and settle on the couch. Turn on and relax for the evening. My favorite episode, ""The Work Outing,"" comes on. I have seen this show so many times and still can't help laughing uncontrollably. 8 p.m. — My love is finished with dinner so he joins me on the couch, where we turn on . 9 p.m. — Show over, so much stress released! Love finishes washing dishes and I put the food in containers for tomorrow and set up the coffee pot. More sexy, sexy time because damn. Afterwards, he heads to the living room to play video games and I cozy up in bed before falling asleep. Daily Total: $0",3,224
"6:20 a.m. — Get up as usual but today's Friday! Best day of the week besides Saturday and Sunday. Before leaving the house, grab my reusable grocery bags. I need to grab fixings for tonight's “Our Parents Are Finally Meeting” dinner. 7:15 a.m. — Get comfortable at my desk hoping to finish my current design project. Coworker calls with a location issue and work with him to resolve it. Another coworker comes in with a mistake of theirs that needs immediate handling. 11 a.m. — Finally back to designing! Around noon, I heat up my leftovers and get back to work before another meeting at one. I'm back in my office by 2. and ready to buckle down before it's officially the weekend! 3:30 p.m. — Head to the grocery store and pick up a pork tenderloin, asparagus, a yellow onion, a lemon, bananas, and Monistat One because I'm pretty sure I have a yeast infection. $34.37 4:45 p.m. — Get home, feed the animals, and let them outside. Insert the medication, wash my hands, and quickly prepare dinner. I chose this meal because we had potatoes in the fridge that need to be used. Turn on the oven, dice the potatoes and onion and place them around the seasoned tenderloin. Toss the tenderloin in the heated oven and begin cleaning the kitchen. 5:30 p.m. — My fiancé gets home and decides to clean the guest bedroom carpet and sheets for a buddy who is staying with us this weekend. We were trying to leave for the dinner once my fiancé got home, but we found out today that our friend needed a place to stay. I turn off the oven and have a minor freak-out: I totally misread the diagram for cooking pork tenderloin and thought it was 20-35 minutes per pound — not the entire tenderloin. Bah, I thought I would finish cooking it at my parent's house. Fiancé grabs some craft beer and we hit the road! 6:20 p.m. — Arrive at my parents' house to a counter of booze. They're the best. We tell them my fiancé's parents don't really drink but they keep everything out anyways. My dad pours me wine as I turn on the oven and prepare the asparagus with olive oil, salt, and pepper. Future in-laws arrive with pie — and surprisingly accept wine. This should be a fun night! I lower the oven temperature and place the tenderloin and potatoes in with the asparagus. 7 p.m. — Take everything out of the oven and squeeze lemon over the asparagus. Dinner ready, us ladies and my fiancé head to the table. My father and future father-in-law are so immersed in conversation that they delay joining us. Good sign! 7:45 p.m. — Dinner ended up great with the pork not overcooked or dry. Hooray! My father teased me about potentially overcooking the meat and not preparing gravy. Who knew pork tenderloin needed gravy?! My father and I are the cooks in the family, but everyone loves the banter. I clean off the table and lovingly tell him he's a giant turd. Place the dishes in the glorious dishwasher, and grab the pie and spice bread from my parents. My mother brings out a bottle of champagne and very sweetly toasts us. 9:30 p.m. — After a truly wonderful night of introductions and conversations, we all leave my parents' house. There was even a number exchange for future walks and hangouts, which made me smile. 10 p.m. — Get home to our good friend kicking it on the couch. We all grab beers and end up in a deep spiral of comedic YouTube videos 'cause we're 12. 12 p.m. — Stumble to bed a little more intoxicated than intended! Daily Total: $34.37",4,224
"8 a.m. — The amazing opportunity with my manager is today and I'm hungover. Go me. Feed the pets and let the pup outside. Hop in the shower and chug glasses and glasses of water. My love is snuggled up in bed, but I wake him because we have a tight schedule today and I need him packed and ready! Proceed to make greasy breakfast burritos to cure us all: bacon, scrambled eggs, Greek yogurt, sliced tomato, shredded cheddar cheese, and ALL the Cholula. 9:30 a.m. — Pack my bag for tonight because we're staying with friends, and I request the boys' opinions for my professional meeting attire. The decision is unanimous. I put makeup on to look even more professional. Usually, I don't wear makeup but since my sister taught me how to do it without looking like an alien, I've actually been enjoying it. I'm even experimenting (via Birchbox) for my upcoming nuptials. I invite our friend, but he's broke and just wants to hang at the house. We ask him to water the plants and take care of the kitty while we're gone. Hit the road with my fiancé and doggo! 10:50 a.m. — Fiancé drops me off at the meeting and heads to our friend's house to relax and let the dogs play. Fortunately, I'm feeling much better and am able to drink the coffee provided. 12 p.m. — Head to lunch with those in attendance. I'm not really hungry since I stuffed my face with breakfast burritos, but I order a small Italian dumpling soup and a small salad. My manager pays for everyone. 1:30 p.m. — A good friend (whom we happen to be staying with) picks me up on her way back from the gym and we cheerfully discuss the meeting. I'm so happy to have been invited and am enthusiastic about my future with this company. We park her car a few blocks away and walk to the theater. (Literally can only say that in an English accent.) We're a little late and my friend still needs to buy her ticket, but I bought mine and my fiancé's a couple of weeks ago. 3:30 p.m. — Play finished, we hang outside to discuss our thoughts. Personally, I loved it and felt very emotional since the message was so strong but the others weren't so enthusiastic. I'm stifling tears here, people! 4 p.m. — Razorback house tailgate in full swing! My friend and I aren't big sports people so we chat and drink kombucha on her porch while our fellas and friends watch the game. All the dogs run and play in the sun. Kombucha quickly turns to beer and more people show up to the house, rotating between watching the game and hanging on the porch on this beautiful fall day! 5 p.m. — The friend who I made plans with earlier in the week shows up and joins us in the beer drinking shenanigans. Go ahead and feed my pup so she can continue playing with her friends! 7 p.m. — Starving and buzzed, my fiancé, buddy, good friend, and I leave for dinner. My friend only had a couple of beers and is playing a show tonight, so he drives us to the restaurant. Everyone orders beers and we decide upon a caprese salad, garlic bread, and a large supreme pizza for the table. 8:30 p.m. — After an incredible meal with fine folks, we order two cannolis and ask for the check. I pay $37.63 for our half of the meal, plus a $7.37 tip. My fiancé calculated the tip and I'm frankly surprised it's so low. We both worked in the service industry and typically tip over 20%. Had I realized this earlier, I would have changed it! My buddy has to leave to get ready for his show, but we plan on swinging by to catch his set! $45 9 p.m. — Walk over to our favorite bar for beers and pool. Some of the old gang is there and it's so nice seeing them again! Another friend joins us for a couple rounds of pool before we end up chilling on the patio. My friend's boyfriend and buddy meet up and my fiancé pays for his beers and mine. 10:30 p.m. — About to head to my friend's show when our out-of-town friends reach out, wanting to meet at another bar. I feel bad about missing my friend's show but am still glad I got to see him! We walk over to the other bar where a crew of people are hanging out! 1:30 a.m. — Drunk, happy, drunk. My fiancé foots our tap all night and I have a feeling the price is brutal. (He thinks about 50 bucks.) We sloppily say goodbye to all the beautiful people and hop in an Uber XL. (So wish we had Lyft!) I ordered a car large enough to take everyone back to the house ($13.14 fare with a $4 tip). Pass out after chugging water, knowing full well my desperate attempt to avoid a hangover is futile. $17.14 Daily Total: $62.14",5,224
"9 a.m. — Oh my fucking god what have I done to myself?!?! I wake up to hear my babe puking in the bathroom, and stumble out of the guest bedroom for more water — only to find my friend chipper and cleaning her house HOW?! I sit at her counter and discuss the incidents of last night as well as her miracle condition. Apparently, she didn't drink as much as we did, or drank more water? Anyways, I'm super jealous right now and shocked because I thought we all threw down hard last night. Her boyfriend is hungover, so we're not the only ones! Fiancé stumbles out of the bathroom and back to bed. Doesn't want anything but more sleep. 10 a.m. — After lying useless on my friend's couch chatting, my friend suggests running to the gas station for hangover supplies. I try to give my friend money for yellow Gatorade for my boo and something carbonated for me, but she refuses. She's so sweet. 10:30 a.m. — Get back to her house with Gatorade, a Perrier Sparkling water, and a coconut water-fruit punch concoction. Apparently, my sister called my friend trying to arrange brunch. Since my fella and I aren't feeling well I call my sister and let her know we're a no-go. We pack our things and take off so our friends can get ready for brunch. 11:30 a.m. — Home and our buddy is just as hungover as we are! We're the most responsible group of people. I grab one of the bananas and suggest the fellas eat one too, and go lay down with the curtains drawn, making a grocery list for later today. Debate tackling my work breakfast issue but since I had to buy extra bars this week, decide to finish my stash and come up with something next weekend. 12:30 p.m. — Hop in the shower to wash this filthy hangover off me. Reheat the pork tenderloin, asparagus, and potatoes from the family dinner. Sit on the couch with the boys and explore new music. Julie Byrne, anyone? 1:15 p.m. — Clean the kitchen, fold and put away those washed sleeping bags, and start a load of laundry. A few friends stop by and drop off our chainsaw. We stand on the porch chatting, “ignoring” the limb of the Bradford Pear screeching against the roof. (It will be sawed off very soon...) Once they leave, we return to our pitiful existence and stream more ! 3:30 p.m. — Head to the grocery store for this week's groceries: coffee, yellow onions, cauliflower, zucchini, lettuce, polenta, ground turkey, blueberries, mushrooms, grape tomatoes, avocado, garlic, lime, butternut squash, coconut milk, garbanzo beans and cannellini beans, fettuccine noodles, garlic bread, soy sauce, fish sauce, and two tubes of ice cream upon the fella's request. (We love the Talenti Sicilian Pistachio.) $91.11 4:20 p.m. — Get home and put away groceries. Sit around and listen to the fellas jam. 5:15 p.m. — Start cooking fettuccine with zucchini, garlic, and mushrooms in a red sauce for dinner. Add a salad topped with tomatoes, bell peppers, and sliced almonds as well as garlic bread. Plates full, we settle in for more ! We've officially decided to binge watch the whole season because we're hungover and it's incredible! 8:45 p.m. — What a season! Everyone's impressed. I put away dinner for lunch but leave the dishes in the sink and set up the coffee. It's daylight saving time so we adjust the hour on the alarm clock. The extra hour of sleep after this hangover sounds so nice, but going to bed knowing we're about to miss so much daylight in the afternoons is rough. 9 p.m. — Cuddling with my dog, I notice a knotted circle on her head. When we went backpacking we noticed a circle in her ear but assumed it was from an ember because the hair around was fringed. Show my fiancé and buddy and proceed to google ringworm on dogs. (I had ringworm as a child so any circular rash is an immediate trigger.) We decide to make a vet appointment for her tomorrow. Fall asleep having to keep my beautiful baby girl off the bed.

"6:20 a.m. — Wake up with the usual routine, but pack a bag for my cycling and barre classes today. 7:15 a.m. — Arrive at work and pull up my gynecologist and vet's websites. Plan on calling to make appointments as soon as each place opens. Unfortunately, the Monistat One, One Day Extra Strength didn't work well enough for me. I am due for my yearly checkup, though so the timing works out. Get busy on my current design project. 8 a.m. — Call my gynecologist and get an appointment for tomorrow morning as well as my vet and get an appointment for tomorrow evening. Good news! 9:30 a.m. — Finish my current design project. Now, I just need to create a set of map books and calculate the bill of materials. Coworker arrives with notes for a preliminary design. Apparently, we really need to finalize this design. This isn't really my fault, but I tell him I'll tackle the finalization as soon as possible. 11 a.m. — Finish the bill of materials and map books and send the information to the necessary parties. Proceed to calculate our leasing mileage and consumer data for this past month. Get an email from my manager requesting a similar data analysis. 12:30 p.m. — Realize it's lunchtime, and I heat up my leftovers from last week (veggie medley with cauliflower rice). 1:30 p.m. — Complete the data analysis for the leasing agreements and my manager. Begin the design finalization process. 3:45 p.m. — Sign off my computer and get changed into my exercise clothes. Fill up my water bottle and head to the studio! 5:30 p.m. — Wow that was a tough class! Feeling physically exhausted. Fill up my water bottle again and drive home, having to stop for gas. $19.03 6:30 p.m. — Arrive to my love washing dishes and defrosting the shrimp. Feeling really sweaty so I hop in the shower. Once finished, I toss our sheets and blanket in the washer to try and avoid contamination from the doggo and start cooking dinner. We're having creole shrimp with mashed cauliflower and roasted zucchini. Very yummy and comforting for the cold evening. Pour myself red wine to aid in the cooking process. 7:45 p.m. — Move the sheets and blankets to the dryer, finish dinner, and cuddle up on the couch to eat. Turn on the most recent episode of . 8:45 p.m. — Such a long day. I make the bed and decide to stay up and read  . 9:30 p.m. — My fiancé comes to the bedroom worried about a couple of spots on his belly — little red patches. We decide to have him swing by the doctor tomorrow and sleep with his shirt on. Fall asleep, a little more nervous about these skin issues! Daily Total: $19.03",7,224
"8:15 a.m. — My husband is in charge of getting the kids out the door to school, so I sleep in as late as possible and then hustle to get to work on time. On the way to the college campus where I work, I hit the McDonald's drive-through for a large Diet Coke and a sausage biscuit. McDonald's Diet Coke makes my morning possible. $4.74 10:15 a.m. — I have a quick break in between meetings, so I do a little online shopping. I'm one of those people that has finished Christmas shopping by October, but I see a Liverpool FC t-shirt my husband will like, so I order it and make sure it gets shipped to my office. My husband is a stay-at-home dad so he's home most of the day, which makes hiding online purchases tricky. We're really open about financial stuff, but the holidays are still a time for a little minor sneakiness. $27.50 2:45 p.m. — I'm in meetings all day, but am suddenly so hungry I feel like I might barf. I go to the cafeteria at school and get a cup of soup and half sandwich. I'm too hungry to be annoyed at how overpriced our cafeteria is for how boring the food tastes. $9 5:15 p.m. — Tonight is ""snack-dinner movie night"" at home. I make popcorn on the stove and a frozen pizza for dinner for the kids, along with a bowl full of Halloween candy to nibble on. They choose from OnDemand and I rent it for $2.99. My Friday nights are considerably less expensive than they used to be! $2.99 Daily Total: $44.23",1,225
"8:15 a.m. — The weekend starts with a trip to the YMCA. The kids go to the childcare area; two hours are included with the family membership, which is a great deal considering two hours of babysitting would run us at least $20. I hit the pool for some laps and buy a bottle of water from the vending machine when I'm done. $1.25 10:35 a.m. — My husband is working at his part-time job at a sporting goods store, so I drag the kids to Costco. We are out of basically everything, so I stock up on meat, toilet paper, snacks, vitamins, laundry soap, and more. After we shop, we hit the food court for the $1.50 hot dogs and share a $1 churro. I'm amazed at how easy it is to spend over $200 on food and household items. I grew up very poor, and was wildly in debt in my 20s, so sometimes it still feels like magic that there is always enough money in the checking account for groceries or whatever else we need. $254.89 1:30 p.m. — I take the kids to a private indoor park so they can run off some energy. While they play, I work on a freelance article. Even though my job pays pretty well, I feel more secure if I have extra money coming in, so I have a side hustle. I'll make $150 once the article is finished, so $16 for park admissions seems like a good investment. $16 Daily Total: $272.14",2,225
"11 a.m. — My husband and I try to make sure we each get some alone time each weekend, so I head out to a local coffee shop with my laptop. I get an iced coffee and work on my really terrible first attempt at a novel for a few hours. $4.50 1:15 p.m. — I found the perfect, cozy tunic-length sweatshirt top (with pockets!) on sale online a few weeks ago. At $14 each, I order two more colors and try not to feel crabby about the $7.95 shipping charges. I don't succeed. $37.84 1:45 p.m. — My gas light is on so I stop for a fill up of my 2010 Subaru. My car has been paid off for a few years now, and is quickly approaching 100,000 miles. It's been totally reliable, so I'm hopeful we'll get at least another five years out of it before we have to replace it. I've been trying to put a little money aside each month toward an eventual car replacement, but I still owe over $65,000 in student loans from grad school and undergrad so I have a hard time not wanting to throw all my extra money at those loans instead. $35 Daily Total: $77.34",3,225
"7:30 a.m. — McDonald's Diet Coke again. Hello, lover. I don't get any food today because I've been promised that there will be bagels at my first meeting of the day at work. I've never been one to turn down free carbs. $1.08 12:15 p.m. — I meet up with a colleague from another college for lunch. I get the salad bar and another Diet Coke. My lunch date is newly married and about a decade younger than me. We end up talking about kids (she's on the fence about having them) and I shock her by telling her how much daycare and preschool cost in our area. My daughter started kindergarten this fall and the fact that we no longer have a $904 monthly preschool bill has been amazing for our finances. $17.58 6:15 p.m. — I'm pooped when I get home and my husband is headed out to his drop-in art class ($20), so I make a last-minute dinner decision to get Chinese delivered. I order one soup and three entrees. We'll easily get three meals out of this, so I pack up some of the lo mein for my lunch tomorrow. $35.12 11:45 p.m. — My son wakes us up because he has barfed in his bed. My husband starts clean up duties and I drive to the drug store to get Gatorade and kids Pepto. I correctly predict that we are in for a rough night. I end up sleeping on my son's floor for most of the night. $11.63 Daily Total: $65.41",4,225
"11:45 a.m. — After a crappy night of sleep due to my son's stomach bug, I call in sick to work to catch up on sleep. Once I wake up, my husband goes to the YMCA for a run and I order delivery of soup and bread from Panera. I give my son some applesauce we got at Costco over the weekend and hope I don't catch his bug. $14.45 2:45 p.m. — I rent a Harry Potter movie for the sick kiddo and we cuddle up on the couch to watch it. I field work emails on my phone for most of the movie and remember to approve time sheets for my direct reports so they get paid. $3.99 Daily Total: $18.44",5,225
"7:45 a.m. — I get breakfast at Panera (a bagel sandwich and a Diet Coke) using a gift card. I use a credit card with rewards points for almost every purchase and then every couple of months, cash those in for a gift card to Target, Starbucks, or Panera. We never carry a balance on the card, so the $100 gift card feels like free money. I spend 30 minutes working on my novel before I head into work. 4:30 p.m. — After a stressful day at work, I do a little online shopping before I head home. Do I need $26 worth of new pens? No. But buying art supplies is soothing and cheaper than therapy. I also order a bottle of lube, grateful to the gods of online shopping that I don't have to buy that when I have my kids in tow at Target. $36.75 8:15 p.m. — My son's school is doing another field trip, so I tuck the field trip fee into his lunch box. We've been back in school for less than four months and this is his fifth or sixth field trip. I'm glad he gets to do fun stuff, but I don't know how some families afford the extras for stuff like this. The cost of this one is $5 for the bus, but we put in an extra $10 for scholarships in case there are kids who can't afford it. $15 11:45 p.m. — I get an email from Planned Parenthood requesting a donation, so I give $50. I'm trying to be more consistent in our charitable donations but we're still not as generous as we probably should be. $50 Daily Total: $101.75",6,225
"7:56 a.m. — Diet Coke and a yogurt from the school cafeteria. I really need to start eating breakfast at home, but school days feel a little chaotic and I try not to keep soda in the house so the kids don't ask for it. Thankfully, the kids both get breakfast at school (free for all kids in our district) so I don't have to worry about feeding them. $3.21 11:45 a.m. — My assistant makes a coffee run, so I give her $5 and she brings me an iced latte. Just the thing I need to get through a budget meeting this afternoon. $5 8:45 p.m. — Registration opens for some kid activities for the winter. I sign my son up for indoor tennis and a robotics club. My daughter gets tennis, ice skating, and community ed tumbling classes. I'm always trying to find the balance between not over scheduling them and giving them chances to try new things. I'm guessing I'll need to set aside another $50 for new ice skates for my daughter before lessons start. $260 9:15 p.m. — Last summer, we went to family camp for a week and it was amazing. The camp is super popular, so they hold a lottery for registration spots. I put down the $150 deposit and cross my fingers that we'll get lucky in the lottery. If we get a spot, it will cost us just under $2,000 for the week, but I've already got money set aside for that. I work over 60 hours a week, so I look forward to that vacation all year long. $150 Daily Total: $418.21",7,225
"9 a.m. — Wake up. Protein shake and coffee because I have a yoga class in a little bit and I'm feeling too lazy to make breakfast. 10:15 a.m. — First yoga class of the day. I pay $99/month for an unlimited membership, and I go as often as I can (which, on days I'm not working, is often twice). 6 p.m. — Second yoga class of the day. This was one was restorative which felt amazing. Note to self: take more restorative classes. I only wish I could double up like this and end every day with a restorative class. 7:45 p.m. — Right after yoga, I drive over to a new client's home. I'm designing Salsa competition shirts for a new Oakland dance company (it's the first LGBTQ performance and competitive team in the area). I've emailed, texted, and spoken with the company owners, but this is my first face-to-face with them. They're rad, we totally gel, and I'm excited to get my velvet and rhinestone on. 9 p.m. — One of my friends is getting married tomorrow at San Francisco City Hall, and I've decided to hit a store that's still open to see if they have anything I'd want to wear. I tried on a bunch of stuff, but everything was ugly and not worth the money. 11 p.m. — Home and beginning to wardrobe plan and pack for the next couple of days. I'm heading to L.A. for a table read of a film I'm producing in the spring. It's a quick trip, only 30 hours, and I'm trying to figure out how to get everything into a large tote bag (I hate, hate, HATE carrying anything unnecessary with me.) This includes deliberation about what to wear to the wedding, if I can go to the airport directly in it, etc. Silently thanking my mom for all the fancy skincare samples she passes on to me, because this way I don't have to buy anything TSA-approved. Daily Total: $0",1,226
"12 p.m. — Call a Lyft Line to take me to my friend's wedding. (I should say wedding, because I'm friends with both the bride and groom.) I was able to fit everything for L.A. into a tote that fits under the airport seat (small victories!) and plan to change out of my wedding garb as soon as the ceremony is over. $15.30 1:15 p.m. — City Hall is super backed up; apparently, the Monday before Thanksgiving is a popular day for folks to get married. I'm starving and so are my friends, so we wander outside of City Hall and across the street to the hot dog vendor, where I buy an insanely overpriced Louisiana Hot Link. I'm still hungry afterwards but refuse to buy another. $6.75 3:45 p.m. — The wedding ceremony is over, much later than anticipated, so I have to ditch the post-wedding happy hour and get myself to the airport. It works out well because another friend/wedding attendee has to drive *right by* the airport, so he agrees to drop me off. We both need a little pick-me-up so we stop into Philz Coffee before hitting the road. I pay as a thank you for the ride. $13 5 p.m. — At the airport, through security, and still hungry. I cave and go to Cat Cora in the airport next to my terminal and get a soup and salad. Annoyed at airport pricing, but I should've planned better. I'm usually all about bringing my own food/drinks on airplanes (I fly WOW and Norwegian and Spirit a lot, so I'm used to it; I self-fund creative projects so I need to be as thrifty about my travel as possible) but today I've majorly failed. $15.31 6 p.m. — I grab a decaf coffee to slam before getting on the plane. $2.50 9:30 p.m. — Made it to L.A.! An ex picks me up from LAX. (Funny story: I never got airport pickups when we were together. Our split was friendly, and now I sleep in his living room when I'm in L.A.) We hit Petty Cash Taqueria, get spicy margaritas, tacos, and a quesadilla. I'm exhausted, so we split the bill and decide to call it a night. $50.13 Daily Total: $102.99",2,226
"8:30 a.m. — Wake up and drink a protein shake that I brought with me from home. Ex-BF works just as much as me, if not more, so he doesn't really have anything in his fridge either. 10 a.m. — Meet up with a friend at a nearby Coffee Bean, where I get a large iced coffee. I met this friend through work a few years back; she was an actress on one of the first films that I costume designed. I saw her a couple of weeks ago at a premiere for said film, and now I finally get to meet her almost one-year-old twins! $4.31 12 p.m. — Our coffee hangout turns into lunch at The Farmers Market at the Grove. I grab a chicken salad and we continue to catch up and talk shop (film) until I have to leave to meet up with the writer-director of the film I'm producing. $14.32 1:15 p.m. — Realized I didn't have my notebook with me so I needed to get a Lyft back to ex-BF's place so I can take notes at the table read. $5.60 1:30 p.m. — Grab an Uber to the table read (graciously hosted by one of the writer-director's friends). I did a table read of this script a few weeks ago in Paris with other filmmaker friends because we needed to get a rough estimate on timing. (The script is very dialogue heavy.) This will be the first read with actual actors, so I'm excited to see what they bring to the table. A huge plus is that one of our readers today is a good friend I haven't seen in over a year, and it'll be nice to give him a hug and catch up. He and I have both had a big 2017, and there's a lot to fill in. $8.80 5 p.m. — Head to a Mexican restaurant with the writer-director, and some of the other people from the read. I grab a tequila and share in the table's chips and guac. We end up talking for hours about the script and project. I was already excited about it, but I'm glad to know that other (accomplished!) film professionals believe in it as well. The writer-director picks up the bill for the entire table. 7:30 p.m. — We could all talk forever about this project but the restaurant has gotten too loud with a terrible cover band so we decide to part ways. I grab an Uber back to ex-BF's place. $4.17 9 p.m. — Should've actually eaten more at the post-read discussion. I briefly consider just drinking a protein shake, but in the end real food wins. I order a burger/salad thing from The Counter, which is walking distance. Spend the next couple of hours drinking ""birthday champagne"" (a bottle of Veuve Cliquot that ex-BF got as a present a few weeks ago) and catching up on work and life (mostly work) while half-watching the second season of a YouTube Red show that he produced and I worked on when we first met. I'm already dreading my 3:30 a.m. wakeup, so it's bedtime for me. $14.94 Daily Total: $52.14",3,226
"3:45 a.m. — Leave for the airport. My flight isn't until 7 a.m., but it's the day before Thanksgiving. I'm chronically early for things and the airport is no exception. I've missed flights before so I err on the side of very early when I can. Plus, my mom sent me a picture of L.A. traffic and I haven't been able to check into my flight online. $28.90 4:45 a.m. — FUCK. So the reason I couldn't check in to my flight is because Spirit automatically canceled it, so I'm stuck buying a new one-way ticket. When I first bought the round trip ticket, I didn't know about my friend's wedding (it was a last-minute thing). I ended up having to use flight miles to book a later flight out so I wouldn't miss the wedding. Apparently, when you miss one leg of your flight on Spirit, they auto cancel the other flight(s). Is this a thing? I want to get mad, but I just pony up the new fare and get through security. $76.20 5 a.m. — This morning isn't the best. I left my protein shake powder at ex-BF's place and I'm starving, so I grab an overpriced breakfast at Rock & Brews at LAX and watch on my phone while I wait for my flight to start boarding. I'm kicking myself for how expensive this 30-hour L.A. trip has been, but decide to stop beating myself up and travel prepare like I usually do for the next L.A. jaunt (mid-December for a SAG Indie workshop). $21.51 8 a.m. — Back in Oakland! Grab a Lyft from the airport and go home so I can pass out for a few hours. $10.10 4 p.m. — Wake up super groggy, throw on yoga clothes, and head to the fabric store and pay for parking. I'm sourcing the fabric for the salsa team's costumes. I walk in and am told they're closing at 4:30, because tomorrow is Thanksgiving. I'm usually much better about double-checking closing times for stores (mostly because I hate driving and sitting in traffic), but I didn't even think to today. Do a quick walk through and see that there isn't any fabric in stock that I can use for the costumes. It really hasn't been my best day. $1.50 4:30 p.m. — Now I've got a bunch of time on the meter and lots of time to kill before yoga at 6:30. I walk to a nearby coffee shop and grab a coffee and something to snack on while I catch up on podcasts (and people-watch!). This coffee shop is really close to U.C. Berkeley, so there are a bunch of students studying. Every time I see students studying in a coffee shop, I say silent thanks that I finished school years ago. $6.23 5:30 p.m. — I still have some time to kill before yoga, so I switch to trip planning mode. I'm co-planning a MLK Jr. weekend trip to Tahoe with some pals. The other host was able to book one suite through her timeshare, but since it's a holiday weekend, a second suite isn't available unless we book at a regular rate. I choose a six-person suite and put down the deposit. $400 6:30 p.m. — First yoga class of the day. It's been really nice to get back into my practice. I've had to sit out most of this year because I wrecked my back pretty badly earlier this year in a car accident. Some days are more pleasant than others, and today I definitely bring all my BS from the day onto the mat. The class is hard — mentally — to get through. 8 p.m. — Second yoga class of the day: a yin class to balance out the vinyasa flow class I just did. I thought the yin would help my mental state, but I couldn't calm down or enjoy the practice like I usually do. Daily Total: $544.44",4,226
"11 a.m. — It's Thanksgiving! My friend from L.A., the one with twins, gave me a bunch of baby clothes to bring to our friend who conveniently lives close to my parents, so I'm stopping by her house en route to my family home. It's my first time meeting her little one, so we spend a couple of hours catching up and playing with her son. 1:30 p.m. — At my parents' house. I saw them a few days ago for an hour or so, but this is my first time actually getting to hang out and chat since August. We only live 30 miles from each other, but we're all often traveling so it's not uncommon for us to be on different continents at any given time. I chat with my mom as she finishes making dinner and shop YogaOutlet's Thankful Thursday sale. I'm planning to do a yoga teacher training in early 2018, and my yoga wardrobe is very limited so I decide to take advantage of the killer prices and stock up. I get four pairs of yoga pants and three crop tops/bras. $113.91 6 p.m. — Still catching up! I fill them in on my seven-week Europe trip and they tell me about the last few weeks away. They bought a second home about 10 years ago with the intention of settling there when they're done with traveling all the time. I mention the yoga teacher training to them because I'm trying to figure out how to swing the cost of the three-and-a-half week program ($3,000). I won't be able to work during those weeks (no paid vacation because I'm a freelancer). I already have a lot of planned travel coming up in 2018, so I'm just trying to wrap my head around everything. My dad kind of scoffs at doing a yoga certification in San Francisco instead of in India (he was an Aikido practitioner for over 30 years and has trained in Japan, so I get where he's coming from). I make a mental note to check on the pricing and availability of programs in India when I get home. 11 p.m. — Last Black Friday purchase: I buy a pair of black high-waist jeans with sailor buttons (stoked!) and fresh tortoise shell cat eye sunglasses, and go to sleep. $56.81 11:05 p.m. — Just kidding about those clothes being the last purchase. I buy gnome rubber ducks to send to friends under the name of an inside joke I have with friends. (Gnomes aren't unusual for me; I collect them.) They'll get them on Saturday. I love Amazon Prime. $7.99 Daily Total: $178.71",5,226
"10 a.m. — Sleep in and finally roll out of bed to make breakfast. I work so much and it's not unusual to put in 70-plus hours in a week. On off days or weeks, I try to sleep and stay in as much as possible. I do a quick scramble with eggs, spinach, and bacon. I buy these at Costco every few weeks and I only cook for myself, so the cost is negligible and each haul lasts me a few weeks. 12 p.m. — Yoga! The class is packed; everyone is stoked to be there after feasting the day before. This class is with a teacher I've never had a class with before and it totally kicks my ass. Love it! 2 p.m. — Home and checking out yoga teacher training programs in India. I've found a ton in Goa and they're less than half as expensive as doing the certification in San Francisco. Even with the flight, it's about a $1,000 savings. I send an inquiry to the school I'm most interested in, and an email to a friend who lives in New Delhi (yes, I know it's nowhere near Goa) to see if he'd like to go on an adventure at the conclusion of the training. 8 p.m. — Eugh. Feeling SO lethargic because I've spent the last couple hours Netflixing. My friends told me I needed a hobby outside of work (ha), so I've been toying with the idea of designing a simple accessories line. In between dropping out of school and starting fashion school in San Francisco, I was making and selling handbags and clutches. I haven't done it since 2009, but my skills and taste have elevated, so maybe it's time? I sketch and research materials for the next few hours. If I do it, it'll be a nice brain break from the design work I do for film and commercials. Daily Total: $0",6,226
"9 a.m. — Wanted to sleep in longer but that wasn't in the cards. I lay around for a bit and finally get up because I'm starving. Eggs, spinach, bacon, coffee. I'm a creature of habit when left on my own. My work life is so hectic, so I prefer to keep things easy when I'm not working. That, and I'm the laziest person I know when I'm ""off."" 12 p.m. — Yoga! Class today with my favorite teacher. The flow kicks my ass but I'm in a much better mental state today than I've been during the practices earlier in the week. And I can do an unsupported bridge again! This is a huge accomplishment for me, because just a few months ago I couldn't even sit or stand without pain, exhaustion, and a brace. 1:45 p.m. — Head to the grocery store after yoga/before going home. I'm out of coffee and also need to get some Stevia drops. The coffee (Intelligensia) is pricey — usually I find it on sale, but no such luck today. It'll last a while since I'm the only person drinking it. As soon as I get home, I make some bulletproof coffee for an energy boost. $18.98 3 p.m. — Flipping through Instagram and I see one of my favorite accounts (@garancedore) posted about the book, . I immediately click onto Amazon and buy it. $5.74 3:05 p.m. — As soon as I bought the book, I remembered I needed to get a gift for an upcoming annual White Elephant gift exchange. The rules changed this year: no more gag gifts and only useful items. I was annoyed but realized it makes total sense — no use in wasting money on things people won't use. (Damn getting older and more sensible!) I look through Amazon's Black Friday deals and choose a rad backpacking double hammock. There are several backpackers in this friend group, but I'm secretly hoping I end up with it. $34.95 4 p.m. — Realize that I need to replace my planner and Moleskine notebook soon. I'm super analog when it comes to scheduling, note taking, and lists. Go to reorder my usuals, but I'm annoyed at how expensive they are. Decide to do some comparison shopping and look at notebooks/planners from Muji, but I can't make up my mind. I end up not buying one. 8 p.m. — Dinner with my landlords! I've lived in my building for five years and my landlords live in the building. We've gotten pretty close. We all have crazy work commitments so hanging out doesn't happen very often; the last time was back in September before I went to Europe. They're chefs, so I know whenever we go out the food and wine will be great. They choose a hot pot/steam restaurant in Oakland, and I defer to them for all ordering. They pick up the bill. They always do; they're really generous and giving. Daily Total: $59.67",7,226
"5:30 a.m. — Wake up and caffeinate self from the coffee machine in the kitchen. Trip over unidentified body spread out over living room floor, and realize it's my sister seconds before I call the police. I wake her up and send her to make pancakes while I shower. Her having a key might be a good idea after all... 7 a.m. — Hurrah, I'm out of the door on time! I leave my sister (somewhat) awake and remind her she has a couple of classes today that she really isn't supposed to miss. Make a mental note to add ""Surrogate Mom"" to my job description when our mother is out of town. Get on the train into London with my contactless bank card. The fact I never spend cash on traveling makes me feel slightly better. The fact I'm pushed nose into armpits the entire commute makes me feel less so. Arrive at work without forking out any money on additional coffee or breakfast or Random Amazon Purchases! $8.99 8:30 a.m. — I started a small startup with a great coworker about two years ago. At the moment, it's just the two of us and an admin assistant, which works well because we get on great! Anything above salaries, office hires, administrative supplies, and a small reserve fund gets split equally as ""bonuses."" So far, we're breaking even and are even considering branching out and hiring more, which I consider a plus. The admin assistant (we'll call her A.) brings in Starbucks for the two of us and puts it on a company card. My business partner (H.) is away for the next couple of days so it's just two of us in the office. 11:15 a.m. — After a morning of staring at a computer screen and writing policies, I need to get outside. A newish client of ours calls and asks to meet up, so I head out. The client runs an IT startup and has an issue with a new staff member. We walk around a central London park for a couple of hours and I run down what he needs to do legally, and what I would do in the situation. He seems remarkably happy with the outcome and leaves happy. While we are walking, I buy us coffees from a vendor but they don't have receipts so I can't claim. Doh! $9.12 2 p.m. — Get back to the office and eat a KIND bar and a satsuma. We don't usually claim anything other than coffees or client lunches, but we each bring in random crap from time to time and chuck it in a free-for-all pile. (Except chocolate: Those babies stay right in my desk where they belong!) 4:45 p.m. — I don't usually leave this early but there's such a thing as too many emails, and I've hit that ceiling for the day. Plus, I have plans. I grab a brie and cranberry sandwich, a Diet Coke, and carrot cake bar from the shop on the way to the tube ($4.69) and then get myself across London to my next destination ($3.75) $8.44 5:30 p.m. — On Monday evenings, I tutor as part of a disadvantaged kids scheme in a rougher area of the city. I take a group of six 13-year-olds in math for an hour or so, and then swap and get six 15-year-olds in history. Their behavior isn't the world's greatest, but it makes the victory sweeter for me when they understand a concept. After we finish, I grab a slice of pizza the organizers bring to bribe the kids and reward the staff, and chat with a few other tutors. We arrange to go out for drinks after a volunteer meeting on Thursday. 8 p.m. — Home! It's a stressful commute because my mother just arrived back in London and can't figure out how to use Uber. (I've only demonstrated 100 times!) I tell her where to wait, what the Uber will look like, and what the reg will be, and she still manages to miss it...twice. When she's finally in the car and I've paid two $6.70 missed fees, she calls me and tells me (loudly) how great her flight was and how unhappy the driver looks. (Wince.) Well, I guess that's bye-bye to my five-star Uber customer rating. Her ride comes out at $41.02, plus the late fees. At least my Contactless caps, only charging me $5.63 for the way home. $60.05 10 p.m. — Get home and realize my sister has left with my favorite PJs and all the 50 ps from my spare change jar. I should probably set some ground rules, but honestly I'm used to it now. And I love her. trust me: I'll make her pay when she gets a job. I eat all the leftover cold pancakes from breakfast because I'm gross like that and super hungry. Roll into bed without spending more money! Daily Total: $86.60",1,227
"4:45 a.m. — Wake up ridiculously early and go for a run. Afterwards, I feel like a champion athlete who has her life together and knows exactly what she's doing. Seriously hoping I don't trip over anything and ruin the illusion. Make a smoothie with spinach, bananas, raspberries, pears and almond milk. Eat a slice of sourdough bread with avocado and Marmite. 7:45 a.m. — Today is a Birmingham day, and just in case you ever considered commuting halfway up a country multiple times a week, don't. My train goes from the local station though, so I don't have to go via London! The tickets are bought by the company several weeks in advance. I plug headphones into my laptop and continue with the super-fun policies I am drafting. 9:30 a.m. — Here's the deal with the commute: A fair deal of our clients are based here in Birmingham and being able to meet at a moment's notice is important for the business, so I position myself up here a couple of times a week. We can't afford office space though, so I normally park out at a cute independent coffee shop and move around as the day progresses, depending on what the clients need. I greet the friendly waitress and the owner, hook my laptop to the Wi-Fi, and check my schedule. I have three appointments today, and all three will meet me here. I order a water and a latte, but they will bill me at the end of the day. 4 p.m. — All three appointments and the policies are done, and I'm feeling super accomplished. Throughout the day I've gotten through two lattes, a panini, a muffin and at least five waters. Goodness knows what the clients ordered, but I pick that up as well. The total comes to $34.04 which goes straight on the company card, but I tip $13.40 because I understand how annoying it is to have someone invade your coffee shop for seven hours straight. $13.40 4:15 p.m. — A. calls me as I leave the coffee shop, and she has H. on conference. We talk shop for a good while and I browse the shopping center by the train station since I have some time. I'm all kinds of distracted, but Black Friday lasts a week in the U.K. and I manage to grab a great deal on a new work blazer ($46.89) a pair of Vans for the sister for Christmas ($40.19) and some gourmet lemon and black pepper popcorn ($6.43). I decide that's enough damage for now and hop on my train, still on the phone. $93.51 6:30 p.m. — Still on the phone when I get home, and am getting slightly annoyed. H. and A. seem to be having some long boring conversation about billing (yes, I know I should care, but I honestly don't). Eventually, I put them on mute and start cooking. I'm starving. I make a massive pesto pasta dish and convince myself that because I put mushrooms and asparagus in, I've earned the carbs. The conversation ends and my phone loads all the WhatsApp messages I've missed. One is from a great friend/FWB asking if I'm free. Um, yes? I put on something nicer than I'm wearing currently and tidy a bit before he heads over. We bed down early, since I'm exhausted. Daily Total: $106.91",2,227
"6:30 a.m. — Ah, sleep! I feel refreshed and the fact that my FWB brings me coffee in bed only amplifies this. FWB is working from London today too, but he's driving in so I ditch the underground and grab a ride. H. is back in today and I try to get in first. Success! A. brings Starbucks and we start the day with the completion of the billing conversation from yesterday. I try to contribute, and fail. 11 a.m. — Work, work, work. Today I have lunch with a potential client, and I spend most of the morning researching his company. Seems like it would be my dream job if I weren't doing what I am. A. stops by my desk for a catch-up and seems deviously interested in my night with the FWB. She asks if I'm interested in anything more than the somewhat frequent nights we've been having as of late, and I'm not so sure. I've been close friends with the FWB for years now, and don't particularly want to screw it up with the whole relationship thing (which I'm not great at, tbh). 1 p.m. — Lunchtime, and boy, is this guy cute! We chat and flirt and generally have fun for the entire hour, but I'm slightly dubious of taking him as a client, because of legal concerns I have about the way his company operates. I explain this to him, and he offers to take me out to drinks to discuss it. Um, awkward? But sure. We make time on Friday night. We ate tons at the sushi place we are at, but he grabs the bill before I can, and tells me he'll write it off as a business expense. Fair play. 6 p.m. — I wait for the FWB for a ride out of the city, and we stop on the way back at our local ice rink. We both have unlimited passes and keep our skates at the rink, so it's normally a spur-of-the-moment thing. I used to skate semi-professionally and so did he. (It's how we met and became friends!) Now we just use it as a fun way to work out and (literally) chill. We grab burgers on the way out; he pays. 9 p.m. — Completely forgot my mother and sister were heading over for a late dinner, and quickly order Dominos. Alas, I am full from my burger, but I get to watch them eat (and steal the best slices for breakfast in the morning!). We catch up on and I catch up on a few work emails and texts. After they head home, I crash into bed. I only paid for a pizza today: I am a money-saving ninja. $20.10 Daily Total: $20.10",3,227
"7:45 a.m. — It was a BAD morning... I remember little, but my bank statement tells the sad tale: One large coffee on the way to work ($3.75), the commute itself ($9.11), and another coffee and croissant near work ($9.25). I look like hell in the mirror, and am wondering if this is a sign from above that I should not go out to drinks on Friday with this new guy? I contemplate whilst burying myself in a massive workload, surfacing only for the occasional Haribo or KIND bar. $22.11 12 p.m. — A. feels sorry for me and brings me a bagel, which I scarf down while browsing Amazon. (Remember when I said I hadn't made any Random Amazon Purchases yet? Here's why I was afraid.) I buy fairy lights for my room, a star-shaped cake pan and pillows. I share an account with my mother, so I transfer her $33.53 to cover it. $33.53 4 p.m. — It's been a haze of work and snack food, and I finally leave the office and head across London for more tutoring, the volunteers meeting, and drinks. I teach math for an hour, and then our meeting begins. We discuss some of the regular kids' ongoing issues, what extra support is needed, etc. We are also losing a couple of volunteers so I offer to tutor two sessions on a Thursday instead of one. The leader looks at me like I'm a godsend, and I'm content with my hero status. I beg off drinks because I'm still not feeling great, and head home. Through some weird fluke, I'm not charged for my commute to or from the school I tutor in. 8 p.m. — I get home and pretty much collapse on a heap in bed. I call A. and discover I have no actual clients to meet in Birmingham tomorrow. Unless that changes, I'm not going to make the trek. The FWB calls to see if I'm around. I explain how I feel and beg off, but he shows up with lemons, ginger, and honey to make tea, and basically babies me until I fall asleep. Quite simply, he is the best. Daily Total: $55.64",4,227
"10:45 a.m. — Well that was a long sleep! I wake up with the FWB beside me and thank my lucky stars that he is around. I'm beginning to feel guilty about this date tonight though. FWB is beginning to feel a lot more like BF, and I feel like a conversation might be around the corner. I decide I'll wait for him to initiate though. FWB has the day off so we head over to our fave brunch place/old haunt and get waffles with as many toppings as humanly possible. I grab the bill since he's been paying for everything recently. $43.93 2:30 p.m. — We decide to make a day of it and head to a local market as we're both pretty much out of food. I buy broccoli, mushrooms, leeks, asparagus, squash, a swede, sweet potatoes avocados and garlic, as well as a freshly baked loaf of sourdough. He buys pretty much the same, but they only accept cash so he pays. Next, we head to the local supermarket and I buy juice, sprite, pasta, halloumi, black beans, almond milk and canned tomatoes. He also picks up a basketful, and I cover the cost for the both of us. We head back to mine for a little Netflix and chill. $75.96 5:45 p.m. — I casually (I hope!) bring up my plans of going into London this evening for work drinks, and FWB insists I haven't crashed enough yet and suggests bailing. Though I find the suggestion sweet, I don't generally drink anyways so I know the night won't be too rough. We part ways and I jump on a train into central. Again, my card doesn't charge me for the travel and I feel super lucky right now. This may wind up being a cheaper night than I assumed! 5:57 p.m. — I spoke too soon on the cheap evening front. The Bestie texts me to remind me to buy Trevor Noah tickets for his show at the O2 in six months, and I head over to the Amazon Tickets website because I have a voucher. All the good seats have sold out and the only ones left are SUPER high and far back. On the plus side, they're cheap! It comes to $80.07 but the voucher knocks a fair bit off. $46.57 7:15 p.m. — Well that was awkward. Cute New Prospective Client brings one of his investors, L., and L. brings a date. L. gets really drunk and keeps making super inappropriate jokes about where the evening is going to go. Even his date is embarrassed, as is the Cute Guy. I drink a lemonade, but I'm really not feeling tonight and bow out after a little shop talk. Cute Guy says he will grab the tab we've opened on his way out, but I pay anyway and put it on the company card. ($44.57) 10:15 p.m. — Still trying to get out of London but trains are a nightmare. I'm starving — and take it from a London girl — Nando's is the only place worth heading for a mammoth pile of junk food. I get a chicken burger, spicy rice and garlic bread to-go, and eat it cross-legged in the middle of an aisle on a packed train. I try not to count all the people judging me right now, but it's hard. The FWB texts and asks how the night has gone. Um, not good? He's near the train station anyway, and swings by to pick me up and take me home. $16.89 Daily Total: $183.35",5,227
"8:30 a.m. — Wake up for the third morning this week with the FWB by my side. Life could be worse. Mindful of all he's been doing lately, I get out of bed and leg it down to the bakery around the corner, and he wakes up to fresh croissants and coffee. He's in the mood for a long, lazy lie in. I'm not opposed, but I have a bunch of work to catch up on from yesterday, so I bring my laptop into bed. $2.65 11:45 a.m. — I have plans for the afternoon so I ditch the laptop and put some actual clothes on. I leave the FWB in bed and head into London. Obviously, the day needs more coffee than my place can supply, so I stop at Starbucks. ($4.82) The transport gods are not on my side today, and I get charged for my travel. ($8.31) $13.13 3:45 p.m. — The program I tutor for during the week is having a career fair at a large secondary school today, and so I'm speaking for half an hour about the joys of working ""with people"" to around 500 teenagers. I'm not really an extrovert so this takes a lot coming from me. I think it came off well, but I'm exhausted from the second I step off the stage. I thank the organizer — it is truly a great event — and head home. I can't resist stopping to pick up my mum's Christmas present from the White Company: a giant, shaggy grey throw. They have 40% off for Black Friday (seriously, stop saying every day is Friday) so I only part with $87.07. Return rail fare is $8.31. $95.38 5:30 p.m. — I get back to my place and the FWB suggests we head to his place to cook dinner, which I am totally up for. FWB lives with his parents but they are away a lot. Their house is AMAZING though! My sister texts during the drive to ask if I need anything, which is code for ""I'm broke."" I'm in a particularly lazy and selfish mood and suggest she tidies my apartment and does laundry while I'm out. She agrees, and I transfer her some cash. $26.80 7:30 p.m. — Dinner was amazing; FWB sure can cook! We eat asparagus, chicken, salad, and chocolate fondue with strawberries AND marshmallows. I feel like a kid again. FWB also brings up the exclusivity/dating aspect during dinner, and suggests we do a trial basis of dating, which I'm totally up for, as the main reason I didn't want to dive into this in the first place was the fact I could quite easily screw it up! We tidy up a little, shower, and I head to bed with my BOYFRIEND. Hell yeah. Look at me adulting all over the place. Daily Total: $137.96",6,227
"8:30 a.m. — Wake up next to the BF (!!!!) and wonder what that crazy ringing is. Oh, right. Phone. I find it just as it goes to voicemail and realize I have about 30 missed calls from A. and H. I call H. back and conference in A. Turns out one of our biggest clients is having a mini-meltdown and everyone is heading into London now. I remember the downside to owning a startup, and try not to wake up the BF while desperately hunting down clothes. I find a pair of my jeans in the wardrobe, tuck one of the BF's white shirts into it, and pull on my converse of last night. Look in the mirror. Well, it will have to do. Kiss the BF goodbye and head out of the door. Ticket barriers are down on a Sunday mornings into London so travel = nada. Plus, no time for coffee. Look at me, winning at the whole not spending money thing. 10:15 a.m. — The client, A., H., and I all meet in a Pret. I'm the last to arrive (imagine that!) but A. has already brought me a chai, a muffin, and dried mango. I realize I would probably die if it weren't for her. It takes a few hours of reading policies, chatting with the client's other staff members over the phone, and generally calming everyone down, but eventually we get everything sorted. The client jokes we should bill her more because we had to come in on a Sunday, and we all give each other looks. I leave and find the BF waiting outside the Pret to surprise me. (Due to the Find My Friends app; he's not a stalker.) Did I mention yet he is the best? 2:30 p.m. — Lunch is fried halloumi sticks from Winter Wonderland (London's overhyped Christmas market) and churros. Both are cash only and the BF covers it. I pay the entrance and boot costs for the cutesy ice rink, and we spend 45 minutes wowing random strangers, because why not? $29.46 5:30 p.m. — We make it back to my place and roast ALL the veg we brought last week to make up for the terrible eating habits we have had all week. After its done, we divide it amongst all the Tupperware with rice, pasta, and CHEESE. Kabam, all ready to go. We watch Netflix and I try to get a bit of work and tutor prep done before crashing into bed. Daily Total: $29.46",7,227
"7:45 a.m. — I get out of bed and I hear the kitty scrambling around. I'm at a sublease for the month and they have the cutest little kitty. I got aggressively mugged a few days ago and a lot of my things were stolen, so I have been feeling extremely anxious and paranoid. (Disclaimer: This is going to be an unusual week for me.) Mitz, the kitty, has been a little fur ball of comfort. BUT, it's the holidays, so it's my favorite time of year! I decide to wear my new bright red boots as a pick-me-up. Can't let anything bring my holiday cheer down! 9 a.m. — I get to work and decide to buy a bagel at the café we have. I've had no appetite the past few days because of anxiety, but I'm on a mission to get back on track with my meals. I get a plain bagel with cream cheese and then make blueberry green tea that I had at my desk. $1.63 9:30 a.m. — I'm organizing Secret Santa amongst my friends and it's so fun! I always end up being the planner for activities, and since all of my friends also work in the advertising industry, we like to jokingly talk in email talk in our chats. 1o:35 a.m. — It's a bit slow this morning, so I go to a comfy corner at work to read articles and call my dad. He's going to visit family in El Salvador after a few years of not visiting, and I Venmo him money. My family is very low-income, and although I'm still not earning a ton, I'm trying to help out my parents as much as I can — even if it's something small. Plus, he will also be giving money to some of our family members who live in poor conditions over there, so I'm happy I can finally help out. $50 12 p.m. — We get out of a creative review with the account team and have to re-do a lot of things. Ugh; the life of a copywriter. 12:30 p.m. — I haven't bought groceries this week so I have to go out and buy lunch. I get a few rosemary potatoes and chicken. My coworker and I also decide to split a container of peppermint hot chocolate that will last us for a while. $8 1:45 p.m. — I've had to replace some of my stolen things one by one, and next on the list is a new water bottle. I find a cute one on Amazon and it's pretty cheap compared to the S'well bottle I had before. I'm trying to look at the situation in a positive way. At least I get a fresh start! $13 2 p.m. — Secret Santa exchanges are this Sunday and I have no idea what to get my person! I browse the internet but give up and get back to work. 6 p.m. — I finally get home. I was on a workout and semi-marathon training roll these past couple of weeks, but I haven't been very active the last few days. I decide to do a 45-minute, at-home workout because I don't want to lose the progress I had been making and I can't let my anxiety prevent me from working out. Plus, working out always makes me happy. Blogilates on YouTube is always my favorite! 8 p.m. — I eat rice pudding and my roommates give me a glass of white wine; they're so sweet. I work on my freelance work and then watch a few holiday vlogs on YouTube. Why do I get so much satisfaction from watching rich girls who live in L.A.? I'll never understand but I'm not complaining. Daily Total: $72.63",1,228
"9:30 a.m. — I eat oatmeal topped with honey and granola for breakfast! It's Hump Day and it's comforting to know I'm almost halfway done with the week. 2 p.m. — It's actually been a busy day today. My coworker and I have had back-to-back meetings and finally have time to go buy lunch before our next meeting. I'm craving breakfast for lunch, so I get an egg, bacon, and cheese sandwich with ketchup. I use a 10% coupon. I love eggs! $4 9 p.m. — Finally getting off work. I don't work late nights very often, but today was an exception. Ever since the mugging, I've been a little uneasy about going home late at night if it's past 7 p.m. My job expenses transportation if we work late anyways, so I get an Uber. ($28 expensed) 10 p.m. — As soon as the ride is done and I get inside my apartment, I break down crying unexpectedly. My Uber driver reminded me a bit of my attacker; he was wearing his earphones and not paying attention to the road so I started feeling uneasy and all these emotions came flowing out. Sometimes you just need a good cry to let out other emotions you've been trying to suppress all week. I feel a little bit better. I also send a very strongly worded message to Uber. 11:30 p.m. — After a short home HIIT workout, a 10-minute meditation session, and cuddling with Mitz, I feel good and decide to go to sleep. Daily Total: $4",2,228
"8 a.m. — It's Friday Eve, as one of my coworkers likes to say! It makes Thursdays sound so good. I head out to the door and finally remember to leave my chicken defrosting. I NEED to get back into my cooking routine. I hate when you're doing well but then you have an off week! But it happens to everyone, so whatever. 9 a.m. — I get another mini-bagel with cream cheese. I can't help it! I think it's hilarious how much I love bagels and cream cheese and I've only been in New York for six months. I used to HATE cream cheese. $1.63 1:30 p.m. — Another busy day ahead of us! Lots of writing and brainstorming to do. My coworker and I finally have a breather and get Chipotle for lunch. I haven't had Chipotle in a few months and I had been craving it. Plus, I can save the other half for dinner. $9 3 p.m. — Champagne and cake for a coworker's goodbye. I'm full but still can't resist cake. 8 p.m. — Leaving work! It's not awfully late yet and I decide to take the train back. I get home safely and notice that I felt a little less paranoid. Baby steps! 9:15 p.m. — I cook my chicken for tomorrow's lunch while I eat my Chipotle leftovers and watch Vlogmas videos on YouTube. I use my dad's favorite recipe and miss my family. I can't wait to go back to Texas for the holidays! 11 p.m. — I've been trying a new shampoo for curly hair that has been making my hair so soft and less frizzy. I head to bed smelling like coconut. I  jump into bed, enjoying the feeling of being clean and moisturized. Daily Total: $10.63",3,228
"7:40 a.m. — It's Friday! I put on clothes and get ready to leave for work. I love smelling all of the Christmas trees for sale on the street in the morning. 9:30 a.m. — Cereal for breakfast and blueberry green tea (my current obsession). Today is going to be a super chill day at work, thank goodness. I decide to go apartment hunting. My best friend might be moving in January and it's also time for me to finally settle into a lease anyways since I've been subleasing around for four months now. I finally have money saved up for an apartment deposit so I'm ready; my goal is January! 12:30 p.m. — Chicken for lunch. Everyone seems to be in a Friday mood, so I just do online shopping and make tweaks on a writing assignment. My coworker and I also go to the Amazon Book Store and I buy . It has amazing reviews and I can't wait to start reading. The cashier convinces me to add on a holiday book that will be donated to children in hospitals ($3). Kids are my weak spot, especially since I have a seven-year-old sister. $14 7 p.m. — I have to replace my MacBook (another thing that got stolen) so I go check out the laptops. My friends raised money to help me get a new laptop, and friend-of-a-friend is also letting me use her family and friends discount. I am so grateful for the people in my life. I make my decision after talking to some of the employees, who are so nice! I used to work retail during my college years to completely financially support myself and I low-key miss customer service. Going to officially order the laptop in a few days! 7:30 p.m. — It's snowing tomorrow and I am not ready. I go to Uniqlo and pick up HEATTECH clothing. A lot of it is on promotion, so I get one black crew neck ($10), black leggings ($10), a turtleneck ($10) and socks ($6.99). I also see a cute velvet dress that I can't resist getting ($19.99). I don't buy a lot of clothes but I decide to treat myself. Plus, clothes for the weather are a necessity. $57.50 9 p.m. — It's a chill night today. I make tea and toast whole wheat bread and top it with honey. I turn on my YouTube vlogs and play Christmas music in the background. Daily Total: $71.50",4,228
"7:30 a.m. — My internal body clock wakes me up even on weekends, but I force myself to go back to sleep. 10:30 a.m. — It's snowing! I'm a Texas native and the most snow I've seen is maybe two inches. It looks absolutely beautiful. I look out the window, boil water for my tea, and make two eggs over toast for breakfast. I pour ketchup on the side. My roommates are starting so I watch an episode with them. 12 p.m. — I've got a lot of holiday shopping to do this weekend. I get on the train to go into the city. My first stop is Union Square Holiday Market. 1:30 p.m. — I ended up getting a colorful wrist wallet for my mom. She loves bright colors and I found a perfect striped one. This is the first year I can actually afford to get my family and friends real gifts, and that makes me so happy. The snow is falling, the vendors are all happy, people are bundled up in their coats, and I smell hot chocolate. It is such a beautiful Saturday! $30 2:45 p.m. — I meet up with a friend and her boyfriend at my next stop, the Bryant Park Holiday Market. I need to find something for my Secret Santa today since the gift exchange is tomorrow! She recently moved into her new apartment, so I decide to get home decor. I find a beautiful Italian ceramics vendor and buy a little blue and white bowl. We walk around more, watch people ice skating, and look up at the huge tree. Sometimes I can't believe I'm really in NYC under the snowfall experiencing my first real winter! The holidays make me emotional. $12 3 p.m. — I've never been to the Chick-Fil-A in New York so we decide to go there since I am craving it so much. The line is long and filled with drunk people participating in SantaCon but we get our food fast. I order a chicken sandwich meal with lemonade. I am so mad at how expensive this meal is; it's double the Texas prices. Definitely will not be coming here often. $10 5:30 p.m. — I'm getting an eye exam today — a long overdue visit. I haven't gotten a new pair of glasses in three years and my best friend works at Warby Parker, so his discount is super nice. I get an eye exam ($75), which should be reimbursed as soon as I call my mom to get insurance details and the pair of glasses I choose is only $87 after his family and friends discount. They're so cute and I can't wait for them to ship. I love a good pair of statement glasses. Merry Christmas to me! $162 7:30 p.m. — Today is a coworker's holiday party! I head back home and watch a little YouTube. My friend is coming over with a bottle of wine before we head to the party. 10:30 p.m. — My friend and I check out a bar near my apartment that has cocktails on tap. I get an amazing lime drink. I haven't bought a drink in ages (I try not to spend much money on alcohol), so this is a nice treat. $10 11 p.m. — We make it to the party. Very tipsy. Let's see how the night goes! Daily Total: $224",5,228
"9 a.m. — Well, last night was fun! Recap: My friends joined me at my coworker's party, then we drunkenly had snowball fights at the park on our way to a dance bar, then we danced a lot, left and had more snowball fights, ended up at Popeyes, and everyone crashed at my place. It's been a long time since I had one of these nights and playing in the snow was one of the purest and most carefree times I've had in awhile. But I have an awful headache. Ugh. This is why I don't drink a lot very often. 10 a.m. — We decide to check out a cute little diner right by my apartment, and it's so cheap I'm in shock. Two eggs, hash browns, toast, home fries, bacon, and OJ for only $5.50! It's so inexpensive that we decide to split two waffles among the four of. us. We order the fresh fruit waffle, which comes with the strangest selection of fruits. Watermelon on my waffle? In this economy? Super weird but the waffle itself tastes good. We make a mental note to never order that again — but I'm still coming back. $10 2 p.m. — After breakfast, my friends leave and I crawl back into bed and slept for another three hours. My headache is, sadly, still not gone. My coworker's birthday brunch is in an hour so I head to the East Village. 5:30 p.m. — Leaving his birthday brunch which really ended up being just an early dinner. I wasn't hungry so I ended up just getting an order of fries. $9 6:30 p.m. — I need to get a gift bag and another little thing for my Secret Santa gift, so I go back to the Union Square Holiday Market. I feel like I've spent my entire weekend here. I get a little set of different scented tea candles ($12), a white gift bag ($3), white tissue paper ($2), and a little white bow ($2). $19 8:30 p.m. — Secret Santa time! is playing in the background and one friend brings two boxes of pizza; the host has hot chocolate for us. My person ends up loving her Secret Santa gift! My Secret Santa gets me a candle called City Scapes: Central and it smells like oakwood and ginger; it's beautiful. He also gives me a little pin that I love. 11 p.m. — We finally leave and my friend lets me sleep over at her place today since it's getting late. Daily Total: $38",6,228
"9 a.m. — Trains are messed up because of an explosion at the train station. So terrifying, but I make it to work on time and I'm glad no one got hurt. It's Bagel Monday so I have a plain bagel with cream cheese and my usual blueberry green tea. 12:30 p.m. — For lunch, I go get tomato soup with a free coupon I have. Today's a slightly chill day with just a few meetings and brainstorming my art director and I have to do for some social media posts. The office seems dead today! A lot of people are already gone for the holidays. 1 p.m. — Small Tinder/Bumble break. I haven't been on a date in so long, especially since I've been so jittery lately but I do really want to start dating. I'm a romantic at heart, so ideally, I'd love to just fall in love with someone randomly at like a bookstore and we lock eyes and live happily ever after. But it's 2017, everyone is “finding themselves”, I'm super busy, they're super busy, and dating is just hard. But may as well make an effort and set aside time for dates. I swipe for a few minutes and immediately am over it. I'll just be single forever! I'll try again later. 6 p.m. — I leave work and head to the Apple store. I'm picking up my new laptop today! I literally couldn't have done this without the help of my friends and friends of friends. The pick-up line is hectic but it moves fast. I take an Uber home because I don't want to be carrying around a huge Apple bag with a spanking new laptop inside. I have a free ride because of my complaint to Uber of the sketchy driver last time, so this won't cost me anything. 8 p.m. — Ahh, the new keyboard feels so nice! I set up the laptop and read for a bit. For dinner, I make eggs and black beans. Eggs for dinner are the best. Then, I eat raspberries and blueberries for dessert. I do a bit of online shopping and see an art print that my brother would love so I have to get it. I still have so many other gifts to buy. $13 9 p.m. — Short at-home butt and abs workout. I really need to get back to the gym soon. It's been over a week since I've gone, but it's the holidays and I'm going back home for two weeks soon anyways. My mom will be feeding me nonstop, so maybe I can start in 2018? Daily Total: $13",7,228
"6:30 a.m. — Struggle to wake up, like most mornings. I start my usual morning routine: wash my face, skincare, and take care of the dogs and cat while my moisturizer sinks in. I'm a skincare freak. Plus, for the amount I spend on my La Mer cream I want to give it every opportunity to succeed. I start in on my makeup routine, halfway through my process I hear a crash in the kitchen. I run in there to find that the cat has knocked over my crystal vase of flowers, all over my clean kitchen floor; thankfully the vase didn't break. I clean up the water with and vow to re-mop the floor when I get home tonight. Out the door only 15 minutes late, I grab a drive-through sandwich on the way to work from Chick-Fil-A and eat it as I drive. My boss is already at the office when I get in, which is out of the ordinary but she is super chill so I start my day. $6.27 10 a.m. — Get a call from my car dealership valet, who is out front with my car. I go outside and it is way chilly in the not-so-winter dress I decided to wear. Everything looks fine, so we exchange cars and he is off. I will admit I probably pay too much for my car, but it is a luxury car and they have so many perks, like valet service whenever I need something. This time it was only an inspection, which cost me, but usually, everything is covered. $25.50 11:30 a.m. — I get a text from my dealership service manager saying I left my garage door opener in the loaner car. He offers to mail it to me but I have such a busy weekend, I opt to just go get it. Since it is around the time I leave for lunch normally and the dealership is only 15 minutes away, I get going. As I'm driving down the road I notice a weird rattling sound. It wasn't there before, so I turn my music down to keep listening as I drive. I only notice the sound when I accelerate from a stop. I get to the dealership and get my garage door opener, let my service manager know about the sound, and we drive around the block so he can hear it for himself. He agrees that it is not normal, so I swap cars again for a loaner and go back to my office. 2 p.m. — Back at my office and starting to get hungry from my no-lunch adventure, I check my drawer and find a KIND bar I stashed away. I munch on that as I work on finishing a bunch of projects. I am taking a vacation day tomorrow and need to get shit done! 4:45 p.m. — My service manager lets me know my car is ready; it turns out someone didn't snap some clip under my hood, he is super apologetic and offers to bring my car in the morning. I decline since I won't be at my office tomorrow and my house is a good 25 miles or more from the dealership. I mentally prepare myself for traffic and leave a bit early. Forty-five minutes later, I am back at the dealership and back in my car. I can now start going home. My BFF texts me and lets me know she is only about two hours from my house, which make me super happy since I haven't seen her since we went to Paris in May. I call my hubby on my way home, stuck in traffic yet again. We chat about my car and his day and what my BFFs and I have planned for the weekend. 6:45 p.m. — Finally almost home. I call hubby again and ask him if he wants me to grab dinner since I am way too tired to cook tonight, plus the BFF should be here in about an hour. We decide on Chick-Fil-A and even though I already had that for breakfast, I am so tired and hungry at this point that I don't care. I swing by the drive-through to get us sandwiches. I let hubby pay for this one using the credit card I have, and finally get home and eat dinner. Once we are finished I do some last-minute straightening and mopping of the kitchen from the morning accident and wait for the BFF to arrive. 8:15 a.m. — She's here! Once she gets settled we all sit in the living room catching up. I'm so glad my BFF and husband get along and can do things like this, and I don't have to feel like I have to choose who to spend time with. We decide to put on a movie and drink some cocktails. I make them whiskey and Cokes and open a bottle of Moët for myself. I know it sounds so bourgie, but I have been on a serious Moët kick for the past few months (which is weird because I usually only drink whiskey). We finish the bottle and the movie; it's about 1 a.m. at this point so we call it a night. Poor hubby has to work in the morning. Daily Total: $31.77",1,229
"7:30 a.m. — Hubby is being so damn loud getting ready for work I have no choice but to be awake this early. I decide to not fight it and get up and take care of the dogs and cat. BFF is awake too by this point; we chat a little and decide what to do for the day. Shopping, mani-pedis, and drinks are the game plan. We go our separate ways and get ready for the day, then make our way to the mall. 10:30 a.m. — FOOD is all we can think about! We walk the mall until we get to a cute little brunch café, but they have a weird note in the window saying they are closed all day and maybe tomorrow. Back on the move, we decide to go to the other side of the mall to La Madeleine. We order a salad and half sandwich each — not the brunch we hoped for but we are so hungry we don't even care. $9.94 11 a.m. — Now we are ready to shop! We hit Anthropologie since it is closest. We see a sign that all home stuff is on sale and proceed to smell every candle in the place. I decide on my favorite, ""Volcano,"" and check out. She buys a cute ring tray and candle. We walk around the mall stopping and looking in stores and end up at Sephora. Sephora is having a sale and I have a list of things I want. We go through the entire store grabbing what we want. I grab a Natasha Denona pallet that I have been eyeing but couldn't justify paying full price for, primer, hair oil, a clay mask, and a bronzer kit. We pay and go to Lush so my BFF can grab some things. I decide to get stocking stuffers for my sister since we are there: bath bombs are some of her favorite things. Next is Aerie for undies; they are having a sale too, so I buy a few pairs. BFF gets some too, and with sore feet, we head to our next adventure. $451.74 3 p.m. — We drive next to the nail salon, basically a tradition for us. My dip is still looking fresh so I opt for a nice pedicure; BFF gets a mani and a pedi. Mine is a six-step pearl pedi that smells amazing! However, the old man next to me literally won't stop farting, and it's seriously so nasty! The BFF and I catch up on her boyfriend, life, and everything else that has happened in the six months since we saw each other last. $70 4 p.m. — By the time we are done at the nail salon we realize we are hungry again. We walk to a taco shop that is having happy hour. The place is totally empty and only one lady is working aside from the kitchen staff. We sit at the bar and it takes a while for her to get to us, but when she finally does I get a skinny margarita and chicken taco; BFF gets a house margarita and a taco, and we order chips to split. We sit and talk for a while, long enough for her to order another marg and me another taco. I don't know what it is, but I am starving! Hubby calls and says he is leaving work early so we agree to meet him back at home soon. $18.14 6 p.m. — We get home and hubby has already eaten leftovers for dinner. BFF and I don't want food so we decide to see what's on Netflix and relax. (We share an account with my parents and don't pay anything for it.) We put on , which is surprisingly funny, make some drinks, and partially through the movie, Hubby and BFF decide to raid the fridge and pantry and share cheese and Oreos. I'm still so full from tacos so I pass. 11:45 p.m. — I'm falling asleep on the sofa as we all watch episodes of . I decide to go to bed and Hubby and BFF stay up talking. I pass out to the soothing sounds of waves from my sleep songs app. Daily Total: $549.82",2,229
"7:45 a.m. — SO TIRED! But we're going to our college's football game and it's basically the whole reason my BFF is in town. We have a tradition in which we always go to this particular game together. We both rush to get ready and pack up the car with tailgate essentials. On the way to the stadium, we stop at Chick-Fil-A for a quick breakfast. $4.97 9:30 a.m. — We arrive at the stadium, find our tailgating spot, set up our chairs, and pop a bottle of Moët for mimosas. It is pretty cold out, so we just sit and talk and drink. Once it gets closer to game time, we decide to find our seats. The game is going great, we score in the first 15 seconds of the game; by halftime, we're still winning. We decide to beat the halftime concession stand rush and split a few minutes early. Pizza is calling our names. It's highway robbery, how much you have to pay for food at sporting events, but what are you gonna do? $17 3 p.m. — We go home after the game is over. Hubby is working on a project for work and BFF and I sit around talking. Hubby joins us and asks what our plans are for the night. Apparently, when we were drunk-watching last night, we decided that going to a strip club would be a good idea. Since my brother-in-law is now old enough to go to one, I had the bright idea of saying we should take him. We do some research to decide on a place and make plans. BFF and I change outfits and I throw on a more daring lipstick for the night. 7:30 p.m. — We go out for hibachi (one of my favorites!) at dinnertime! Brother-in-law (BIL) is meeting us at dinner, so we sit at the bar and have drinks until he arrives. Since it is still happy hour, BFF and I get a martini each and hubby gets his usual. The bartender is cool and gives us alcohol-soaked gummy bears that are surprisingly good. We grab a table when BIL arrives I am due for another drink. I am totally feeling the first one, especially because of all the gummy bears I ate. Everyone orders food and more drinks, and we have a great time — and end up very full. Hubby pays the tab for all of us and we go back home so that BIL can drop off his car at our house before our adventure. 9:30 p.m. — We get to the strip club, and Hubby again pays for everyone. We go inside and a waitress leads us to a table and brings us some pitchers of Coke since it is BYOB and we have almost a full bottle of whiskey. Hubby gives us some singles and we enjoy the show. Since it is still somewhat early we are getting a lot of attention. BIL is in total shock since this is his first time. We get a couple of girls to come over to him and it is honestly the highlight of the night. We enjoy the drinks and the show when BIL notices a girl that is more his type. Hubby asks her to come over and pays for BIL to get two private dances; you can tell he is nervous but he follows her to the back room. The three of us proceed to watch some seriously talented girls: one is basically G.I. Jane and can climb that pole! BIL comes back and we keep at it; at this point the place is packed and we are all close to hitting our limit; plus, it is after 1 a.m. at this point. We pay our waitress and leave. 2 a.m. — There is a wreck on the way home so traffic is terrible and it takes us forever! Once we are back, BIL goes back home and the three of us talk about the night then go to bed. It has been such a long day for me and BFF. Daily Total: $21.97",3,229
"10 a.m. — We all finally wake up and chat a little about last night before going out to brunch to one of our favorite spots. I am super dehydrated from all the booze last night and order a Pellegrino; Hubby and BFF get mimosas. I want brunch food, but I opt for a chicken sandwich since I feel like I need protein and I don't care for eggs. BFF follows suit while Hubby gets a breakfast burrito. Brunch is so good, and exactly what I needed. I offer to pay since Hubby paid for everything last night. Our favorite waiter reminds us that we get $10 off for signing up for their points card. I end up giving him $10 tip just for that. $47.89 12:30 p.m. — It is time for BFF to leave. We help her load up her car and say our goodbyes. I'm sad to see her go, but happy for a little quiet time. Kitty is low on food and litter so I run down the road to the pet store. I get talked into buying a different food that is the same price, but half the size. I give it a try because I want my babies to be well taken care of. I grab some kitty litter and remember we are out of paper towels; I run into the store next door and get those. $37.87 1:30 p.m. — The rest of the day is about house chores: laundry, dishes, etc., followed by a two-hour nap. 6 p.m. — I don't feel so great after we wake up from our naps. The lack of sleep and alcohol are taking their toll on me. Hubby and I decide to snuggle on the sofa and watch TV. My stomach doesn't feel great, so I munch on a few things but don't have much of an appetite. I decide to call it a night early and go to bed. Daily Total: $85.76",4,229
"6:30 a.m. — Ugh, Monday already? I wake up and go through my typical routine, feeling like crap. I am either getting a cold or my allergies are bad today. I can't stop sneezing or blowing my nose. Normally I would take off work but I just had Friday off so I suck it up, take some meds, and get on my way. I drink a protein shake during the commute and decide to hide in my office until my first meeting. 10:30 a.m. — First two meetings are out of the way, but I feel even worse. I answer some emails and attempt to work on projects but I am just not into it. I'm starting to get hungry so I search my office fridge and grab a cheese and pretzel pack, which turns out to be very good. I make a mental note to buy more of these next time I am at the store. 2 p.m. — I take a call with my boss and finish up work. My dad texts asking to meet for dinner; my sister broke her phone and they want to borrow an old iPhone I have. We make plans to meet at an Indian restaurant on our side of town. I shoot my mom and mother-in-law and email about the upcoming Thanksgiving holiday, explaining what dishes everyone should bring. 5:45 p.m. — I get home and usher Hubby into the shower. He is all sweaty from a run, and we have to meet my parents soon. Once he is ready and we go to dinner, my dad and sister are stuck in traffic. Hubby, mom, and I order apps and wait for them, chatting about the upcoming holiday. My dad and sister finally arrive and we order family style, digging in as soon as the food hits our table. We catch up on all the drama with my sister and her roommate and what everyone has been up to. My dad treats us to dinner. I give my sister the phone and we part ways. 8:30 p.m. — Once Hubby and I get home we chat a bit and I go to bed, I am still feeling sick and just tired in general. Daily Total: $0",5,229
"6:30 a.m. — I didn't get as much sleep as I hoped for last night. I was wide awake at 1:30 a.m. with a very runny nose, and I tossed and turned for the remainder of the night, meaning waking up was extra hard today. I struggle through my morning routine and leave for work with a protein shake in hand. I am almost out of gas and decide to stop on my way. It is freezing out while I wait for my gas, which seems to be taking longer than usual. $35.22 9 a.m. — Once I get to the office I check my monthly budget and pay some bills. My credit card payment and furniture payment are due in a few days so I pay $500 and $150; that's more than the minimum, but I have a goal to get pay them off in the next six months. I browse online trying to figure out Christmas ideas for everyone. I load up a few carts but don't purchase anything just yet. Then it's time to be productive and start to do actual work. $650 12 p.m. — I grab a sandwich down the street from my office, and eat it at my desk. I can successfully avoid everyone at the office until after lunch; it's the one perk of working in such a small office. I prep for a few big meetings I have this week for most of the day. After, I break for a quick meeting with my boss, followed by an extremely uncomfortable meeting with our creative team. They totally bombed on a project — like, didn't remotely do what was asked — and my boss is pissed. We chat for a few minutes before I go back to my office. I can hear her and our lead designer yelling and I attempt to eavesdrop, but I can't hear much. I decide to finish my project and mind my own business for the rest of the day. $8.87 5:15 p.m. — Leave a little later than usual after I find a good stopping point. I call Hubby on the way home and we chat about the day and try to figure out what to do for dinner. Traffic is extra terrible today. I get home a little after 6 and immediately start cooking dinner. I'm hungry and tired, and the last thing I want to do is drag out the dinner process. I make burrito bowls with rice, beans, corn, chicken, cheese, and salsa — basically an at-home version of Chipotle. They turn out better than usual! We eat on the sofa and watch . 7:30 p.m. — When we finish eating I clean up the kitchen and Hubby does the dishes. I watch YouTube videos until he is done, then we watch more TV and talk about the week so far and our Thanksgiving plans. Around 9:30, I decide to hit the hay, only to browse some more on my phone until I can barely keep my eyes open. Daily Total: $694.09",6,229
"6:30 a.m. — Wake up and do the usual routine. I decide that the expensive eyeshadow pallet I bought over the weekend is going back. I don't like the colors and it makes my eyes itch. I remind myself to do some online shopping when I get to work since today is the last day of the Sephora sale. I leave for work with my protein shake. 9 a.m. — No one is really at work yet, so I hide in my office and surf the Sephora site. I end up rationalizing a few more purchases since they are 20% off and I need to buy gifts for Christmas. (I am attempting to get all my Christmas shopping done early this year.) I buy concealer, a skincare set, eyelashes, and setting spray for me; and perfume for mom and sister, plus cologne for Hubby. $256.33 12:30 p.m. — Just finished a meeting with a vendor and my boss, and I run out to a local Chinese place for lunch. I hate where my office is because there is a small selection of food; usually this makes me bring my lunch, but no such luck this week. Hubby and I text while I eat my orange chicken. $9.74 1:30 p.m. — While texting my husband, the topic of Christmas gifts come up and somehow the subject turns to cologne. He informs me that he no longer likes the cologne which, unbeknownst to him, I just purchased. I hit the Sephora site again and buy the one he likes; looks like I have two returns to make now. I check my bank account and see that an order I placed last month finally got billed; I totally forgot about that purchase. $126.02 3 p.m. — My meetings are done for the day; all I need to do is finish one project for a meeting tomorrow and I am good! My boss usually leaves early on Wednesdays so I sneak out a little early too. I get home with slightly less traffic than usual and try to figure out what to make for dinner. Hubby opts for leftover burrito bowls and I heat up soup. The only thing I like about winter is the weather being chilly enough for soup. Other than that, I HATE the cold! 9 p.m. — Soup is starting to wear off so I munch on Goldfish while we watch a little TV and unwind from the day. Hubby is working on his side project and I'm starting to fall asleep. I decide to call it a night. Daily Total: $392.09",7,229
"9:30 a.m. — I slept in this morning and it feels amazing. Slowly meander downstairs and make myself a latte with almond milk and my breakfast staple: oatmeal with peanut butter, bananas, and pomegranate seeds. It's so good! One of my roommates is also up and we start an episode of . We started watching last week and can't stop. It's a great crime thriller that is full of twists and turns. 12 p.m. — Having a lazy day and the roommate and I decide to do a puzzle. We venture out to Target and pick up a Christmas-themed, 1,000-piece puzzle. She buys and I'll Venmo her for half, or pick up the next puzzle. (Minnesota winters tend to cause a lot of shut-in weekend days.) I pick up popcorn kernels because we're out and we make popcorn all the time. When I get home, I reheat the lentil soup I've been eating all week. $3.29 3 p.m. — Finished a few more episodes of and we've completed the outer edge of the puzzle. My other roommate is home after a night out and he joins. 7 p.m. — We're going out with a few friends tonight and we stop by a local grocery store to pick up frozen pizzas and beer. I buy the pizzas and my roommate buys the beer. $10 7:30 p.m. — We watch the Badgers vs. Ohio State game at my friend's house while we get ready to go out. This is one of my favorite groups to get together with, and it's always a guaranteed good time. We sneak in a couple of whiskey shots. 10:30 p.m. — We head out to a dive karaoke bar in our neighborhood. We've been regulars here for the past five years and it's one of the best spots in NE. It's packed so we can't find a table and opt for the bar instead. We order a round of drinks and a round of “Vegas Bomb” shots and we all toss in cash to cover. It looks like it's going to be an hour and a half wait to get in for karaoke so we decide to move on. $20 11:15 p.m. — We head to another great dive bar that's only a few blocks away. We split a few more pitchers of beer and nachos. My roommate throws the drinks and food on her card — she'll send out a Venmo for my portion later. We finish the night at a fun dance spot down the block. They're playing a fun mix of 90s/early 2000s pop which is the best to dance to. I cover the Lyft home. $6.97 Daily Total: $40.26",1,230
"9 a.m. — Definitely feeling the effects of last night, I crawl out of bed and make myself a latte. We watch last night's episode of and agree that the night got a little out of hand. I put an egg on top of an English muffin with a little avocado — just what my hangover needs. 12 p.m. — More episodes of and the puzzle. I don't have a lot of grad school homework this weekend so I'm okay with taking it easy. Next weekend, I have a huge project due so I won't have much downtime. I heat up leftover rice pilaf I have in the fridge from last week. 5 p.m. — We finished the puzzle and ; I'd consider that a productive day. It's a “use up what's in the fridge” kind of day, so I make myself an egg salad using the last of my groceries. My roommate Venmos me for my portion of last night's drinks and food. $24.88 8:30 p.m. — I finish up some homework that I've been putting off all weekend. I'm getting my MA online part-time to become a school counselor and it usually involves a lot of online discussions. I crawl into bed early and fall asleep faster than normal probably thanks to the late night last night. Daily Total: $24.88",2,230
"7 a.m. — It's a struggle to get up this morning, especially with the dreary day outside. It's been unseasonably warm and it's supposed to rain today, which is unheard of for December in Minnesota. I make myself a latte to try and wake up a bit. 8:10 a.m. — I head into work (a few minutes late) and respond to missed emails from the weekend while I eat my oatmeal. I usually keep breakfast ingredients in the fridge and at my desk so I always have food on hand for the morning. It's going to be a busy day; I have a full day of interviews with candidates scheduled. I like meeting with people and it helps the day go by faster. 9:30 a.m. — My roommate and I talk about going to tonight. We're big into Oscar season and try to see all of the movies that are getting Oscar buzz. It's showing at Uptown Theater and probably won't go to wide-release so I buy us two tickets ahead of time. $22 12 p.m. — Lunchtime! I usually eat with my team and we have a café in our building that does soups, salads, sandwiches etc. It's perfect for days like today where I'm running low on groceries. I end up ordering a grilled cheese sandwich and fruit. I tend to eat much healthier when I don't eat out, oh well. $5.57 4 p.m. — Head home for the day. I'm definitely glad the Monday workday is over. I do homework and reheat more lentil soup. I've been eating this for six days but I still have a lot left. Figuring out portions for one person can be a struggle sometimes. 7:15 p.m. — Head to the movie with my roommate and I buy us popcorn to share. This is one of my favorite theaters to see movies at and this movie does not disappoint! James Franco gives quite the performance and we're laughing out loud for the entire movie. Highly recommend! $7 10:30 p.m. — Home and in bed. I fall asleep to an episode of , my guilty pleasure. I think they're pretty funny. Daily Total: $34.57",3,230
"6:45 a.m. — I wake up today to a handful of text messages from my coworkers and my boss. It rained and snowed all last night and the temps are now below freezing, so the roads will be pretty unsafe. Because of that, most people are working from home. I don't live far from the office so I decide to go in. 8:30 a.m. — It took me an additional 30 minutes to get to work (a lot for my short commute) and I'm one of the only people in the office. I actually have a lot to do and have a very productive morning because there is no one around to chat with or be distracted by. I'm not super hungry so I grab a few Wasa crackers I have in my desk and top them with avocado. 11:45 a.m. — I'm starving at this point and decide to order from Urban Sub because they deliver. I get my favorite vegetarian wrap, which is super delicious. I try to eat meat-free during the week unless I go out. I browse my favorite daily news sites while I eat and am thoroughly enjoying the office being so quiet. $10.16 2 p.m. — I decide to go home to avoid the evening traffic because the roads are still pretty bad. The ride home is treacherous and I'm glad to finish the day from the warmth of my living room. I got paid today, so I transfer $1,000 into my savings account. I get a commission check once a month and I've been putting it all away for when I'm a full-time intern next year. I'll be unemployed for the better part of a year, so I've been saving for a while now. 4 p.m. — My roommates are busy tonight, which is good because I have errands to run. I'm completely out of food and I'd usually go to Trader Joe's, but there isn't one near the other places I have to stop. I settle for Cub and get stuff for curry: chickpeas, zucchini, onion, sweet potatoes, garlic, coconut curry sauce and rice, as well as English muffins and avocados for breakfast. $32.13 4:30 p.m. — I head over to Target to grab Christmas candy, more Christmas lights, and some of my skincare and makeup necessities. Last stop is Home Depot to look at Christmas trees. We don't have room for a big one, and they don't have many real little ones, so I settle on a five-foot fake tree that's pretty cute. Checked a lot of my list tonight! $82.91 6:30 p.m. — I head home and make the curry; it's hearty, delicious and a nice break from the lentil soup. One of my roommates comes home and we spend time listening to Christmas tunes and decorating our townhouse. I love this time of year and how festive the weather makes it feel. 8:30 p.m. — We watch last night's episode of on Hulu and make popcorn. I crawl into bed around 10. Daily Total: $125.20",4,230
"8 a.m. — The roads are much better today. I'm less busy this morning at work. I start the day off with an English muffin topped with avocado and a cup of coffee. I'm a creature of habit and never really get sick of avocado toast or oatmeal. 11:30 a.m. — My company likes to be pretty festive around the holidays which is always fun. Today, over lunch, we watch in a conference room. I heat up leftover chickpea curry and snack on the popcorn and cookies that someone brought in for the movie. 4:30 p.m. — Head home and finish an assignment that is due today. Luckily, it's a lighter assignment and doesn't take much time at all. I usually have two, four-credit classes each quarter, but one of my classes ended after six weeks instead of 10. The lighter workload is just what I need closer to the holidays. 7:30 p.m. — My roommate volunteers at U.S. Bank Stadium during Vikings games and they're doing a volunteer holiday appreciation event tonight where he can invite a few guests. They're showing on the big screens and everyone sets up on blankets picnic style on the field. The vendors are selling select items for a reduced price, so I grab a hot dog and eat some of the complimentary popcorn and water. $1.50 10:30 p.m. — Go home and to bed. I haven't had a chance to visit U.S. Bank Stadium since it was built so it was fun to walk around and explore the stadium and toss around the football. Daily Total: $1.50",5,230
"6:30 a.m. — I get up to shower and find my roommate beat me to the bathroom. The only annoying thing about living with roommates is the timing of getting ready in the morning, and that I share my bathroom with a guy. Oh well. I make a latte in the meantime. 8 a.m. — I get into work and there is a hot chocolate bar set up in the break room. I help myself to a coffee/hot chocolate mixture and make an English muffin with almond butter. I have interviews until lunch so it will be a busy morning. 12 p.m. — For lunch, I heat up my leftover chickpea curry and eat in the café downstairs with my coworkers. I welcome the much-needed break. When I get back, I send out an email about supplies we need for our holiday volunteering event. We're donating necessity baskets to an organization that helps homeless youth and I'm glad to be leading the efforts. 5 p.m. — I run to grab happy hour with a couple of girlfriends. I normally wouldn't be out every night, especially considering my school workload, but it seems like everyone tries to catch up before the holidays and I try to make time for friends I haven't seen in a while. We go to a new spot, in my neighborhood which was converted from an old strip club. I have a signature rum cocktail and a glass of white wine. We split small plates of crispy rice, mango salad, and egg rolls. The food was really good and I can't wait to come back for dinner sometime. $26.88 7:30 p.m. — My roommate and I say our goodbyes and head to a friend's place for dinner. My friend and his girlfriend invited us over and we couldn't pass up the opportunity for someone to cook for us. I grab beers from our fridge for us to share. The couple lives in our neighborhood and we get together often. It's such a good time; they made us an amazing veggie curry with naan. 9:20 p.m. — Go home, glad to be climbing into bed. I feel a cold coming on and I probably need a decent night's sleep. Daily Total: $26.88",6,230
"6:40 a.m. — Unfortunately, I was right. I wake up congested and feeling a little off. I pop a DayQuil before I head to work and make sure to drink a ton of water. 8 a.m. — I stop by the convenience store downstairs to grab Emergen-C. It's more expensive than running to a drug store, but you pay for convenience. I buy three packets for the next few days to hopefully knock this cold out. $3.27 11:30 a.m. — Grabbing lunch today with an old coworker and a few of my current coworkers. I haven't seen her in a few months and it's nice to catch up. We go to Cooper's, which is close to my office and has great lunch specials. We split pub pretzels and spinach and artichoke dip, and each get a lunch special. Nice way to break up a Friday! $23.89 7 p.m. — My roommates and I have been planning to go bowling at one of our favorite spots for a while now. It's definitely not a family bowling kind of place, and the drinks are usually flowing. A few other friends meet us and we have dinner before we bowl. We grab a bunch of bar apps to share and I'm digging the cheese curds; we also split a few pitchers of beer. My friend grabs the bill — which he does not need to do! — so my roommates and I whisper and plan to cover bowling for everyone. 8:30 p.m. — We bowl two games and have a blast. We also finish off a few more pitchers of beer and a couple of shots that were initially intended for the losing teams, but we all partake. My roommates and I covered bowling and the group splits the drinks. $53.68 11 p.m. — We head over to another karaoke spot that's a lot of fun. I don't usually sing, but my friends are pretty entertaining to watch. I'm definitely enjoying tonight, although I'm sure I'll regret the drinks in the morning considering my oncoming cold. I'll be shut-in the rest of the weekend completing a final project so I don't mind having a little fun tonight! Daily Total: $80.84",7,230
"6:30 a.m. — I don't have time to eat breakfast at home, so I stop at Starbucks on my way to work for their sous vide egg bites and an extra-hot flat white. I use their app to pay and add a dollar to their tip jar. (I seriously hemorrhage so much money through their stupid app.) $11.83 1:30 p.m. — I thought I could give IF (intermittent fasting) a go, but it's 1:30 and I'm really grumpy. I get a sandwich and overpriced bottle of kombucha from the convenience store that is inside our office building. $13.66 4 p.m. — I drive an hour to far Southwest Denver for a session of neurofeedback, which I am doing as an adjunct to the weekly therapy I receive for gender dysphoria. It's a brain training regimen where you get monitors hooked up to your scalp and ears to measure your brain waves, and then you get auditory feedback to help your brain learn how to operate more calmly and with greater efficiency. Buying four sessions at once drops the price per session from $70 each to $65 each, so I buy a package. It has made a huge difference in reducing my anxiety around driving and helped boost my performance at work. $260 Daily Total: $285.49",1,231
"3:30 p.m. — My hair is getting shaggy AF, so I finally stop in to see my hairdresser. She is awesome and we spend some time chatting. I pick up a travel-sized container of Kevin Murphy Balancing Wash in addition to getting my hair cut. I had to reschedule this appointment four times due to other things coming up, so I give her an extra-good tip on top of the $65 cut. $93.25 Daily Total: $93.25",2,231
"4:30 a.m. — I wake up and my freaking menstrual cup is leaking. I have severe gender dysphoria around my monthly cycle as it is. I try to not think about it, get cleaned up, and order a new brand that a friend recommended called FemmyCycle. Hopefully, it will ship soon. Sheesh. $45.45 6:30 p.m. — My partner is cranky that I constantly steal his luxurious Wings + Horns cabin fleece robe, so when I see that their oxblood crimson color robe has gone on sale, I snap it up for him. Although the robe lists for $167 Canadian, after the exchange rate, I only pay $137.99, which is fantastic. $137.99 Daily Total: $183.44",3,231
"6:15 a.m. — My gas tank is hovering around half full. I still remember how hard it was to get gasoline after September 11, and for some reason I have a ton of anxiety around letting my tank fall below this level. I stop at the filling station on my way to work and get a half-tank of mid-grade. $19.54 7:45 p.m. — I need to stop by the grocery store to pick up a few items. What started out as picking up kitchen garbage bags turns into over $100 worth of various items. $118.54 8:30 p.m. — I have a terrible habit of using a nicotine vape pen. There's a limited-edition cucumber flavor of the mint pods I usually order, so I pick up a packet, more mint pods, and a spare USB charger for the pen itself. Sometimes I secretly vape in the bathroom at work if nobody else is in there. $55.52 Daily Total: $193.60",4,231
"5:15 a.m. — I get a publisher's notice for a new book about reducing one's risk for Alzheimer's in my email, and I read it before getting out of bed and into the shower. Even though my partner has about 500 books in our shared home library, I buy it anyway. I recently had my genome sequenced and found out that I am heterogeneous for the APOE4 ""Apolipoprotein E"" gene for Alzheimer's, and this book contains a doctor's regimen that promises to help reduce the risk. $9.68 12:36 p.m. — I check my online banking account and see that my subscription to Google Music has auto-debited from my checking account. I got a pair of noise-canceling Bose QC35 headphones from my partner for Christmas, which makes it possible for me to work in my ridiculously noisy office. I use Google Music to listen to binaural beats to help me focus and concentrate throughout the day. 4:33 p.m. — My car is dirty from the snow we had a few weeks ago, so I stop by the car wash on my way home from work. I've had my car for nearly two years but have never waxed it, so to assuage my guilt, I get the premium auto wash that supposedly includes a wax-like spray that is supposed to help protect the paint. $15 Daily Total: $24.68",5,231
"8:30 a.m. — Because of my gender dysphoria around my chest, I usually wear a binder, a compression garment that is designed to flatten and conceal breast tissue. I have dense fibrocystic tissue and a 36 DDD chest, so it's hard to conceal. The two binders I have been wearing don't seem to conceal as well any longer, so I buy two more during a boring meeting using my phone. They ship via Priority Mail, so hopefully, I won't have to wait too long for them to arrive. $73.25 2 p.m. — I meet one of my good friends for a late lunch at one of Denver's most-hyped restaurants, Linger, in LoHi, and overrated neighborhood in Northwest Denver. Linger used to be Olinger's Mortuary until it was converted into a restaurant. I hardly ever drink, but I'm a sucker for coconut and they have a gin fizz that's made with coconut milk, so I order one in addition to our meal. I get a Korean-style chicken bao bun and sweet potato fries, and my friend gets a vegetarian burger called the Impossible Burger that looks just like hamburger. We split the tab. $34.46 Daily Total: $107.71",6,231
"1:30 p.m. — I have been treated for moderate to severe depression for the past 16 years. Although I was off all medication for the past four years, I was having a lot of difficulty functioning when I started therapy last summer. This is my co-pay for a 90-day supply of Prozac, or at least until I meet my $1,500 deductible for our health plan. $87.76 Daily Total: $87.76",7,231
"8 a.m. — I set an alarm to wake up earlier than I need to because I have my first onsite interview today since becoming unemployed. The interview isn't until 1 p.m., but I have to drive to the Fremont BART station, sit through a 45-minute ride, then take a 15-minute Lyft to the Presidio for the interview. I am super anal and love to be extra-prepared and early. 8:30 a.m. — My mom has prepared meat-filled scallion pancakes and a small bowl of pho for me so I'm ready to tackle this interview. Thank goodness for moms. 9 a.m. — My friend tells me that it's supposed to rain in SF today. Great. I can't find my umbrella, so I ask my mom and surprisingly, she can't find it either. Head to Target to snag a tiny umbrella and I am still way ahead of schedule. Go me. $16.38 10 a.m. — I reach the BART station and panic a bit as I can't find parking. I have to drive around for a while before I resort to parking in a carpool spot. Thankfully, it's only a carpool spot until 10 a.m., so I think I'm in the clear. 10:15 a.m. — I buy a round-trip BART ticket that will take me to the Civic Center/UN Plaza station and back ($13.60). I don't have a Clipper Card because I don't take BART enough, but I could've saved about 50 cents one way if I had just borrowed my friend's. Oh well. Parking costs another $3, but I have the Chase Sapphire Reserve card and any travel expenses are considered part of my annual $300 travel credit so I'll be reimbursed. ($16.60 reimbursed) 12 p.m. — I make it into the city and hail a Lyft Line since I have time to spare. My driver is super nice and chatty and plays cool Jamaican music that makes me feel like I'm on a tropical island and not in gloomy SF. It takes 26 minutes to get to my destination in the beautiful Presidio. ($7.87 reimbursed) 12:26 p.m. — I wanted to be dropped off at the nearby Starbucks, but it turns out the area is a cluster of office buildings and Starbucks is in this cluster. A bit confusing for me and my Lyft driver. I really only wanted to use the restroom to freshen up, so I pop in and hope no baristas tell me the restroom is for customers only. 12:35 p.m. — This is a really, really nice area. The commute would suck if I was offered this position and accepted, but I can see the Palace of Fine Arts from the bench by the lake and wow. Breathtaking. 12:50 p.m. — I make my way to the office only to find out I'm completely lost. I have a horrible sense of direction so the map doesn't even help. I eventually find the building but alas, I have entered from the wrong side. I panic because I'm always early, especially to interviews, but I can't find the security guard from whom I am supposed to get a visitor's badge. Thankfully, I find it with a few minutes to spare and he tells me the office is just a few steps away. I breathe a sigh of relief and enter my interview. 3 p.m. — Fini! I think the interview went pretty well, and I actually really enjoyed talking to the team members. I was hoping this wouldn't happen because the commute would play a huge role in my decision if I'm fortunate enough to get offered the job. One of the women I was supposed to meet with today went home sick, and they asked me to come back to meet her. Thankfully, I have another interview in the city next Tuesday so I agree to stop by then. 3:15 p.m. — I scheduled a phone interview after this onsite. This was a reschedule, so I wanted to do it as soon as she was available. It lasted 30 minutes longer than I thought it would ... and I was sitting outside on a bench the entire time. It was hard to keep my papers from getting blown away and hearing her with the bustle of traffic hour. 4:09 p.m. — Another Lyft line from another exciting Lyft driver. He yells my name as soon as I open the car door as if we're best friends who haven't seen each other in years. I love it. He talks to me about odors in Lyfts, how they come about, and how drivers should handle them. ($4.83 reimbursed) 5:15 p.m. — By the time I get back to my car, I'm FAMISHED and craving a McChicken sandwich from McDonald's. I text my boyfriend, M., to inform him of my desire, and he encourages me to get one as a reward for interviewing. I happily oblige and pull up to the McDonald's drive-through about five minutes away. I eat it so fast, I don't even get to savor the tastes. $1.09 6:15 p.m. — Finally home! What a day. I wonder how I'll deal if I get a job in the city and I have to do a similar commute every day... My mom made seafood and tofu dishes that are very comforting. I'm leaving to go to Chicago with M. and two other couple-friends early tomorrow morning, so I pack after dinner. I don't feel great going on a trip while unemployed, but it would be costlier to cancel at this point. Daily Total: $17.47",1,232
"4:40 a.m. — Blah, our flight is at 6:30 a.m. so my boyfriend and his dad are picking me up at 5. I check one last time to make sure I have everything, change, and head out the door. My mom wakes up and hands me a red envelope to wish me safe travels. She does this every time I travel somewhere; super sweet! 5:15 a.m. — We arrive at SJC and get through TSA quickly because M. and I have TSA Precheck. It's free with our Sapphire Reserve cards, but I think I would pay for it regardless. I hate waiting in lines, especially unpredictable ones. We make our way to the lounge because we both have the Priority Pass, another Sapphire Reserve perk. I munch on a few hard-boiled eggs doused with Tabasco, and half a peanut butter and honey bagel, while M. devours yogurt and fruit. We both drink copious amounts of OJ. All the food and drinks (including alcohol) are free in the lounge! 6 a.m. — As we make our way to our gate, we hear our names being called. Boarding only started 10 minutes ago, but I guess Alaska Airlines is super punctual because they're already starting to call names for people who are “late” to board. We're two of the last people on the jet, so they changed our seats and we're no longer sitting near our friends. 8:30 a.m. — Touchdown in Seattle for our short layover. I hunt for food because I'm ravenous and know I won't be eating until 4 p.m. Chicago time. I get in a super-long line for a jalapeño cheddar bagel breakfast sandwich which was satisfying, but I wish the bagel had more jalapeños. I eat half and wrap up the other half to eat during the flight. (Of course, I end up eating the rest of the sandwich five minutes later.) $8.79 4 p.m. — WE MADE IT. I was afraid there would be delays due to the weather, but we got lucky! Taking a Lyft for six people would cost around $60 and an hour's time, but public transportation cost half that price for the same amount of time, so we opt for transit. I get CTA passes for the group to speed things along ($30). I'll add this to Splitwise (super helpful app that syncs with Venmo) to get paid back later by my friends. $5 6 p.m. — After a successful train ride and a bus fail (we were going in the wrong direction), we decide to hail a Lyft to get to our Airbnb. I do the duty and snag one that only comes to $22.14. Add to Splitwise. We all change and brace for the cold (it's seven degrees outside). $3.36 7:30 p.m. — We have reservations at Girl & The Goat at 9:15, but we are all famished from a day of traveling so we head to The Pizza Parlor about a block away for appetizers. We get nachos, fried calamari, fries, and a pretty strong punch bowl to share. The Queen of Clumsy, a.k.a. me, knocks over her first glass of punch. All of the food was really good, especially the nachos. It comes on a platter of individual portions of nachos, so each bite had all the toppings. My friend picks up the tab and adds it to Splitwise. $22.98 8:30 p.m. — We head to a bar across the street called The Fox Bar. I don't get anything because the 1.5 cups of punch I had already got me a little buzzed. (I am lightweight.) The bar is incredibly intimate with lots of character; I wish we had bars like this back home. The men get seasonal drinks and we all join in on a game of HQ. We make it to question eight before we lose. 8:50 p.m. — A couple of my friends love alcohol so we head to another bar/restaurant upstairs in the same building called The Allis. Very bourgie. The waiter takes too long helping other patrons, so we have to leave after a few glasses of water. Can't miss Girl & The Goat! 9:15 p.m. — OMG I'm so excited. I looked at reservations two months in advance, and there were only two left for the weekend we were going. I booked both time slots because again, I'm anal and couldn't risk missing out. 10:30 p.m. — Wow, that was so good. So good. The restaurant is tapas-style and many of their dishes feature goat. (Go figure.) We ordered 10 for the six of us to share, and it was the perfect amount. Some of my favorites were the goat and chorizo pizza, goat empanadas, scallops, and the pig face (get this dish!). I highly recommend this restaurant, but you probably have to book a couple of months in advance. M. foots the bill of $234.15 and we split on Splitwise. $39.02 11 p.m. — We walk in the frigid temperatures to Three Dots and a Dash, an underground tiki bar that we probably wouldn't have found without the help of a homeless man. Very cool bar, but how do Chicagoans deal with wearing all these winter coats, scarves, beanies, and gloves and constantly having to take them off and put them back on?! Freezing outside, then hot inside. I'm spoiled by California weather. Anyways, I get a really good drink but I don't remember what it's called. It was served in a totem pole! $20 12:30 a.m. — Back to our super cute Airbnb. The only downside is there's only one bathroom, something we didn't realize until after we booked this spot. Showers all around and a few competitive rounds of Taboo later, we all return to our respective rooms. I then proceeded to KTFO. First night in Chicago and I'm lovin' it already! Daily Total: $99.15",2,232
"9:15 a.m. — We're out the door and it's one degree outside. My body doesn't know how to handle this. Walk to the transit station since it's only a few minutes away. M. foots the day passes for everyone, and someone makes racist comments to my group (we're all Asian) while we wait for the train. It's hard just standing there and taking it, but some people are ignorant and don't deserve my time of day. $10 9:45 a.m. — We make it to Wildberry Cafe near Millenium Park. I get the Slow Roasted Brisket Hash, and OMG, droooool. I'm not a big fan of breakfast food, but that was probably one of the best breakfasts I've ever had. The portions are MASSIVE, but M. and I annihilate that thing. He gets a veggie-filled omelet, but I think I can confidently declare my choice supreme. $19.78 11 a.m. — Backtrack to Ross a block away since my friends need thicker socks and a beanie. Head over to Millennium Park after since it's across the street. Didn't know the Bean was here, but hooray for randomly crossing off a touristy destination! 11:30 a.m. — Coffee break at Goddess Café. M. and I actually get tea because we're not big coffee drinkers ($3 to M.). The perfect solution to another cold day. Hop into a Lyft ($2.15 for my share) to go to the Field Museum! $5.15 12 p.m. — Okay, The Field Museum is insanely extensive and I couldn't even see all the exhibits before tapping out. There are LOTS of things to see here (animals, history, science, and more), and for $20 (student pricing), it's well worth it. Struggled again with managing my winter gear. I ended up sweating a lot. $20 3 p.m. — Thankfully, the Shedd Aquarium is right next door so we waddle on over. Why is admission $20 more for out-of-state visitors?! Very cool aquarium regardless — but I'm not sure if it beats Monterey Bay Aquarium. $40 5 p.m. — I'm all museum-ed and aquarium-ed out. Starving again. Hop on a Lyft to Portillo's ($4.49 for my share) to get a hot dog because Chicago. M. and I got two Chicago-style dogs and a regular fries to share. It's a very solid hot dog, but nothing special. They're also pretty small. Or maybe I'm just really hungry? $8.49 6 p.m. — Stop by Walgreens across the street to pick up a few gallons of water since our Airbnb only provides old milk. I also get hand warmers because gloves just aren't cutting it. We see a puffy little boy in a stroller who resembles the Michelin Man, and I just about melt from cuteness. M. pays. 7:30 p.m. — Back at our Airbnb thanks to another Lyft ($6.02 for my share). Got ready to head out again, then made our way to Gus' Fried Chicken. We got a 16-piece meal for four of us to share, a four-piece tender meal for the other two, mac and cheese, baked beans, potato salad, and coleslaw. Oh, and sweet tea for everyone! Stupid-sweet but highly addictive. I love fried chicken, but Gus' only serves spicy fried chicken and I wish it was spicier ($16.04). $22.06 9 p.m. — My friend made reservations at a super unique but pricey bar called The Aviary. The experience is unparalleled, but I'm not a big drinker so I don't know if I would go back and pay those prices again. My drinks weren't bad, but I don't think I appreciate alcohol enough to love their cocktail options. Regardless, if you get a chance, go for the experience. All of their food is enough for one person only, but my two girlfriends and I shared this matcha ice cream dessert. So yum. $59 11 p.m. — We meet up with our friend's cousins who live in Chicago ($3.15 for Lyft), and they bring us to the Navigator Taproom. Cool spot with poppin' music. I want to dance so badly but I am shy and it is a taproom. I'm already buzzed at this point, so I opt out of alcohol again. There were so many beers and ciders I wanted to try! I did indulge in free popcorn though. $3.15 12 a.m. — We walk to a bar down the street and all the Christmas lights dangling from the ceiling reminded me of . More poppin' music, but at least I get to dance this time! I definitely feel extremely Bay Area because my friends and I dance like we would at home but everyone else is just … standing there. Unsurprisingly, it's hard to dance with a coat, scarf, and beanie on. We leave after less than half an hour for late-night ramen! 12:30 a.m. — The friend who has cousins in Chi is drunk at this point. I find it low-key hilarious because this is his girlfriend's first time seeing him on this level and she is not having it. (They have been dating for about four months.) Still, he is having the time of his life with his family and that's all that really matters, right? We go to Furious Spoon for ramen and you guessed it, more alcohol. M. and I get the Furious ramen to share, and it is pretty good for a ramen joint that probably serves drunkards. I pay. $17.24 1:30 a.m. — We hail a Lyft back to our Airbnb ($2.94). Drunk friend throws up all his ramen and we see it frozen on the ground the next morning. M. and I chat for a while about traveling in a group, especially with three couples. We're all at different stages in our relationships and it's interesting to see the dynamics between each couple. Most of us have been friends for years though, so nothing is too new. $2.94 4 a.m. — I get up to pee and my friend, who has been summoned to the couch per his girlfriend's adamant demand, scares the shit out of me because he pops up like a zombie from his sleep. M., my other friend, and I try to get him to drink water. Our efforts are futile. Daily Total: $207.81",3,232
"11 a.m. — It's our last full day in Chicago. One thing I don't enjoy about traveling in groups is that everyone wakes up at different times. M. and I are early birds, and when we travel, we stick to that schedule so we can take advantage of our time in a new city. It's a little frustrating, but what can you do? On a brighter note, we call a Lyft to head to Eataly for lunch! $3.51 12:30 p.m. — So. Much. Italian. food. We chose four pastas and a pizza for lunch in the upstairs restaurant. My expectations were too high, but I was still happy. My friend drunkenly left his camera at The Aviary the previous night, but I picked it up in secret. We try to ride out not telling him for as long as possible, but after lunch, we spill the beans and even get the waiter in on the prank. We have several hearty laughs, and I my friend treats me to pistachio and coffee gelato. Thanks, buddy! $20.89 1 p.m. — Get a four-pack of adorably tiny pastries from the stand next to the gelato. So delectable. Only four out of the six of us are up for the chilly challenge of trekking to the Skydeck, which takes about half an hour. Lucky for me, majority rules. I prefer walking when I can to take in the scenic views and really get to experience the city! $6.47 1:30 p.m. — Skydeck's lines are so long and it is so, so hot in there. As a roller coaster enthusiast, I thought I was set with heights forever. That was true until I stepped onto the Ledge at the Skydeck. Never again. At least our pictures are cute. I also witnessed a proposal! My heart. $24 3 p.m. — We find a photo booth near the Skydeck's gift shop! M. and I hop in after our friends. He charges it to his card. 3:30 p.m. — Lyft over to Lincoln Park Zoo to check out the few animals that can survive in the winter as well as their Zoo Lights. I love that this zoo is open 365 days a year and admission is free! $4 5:15 p.m. — Lyft to Pequod's Pizzeria ($2.39)! I'm stoked because I love pizza but have been a fan of thin crust my whole life. I was lucky enough to snag reservations at 6 p.m. a few weeks earlier, but I wasn't sure if that meant we just got priority wait times or we actually had reservations. We get there about 20 minutes early, and ended up getting seated at 6 p.m.! $2.39 7 p.m. — We order a deep-dish pizza (sausage, pepperoni, and garlic on half), but that thing takes 45 minutes and I pretty much inhale it when it came. The friends who didn't want garlic quickly realized their mistake. I'm a strong believer in garlic making everything better. Pequod's definitely lived up to the hype for me! $6.21 8 p.m. — Tonight was declared munchies night because it was our last night in Chicago. Lyft to Crisp for Korean fried chicken. $2.75 8:15 p.m. — Man, this place is tiny AF. There's nowhere to stand and I spin in circles moving around for everyone. We order five wings for the six of us to share since we only wanted to try it. Very yummy food in a very, very cramped space. $2.39 9 p.m. — Next stop: Honey Butter Fried Chicken. Sadly, I don't love this place. It's a modern twist on classic southern fried chicken, but I'll stick with the original. $4.42 9:40 p.m. — Hop off a Lyft ($4.09) and into Mindy's Hot Chocolate. To my surprise, it is a sit-down restaurant with a 45 to 60-minute wait, so we get three old-fashioned hot chocolates to-go (one per couple). So good! It tastes like a real chocolate bar was melted to become a delicacy. So satisfying on a cold Chicago night. I pay for our hot chocolate ($12.16). $16.25 10 p.m. — Last stop of the night: Small Cheval. We had plans to go to the famous Au Cheval, but they were closed due to renovations. Bummer. Thankfully, Small Cheval doesn't disappoint! I'm utterly stuffed at this point, but I have the mentality of eating as much as I can in a new city. The four of us get a cheeseburger and fries to share, and I wish that was one of our actual meals. I would've been so content eating a full cheeseburger and order of fries myself. They basically have garlic aioli on tap. If Small Cheval is this good, I wonder how Au Cheval tastes. $4.75 11 p.m. — Lyft back to the Airbnb ($4). Everyone was too tired to hit up one last bar, so we opted for a movie night instead. Started with and ended with . To be honest, that was the perfect way to end our trip. $4 Daily Total: $102.03",4,232
"11 a.m. — Check out of our Airbnb and take a Lyft to Wasabi for ramen. $7.61 12 p.m. — M. and I share the spicy black garlic ramen (must try!) and a wagyu beef rice bowl. We also ordered a takoyaki to share with the whole table, and they accidentally send us a second order out and tell us to keep it! $22.79 12:30 p.m. — Lyft to O'Hare airport. Until next time, Chi-beria! $2.46 5:30 p.m. — We land in SEA again for a layover, and I'm desperately craving clam chowder. Thankfully, there's a restaurant near our gate that sells it. M. pays while I dash to the restroom. 8 p.m. — Back in San Jose. My parents pick us up, and I'm disappointed that my puppy isn't in the car. Drop off M., who lives three minutes away, and make my way home to be greeted by my overly-excited pup! 9 p.m. — I knock out. Traveling is tough. Daily Total: $32.86",5,232
"8 a.m. — Wake up to take my pup out. He's an eight-month-old Terrier mix and we adopted him last summer after our old dog passed away the previous year. I love having a dog in my life. 2 p.m. — I finally get to try on a pair of booties from Urban Outfitters and a pair of heels from ASOS that arrived while I was in Chicago — both of which I got on sale. The booties are painfully uncomfortable, and the heels are not my style after all. At least that means I will get $65 back. 5 p.m. — Spent a good chunk of my day trying to prepare for another onsite interview tomorrow. I got distracted and freak out when I realize the time and see I h've barely gotten anything done. I resort to doing laundry and choosing my interview outfit. 11 p.m. — Sleep time. Daily Total: $0",6,232
"8 a.m. — Another day, another interview. As much as I complain, I'm very grateful that I'm given these opportunities. I've only been applying to companies in the city because there are more creative options there. The commute is not ideal, but I have a better chance of finding a job I'll love. 9:30 a.m. — Head out to the South Fremont/Warm Springs BART station today because it's closer. Fare and parking come out to $17.50 but it's reimbursed by my Reserve card ($17.50). I still have my brand new umbrella because it actually did not rain last week. 11 a.m. — I arrive in SF, and it turns out the office is near the Pier! I'm really hitting all the offices in prime locations. I'm early (as usual) and a bit hungry, so I walk to a Starbucks close to the office for a croissant and a restroom break. $2.45 11:45 a.m. — Interview time! I really liked the people, but I end up not advancing in the interview process. I'm okay though because their reasoning is something I am not surprised by, and the hiring manager told me I am a high performer and wants to stay connected. Plus one for a networking opportunity. 1:20 p.m. — I have a little over an hour and a half to kill before my next interview, so I walk over to Onigilly and get a rice bowl. $11.91 2:15 p.m. — Lyft line over to the next interview. ($5.92 reimbursed) 3:30 p.m. — The hiring manager allocated an hour for this interview, but we end up chatting for only half an hour. I felt better about speaking with the team members last week than I did with today's manager. I'm nervous because she is the one I would report to, so I'm not sure how this will turn out. Fingers crossed. Lyft to the Embarcadero BART station. I really wanted to get a burrito from El Farolito, but I remind myself of everything I ate in Chicago and focus on getting home ASAP. ($7.24 reimbursed) 5:15 p.m. — I am home and go straight for the food. I eat my mom's feast of a pork and egg dish, another red pork dish, green beans, and ginger soup since a couple people in my family are sick. I was planning to complete a skills assessment test tomorrow, but I start working on it after I eat dinner to get it out of the way. I start to feel a bit down and worry that I won't get to move forward with that position, so I start maniacally applying to jobs. 8:30 p.m. — I texted M. earlier about wanting to get boba, so when I tell him I finished the assessment early, he asks if I want to go celebrate. I pick him up for boba nearby and get a yogurt green tea. M. pays for the drinks, but I end up wanting a snack and getting fried squid rings. It's a great deal because it's happy hour! $4.34 10 p.m. — Get home, shower, nightly skincare routine, in bed by 10:30. Good night, world. Daily Total: $18.70",7,232
"7:15 a.m. — Usually I wake up before my alarm, but today it jolts me out of a weird dream. Ugh, Monday. I roll out of bed and throw some scrubs on. 7:30 a.m. — I make oatmeal with peanut butter, honey, and cinnamon. I also pour myself a big cup of cold, black coffee. I brew a pot of coffee on Sunday nights and stick it in the fridge for a whole week. It's not an ideal system, but I prefer it 100 times more than fresh hot coffee. 7:50 a.m. — I'm out the door. Luckily, I both live and work downtown, so it's a 10-minute walk into the hospital. I like to jam out on the way there; today, it's Arcade Fire's newest album. 8:05 a.m. — I get to work early and talk to the security guard about my weekend; it's our Monday tradition. She teases me for staying in St. Pete this weekend. I traveled a lot this summer and there's a running joke between us now that I'm ""always going somewhere."" 8:30 a.m. — I'm a coffee fiend and usually cave to the coffee shop in our hospital on Monday mornings. I'm going to Nashville with friends in a couple of weeks, so I'm trying not to waste my money on coffee. One of my coworkers brings me a coffee without me asking because she is an angel. 12 p.m. — I meal prep for the whole week during the weekend, so I usually have all of my lunches and dinners made in advance. This saves me money and ensures that I eat clean for most of the week. For lunch today, I have a sriracha, garlic, and honey pork chop with diced sweet potatoes and asparagus. 5:15 p.m. — Done with work. I walk back and talk to my mom on the phone. Back at home, I immediately scarf down homemade peanut butter granola. I eat enough to make it a not-healthy snack anymore. 6:15 p.m. — I hit up a barre class. My studio gives me a student discount and I go enough to make it a great deal. 7:45 p.m. — Back from barre, I eat dinner: zucchini noodles with carrots, onions, and peppers in red sauce. I watch two lectures for school, text my boyfriend for a little bit, and later snack on homemade chocolate chip cookies that my Dad sent me. He got a mixer for his birthday and is so excited to make things with it. 9:15 p.m. — I make peppermint tea and slide into bed. Tomorrow is an early day. Daily Total: $0",1,233
"5 a.m. — I wake up for work. Three days a week, I work overtime in surgery. The early mornings are brutal, but the pay is worth it. I don't have to be at the hospital until 5:30, and luckily I live close enough to basically wake up at the last possible second. I drive to work on these mornings because it's still dark outside. 5:25 a.m. — I clock into work and roll through my routine. I packed a breakfast of peanut butter granola, almonds, and blueberries and snack before patients start coming. I also chug my cold coffee from home. 8:30 a.m. — My time in the OR is complete, and I run to the other side of the hospital to get to my clinic. 8:35 a.m. — We don't have patients until 9 and I'm still hungry, so I go to the cafeteria and grab two hard-boiled eggs and a cup of ice for my coworker. With my discount it's $2.38, but I can use my hospital badge to have it payroll deducted. $2.38 11 a.m. — I've been lucky with grad school so far and haven't had to buy any mandatory textbooks ... until now. I'm in my last semester and have to buy two. I order them on Amazon Prime in between patients; my parents pay. When I started college, they told me that as long as I was in school, they'd cover my books. Yes, they're the greatest. ($170, covered by my mom) 12 p.m. — I eat my leftover zucchini noodles from last night and have lots of yummy red sauce left over, so I buy a piece of grilled chicken from the cafeteria to finish it off. It's $3.18, but payroll deducted. I also eat some blueberries, blackberries, and strawberries that I packed. $3.18 12:40 p.m. — I'm trying SO hard not to spend money on coffee, but I literally just fell asleep at my desk. Halfway to walking to the hospital coffee shop, I remember we have a lone K-cup in the office cabinet. I turn around and go back; it's good for me to get the steps anyway. 3 p.m. — The surgeon I work for hits the proverbial wall and is in desperate need of caffeine. He asks if anyone wants anything from the coffee shop and takes me with him because I'm the only one who can remember everyone's order. I get a double espresso. 5:15 p.m. — Done with patients and drive to a hot yoga class. I started doing yoga at my barre studio when I sent out my applications to medical school. I was so anxious that I stopped sleeping, and it's helped a lot so far. 7:30 p.m. — Back from yoga, showered, and I FaceTime my mom while I eat: roasted pork chop, broccoli stalks, sweet potatoes, and strawberries as a snack. 8:15 p.m. — I talk to my boyfriend while I eat a peanut butter granola bar from Trader Joe's. I get really snacky in the evenings and I'm trying to break the habit. I rationalize it by telling myself I worked it off in yoga. 9 p.m. — I need to study, but instead I watch while drinking peppermint tea. I'll make up for studying tomorrow. The special has some really funny and really cringeworthy parts. I pass out in bed by 10. Daily Total: $5.56",2,233
"7:15 a.m. — No surgery for me today! I wake up extremely well-rested and make myself breakfast — oatmeal with peanut butter, honey, cinnamon, and chopped strawberries. I drink cold coffee from my fridge. 7:40 a.m. — I'm either feeling particularly ambitious or very alert because I unload and reload my dishwasher after breakfast. I'm going away to see my boyfriend this weekend and my roommate is in Nashville, so I want us to both come home to a clean apartment. 7:50 a.m. — I'm out the door and walking to work. Today's playlist is 2000s hip-hop. I get very hype to ""Air Force Ones"". 8:05 a.m. — I clock into work early again and head over to trauma, where I work every Wednesday morning. It started as a PRN gig, but both parties enjoyed it so much that I've stayed there permanently. There is always a pot of coffee brewed, and I drink some while I catch up with the front desk staff on hospital gossip. 10:15 a.m. — I'm starving and eat some blueberries, blackberries, and strawberries during a gap between patients. 11:30 a.m. — We've finished seeing patients and I see that John Mulaney is coming to the theater RIGHT near my apartment building. My roommate and I love him so I buy the two of us and her friend tickets as she's busy in Nashville. We can't believe our luck. She immediately Venmos me for their share. $33 12 p.m. — I eat lunch (pork chop, broccoli stalk, mushrooms, and sweet potatoes), but I'm still hungry after. I find cinnamon BelVita cookies in my backpack. I have in my backpack, I swear. 5:15 p.m. — Done seeing patients and I head straight to CVS. I got my hair done in February for my birthday, and while the stylist did an amazing job, I'm sick of the blonde. I'm a brunette at heart! I buy a box of light brown Revlon dye on sale. $8.52 6:30 p.m. — My hair looks good! It's a little ashy but since the dye is cheap it should fade a bit within a week. I eat dinner while my hair dries. 7:30 p.m. — I study until 10, then make peppermint tea, talk to my boyfriend for a bit, and pass out in bed. Daily Total: $41.52",3,233
"5 a.m. — My alarm goes off and I am sad. I go through my usual routine of blind fumbling to get dressed and grab my food. I clock into work just after 5:15 and start setting up for our day of patients. After I'm finished, I watch the morning news while eating hard-boiled eggs and drinking coffee from home. I'm especially tired for some reason today. 8:30 a.m. — I leave the OR and head over to my side of the hospital for clinic. We're slammed with patients — thank the medical gods that my coffee is finally kicking in. 11:58 a.m. — We somehow finish with our patients on time! I think if I eat another pre-packed pork chop meal, I'm going to kill someone, so I grab Tijuana Flats with my coworkers. I get a blackened chicken burrito bowl and it is good. $8.53 4:45 p.m. — Finish with our afternoon patients early, too! Sometimes, I really underestimate my doctor; he was on a roll today. I change out of my scrubs at the office and drive over to barre for a class. 6:30 p.m. — My barre instructor went rogue today and now I can't feel my legs. 7:15 p.m. — I think the burrito bowl was the cure for my brief pork chop strike, because I happily eat my usual meal this week when I get home while I FaceTime my mom. After I eat, I end up studying for a bit. 8:50 p.m. — The snack attack strikes again. I grab some blueberries and almonds while talking to my boyfriend, make myself a Sleepytime peach tea (not peppermint, wow), and scroll through social media. I fall asleep before 9:30.

"5 a.m. — My last time this week waking up at 5! I have more energy today and roll through my morning routine faster than usual. I eat peanut butter oatmeal with blueberries and a cold coffee for breakfast. 5:15 a.m. — I clock into work and do my usual boring routine. I only drink about half my coffee before the patients start rolling in. 8:30 a.m. — We don't see patients on Fridays in clinic, so our schedule is massively laid back. I tell my front desk secretary I'll be late and pick up everyone a coffee and a donut from Dunkin'. I have coupons with me and get four coffees and four donuts. $5.11 8:42 a.m. — I'm back at my desk and working on getting authorizations for patient procedures. I drink my caramel iced coffee and eat my donut — old fashioned is the best. 12 p.m. — I clock out of work and go back to my apartment to deep clean and pack for my weekend trip to Gainesville. Usually, I leave at 5 but my boyfriend and I have an obligation this evening. 12:45 p.m. — Packed in my car ready to go and realize that I need gas. I get gas maybe once a month because the furthest I drive is to go to barre class. I don't even know if I'm getting a particularly good deal at this station or not. I get nine gallons. $18.19 3 p.m. — Finally with my man! We are staying at his parents' house, and we chill for a bit before his mom comes home. She arrives with strawberry popsicles. 7 p.m. — I have been waiting for this event FOREVER. My boyfriends mom is a barre instructor and they're doing a “Bring-A-Boy” class tonight. She's an insanely hard teacher, but watching my boyfriend and his dad flounder through the class is worth every ounce of pain. After, we eat soft pretzels and beer that the studio provides. 8 p.m. — His parents take us to dinner at a local Mexican restaurant. I get fish tacos and we split a margarita pitcher between the table. They graciously pay. 9:30 p.m. — The combo of the margarita and my early wakeup time has me down for the count. I pass out as soon as we get back to the house. Daily Total: $23.30",5,233
"8:30 a.m. — I wake up well-rested. My boyfriend has breakfast plans for us, so I roll out of bed and into his car. 9:15 a.m. — Points for my boy, he takes us to a bomb Southern breakfast place. I get a biscuit with fried chicken, cheddar cheese, bacon, and sausage gravy on top. I can feel my arteries clogging as I eat it but its too good! I also get a red eye to wake myself up. $13.31 10:30 a.m. — We should be taking a carb nap but I have a molecular genetics exam in two weeks and I want to get ahead before I leave for Nashville. We go to a local coffee shop where I love to study. I order a honey and cinnamon coffee. $3.67 1:30 p.m. — We finish studying and one of my friends is in the area. We stay at the coffee shop a little longer so she can meet us there and we can catch up. She starts medical school on Monday! 2:30 p.m. — I want to go thrifting to see if there are any cute, cheap outfits I can get before my trip. After about 30 minutes of searching, I'm overwhelmed and give up. (I'm a very impatient shopper.) My boyfriend gets a pair of pants and I leave empty-handed. 5:30 p.m. — My boyfriend's father's birthday is this week, and we go out to dinner to celebrate with their friends. We tear into a seafood boil; it's more than I've eaten in a while. Again, his lovely parents treat us. 8:30 p.m. — We're absolutely stuffed from dinner but are still craving DQ blizzards. I get a small Reese's Blizzard and go back to the house to watch with my boyfriend's mom. $3.72 10 p.m. — I snuggle with my boyfriend for a bit and fall asleep before 11. Daily Total: $20.70",6,233
"7:30 a.m. — My boyfriend wakes me up early so I can watch him play soccer. He's pretty good (and cute), so I forgive the early morning wakeup. I eat peanut butter and honey oatmeal before we leave. 9 a.m. — It's five million degrees in Florida and there's about six inches of shade on the soccer field. I sweat my butt off spectating while my boyfriend does actual exercise. They get their asses kicked. 10 a.m. — We decide to get post-game açai bowls for breakfast. As we pull in the parking lot, I realize I don't have my wallet with me, so my boyfriend and I split a bowl that he covers. 10:30 a.m. — The açai bowl place is next to the coffee shop from yesterday, and I'm craving another honey and cinnamon coffee. I think my boyfriend notices my longing glances and offers to get me one. I accept. 11:45 a.m. — We go to a local hip grocery store to get poke bowls. While we wait for them to be made, I wander around and grab produce I'll need for the week. I end up getting broccoli, four packs of blueberries, asparagus, green beans, and peanut butter. I also cover both of our poke bowls and coffee from earlier. $34.25 1 p.m. — We finish eating lunch and sadly, I have to leave. My boyfriend will also be in Tennessee next week on a completely different trip, and we know we will see each other in Nashville at least one night. 4 p.m. — After a dramatic and awful drive home, I'm back in St. Pete. I FaceTime my mom and lay in bed to rest up before my game. I joined a co-ed softball league that plays in a park in the city. I played for 14 years, and it's great to have the game back in my life. 6 p.m. — I'm extremely lazy and drive instead of walk to the park for my softball game. I get nailed in the leg with a line drive, which quickly turns into a gnarly bruise. We lose, but I have a great time. 7:30 p.m. — I run over to Publix to get meat and fruit for the week. I didn't want to make the drive from Gainesville with poultry. I buy chicken thighs, eggs, strawberries, and arugula and get yelled at for walking around in cleats. $14.76 8 p.m. — I shower and start to cook for the week. I make a quick dinner of honey-lime-cilantro chicken with arugula and green beans and watch the sun set on the rooftop patio with my roommate while we catch up. 9 p.m. — I eat cinnamon BelVita crisps while I study with my roommate. Later, I text my boyfriend for a bit and then go to bed. Daily Total: $49.01",7,233
"8:30 a.m. — I wake up and snuggle my kitties. I work doubles on Sundays (managing in the morning, serving at night) and I don't want to leave my bed. Eventually, I get up and put on coffee for me and feed the cats. I pack my bag for the day with breakfast and snacks: coffee, my water bottle, Ezekiel bread with peanut butter, a banana, a yogurt, and a KIND bar. I live across the street from the restaurant where I work and arrive by 10 a.m. 3:30 p.m. — A fairly busy afternoon, but that makes the time fly. I order the special for lunch — a sliced turkey sandwich with goat cheese, arugula, sun-dried tomato pesto, and balsamic glaze. It's $12, but I get a free meal when I manage and 50% off my meal when I serve. I eat quickly during a lull and get ready to be on the floor as a server by 4 p.m. 8:30 p.m. — This night was dead. I debate ordering dinner at work, but I don't want to spend money. I am cut super early and pop into my house to feed the cats and change into comfy clothes; the perks of living across the street from work! I'm going back to work at 9 p.m. to collaborate with the general manager on new tasks I'll be taking over from her. I heat up some leftover shredded pork and sauerkraut my mom gave me and head back to the restaurant. 11:30 p.m. — We are finally done work! I get two shift drinks as a manager. The GM and I have a glass of wine and talk about how stupid Yelp is. My boyfriend is the sous chef and joins us when he is done. I don't have a tab but tip the bartender. $10 Daily Total: $10",1,234
"8 a.m. — Up and putting a pot of coffee on. A plumber is coming around 8:45. My boyfriend and I have a great apartment in a cute town and can walk to work — but the apartment is OLD. A pipe has been leaking and is getting fixed today. I feed the cats and apologize in advance to them that they will be confined to our bedroom while the plumber works. I do some work from home while he is here, which ends up being an almost three-hour job. I don't know exactly how much the job costs but I do know my landlord was not happy! 12 p.m. — I made a late breakfast (brunch? lunch?) of guac on Ezekiel toast and egg whites with Everything But The Bagel Seasoning (my favorite!) and cheddar jack cheese. I put in a load of laundry and tidy up around the house. 2 p.m. — I head to the grocery store for my weekly trip. I get cat food, cat litter, paper towels, toilet paper, a few candles, Clorox wipes, Banza pasta, sauce, bananas, avocados, rice cakes, tuna, yogurt, coffee, creamer, Ezekiel bread, peanut butter, and Oreos. I usually buy household items only once or twice a month so this week's bill is still more than I like to spend at the grocery store. Though my boyfriend and I live together we eat VERY different things, and with our work schedules we are not home for meals together very often. The food I buy is generally just for myself. I get a lot of the household items on sale and save over $12 with my store card. $112.84 9:30 p.m. — It has been sleeting and snowing all night, so my night as manager-on-duty consisted of salting the walkway to the restaurant every half hour. I had a ton of staff show up late, a call out, and a lot of very unhappy servers because of how slow it was. I use my manager meal comp to get a salad to-go, because I plan to go to the gym after work. Better late than never. 11:30 p.m. — I get home from the gym and eat my salad with a side of Oreos. The girl who lives in the apartment above me texts me and I invite her over for a little. We are both crazy cat ladies and watch cat videos and play with my cats and talk about how much we love cats — normal things. My boyfriend gets home from work shortly after and we all watch an episode of This new season is too good! Daily Total: $112.84",2,234
"10 a.m. — My boyfriend left around 7 a.m. (he has his son today) and I slept in. I drink some coffee and sift through emails. My last semester of grad school starts in three weeks and I've been purposely avoiding my school email because I'm enjoying my break! I'm getting a master's degree in nonprofit leadership, but after working in administration at a homeless shelter early last year, I don't know if I like nonprofit work after all. It's very stressful and there are a lot of very unethical practices. I do, however, LOVE volunteering, and I've been emailing a ton of animal shelters about opportunities. I eat egg whites and Ezekiel toast with guac for breakfast. 11:30 a.m. — I'm prepping veggies to make a lentil stew when my boyfriend and his son come over. We all play with the cats, who are both interested and terrified of a four-year old, and watch a movie while I cook. The boys go down for their afternoon nap and I go to the gym to do a back workout. 10 p.m. — I was decently busy at work for a Tuesday. After buying dinner and tipping out (busser, food runner, bar) I made $93. $4.50 12 a.m. — A friend asked to meet up for a drink after work. I am an unapologetic homebody most of the time but I have not seen this friend in a while. We head to the neighborhood dive with my boyfriend; he plays pool, we catch up, and he pays the tab. We then walk to the bar we work at for one last drink. Boyfriend and I are both managers, so don't have a tab (as usual), but I leave a tip. $10 Daily Total: $14.50",3,234
"9:30 a.m. — Oh my god, what have I done? My head is killing me! I really can't hang like I used to. I stagger out of bed to feed the cats and get water and coffee. I decide to take a rest day from the gym and read in bed with a lap full of cats for a while. Eventually, I make Ezekiel toast with peanut butter and a banana. That combo has healing powers and I am relieved to feel like a human again. I hop in the shower and get ready to go into work at 2. 2 p.m. — Because I am a manager and I live across the street, I get called in to help quite often. I don't mind it, though. The GM has a project she's working on, so today I am managing from 2 to 5 p.m., then serving at 5 and closing the restaurant. The owner of the restaurant stops by and gives me a $50 Visa gift card because “he doesn't know how to use it” and he knows my boyfriend and I just moved. Sweet! He takes good care of his managers, and it is awesome. Feeling appreciated at a job is so important to me. 3 p.m. — I love working lunch shifts because they're laid back. I find some chicken salad in the prep kitchen and eat that with carrots I brought from home and a yogurt for lunch, and read through Yelp reviews I have to respond to. People are nuts. 11:30 p.m. — Tonight was pretty crappy for a closing shift but at least I'm done early. I made $145 after tip out and eating a salad (half-off) for dinner. I snag a leftover loaf of sourdough to eat with my stew and head home to my happy place: my bed, a book, my cats, and Oreos. $6 Daily Total: $6",4,234
"9:30 a.m. — It's my day off! Coffee time for me, breakfast time for the cats. I have a ton of things to do today because I am hosting a Secret Santa gift exchange with coworkers at my apartment tonight. After eating peanut butter on Ezekiel toast, I get right into cleaning the apartment. 12 p.m. — I stop by Ulta to buy a few more things for my Secret Santa gift. I get her nail polish, head bands, and lotion. I'm running low on a few products of my own, so I get those plus a few face masks. $62.83 2 p.m. — Once I get home, boyfriend and I stop by the liquor store. We get eight bottles of wine and he insists on adding two bottles of tequila. At least we'll be stocked for a while! He puts the total on his card and since I always have cash (#WaitressProbs), I give him cash for half of the total. $75 3 p.m. — We're making a taco bar for tonight and go all out with the fixings. I cannot believe how much money I've spent for this night, but I'm sure it'll be worth it. Once again, boyfriend puts the bill on his card and I give him cash for half. $45 7:30 p.m. — Boyfriend is hard at work prepping the taco bar while I set up appetizers and wrap my Secret Santa gifts. Once the guests show up, we pop open some wine and start celebrating! Daily Total: $182.83",5,234
"9:30 a.m. — I wake up sleepy but in a great mood! Boyfriend left to be with his son a few hours ago, and I make an egg white omelet with leftovers from last night. 2 p.m. — I eat more leftovers from last night after getting home from the gym. I check my email while getting ready for work and see that one of the shelters I reached out to has a volunteer training tomorrow. I'm in! 10 p.m. — This night at work was not great. I had “campers” all night, which is the restaurant term for people who sit around for well after they've paid so you can't get sat again. I missed out on getting a 10 top because my campers sat for an hour and a half after they paid! You win some, you lose some. I take home flank steak and brussels sprouts for dinner and walk with a measly $105 after paying for my dinner and tipping out. $7 Daily Total: $7",6,234
"9:30 a.m. — The gym was so crowded this morning but I had a great shoulder workout. I eat toast, eggs, and yogurt when I get home and give the cats their breakfast. I snap a picture of them playing with their new toys from the Secret Santa to send to my friend. They are so happy! 11:30 a.m. — I put gas in my car before driving to my volunteer orientation at the animal shelter. I get gas maybe twice a month. Because we live in town, the farthest places I drive to are the gym or the grocery store, which are each under two miles away. We used to live a lot farther from work (and from pretty much everything) and I had to fill up my tank twice a week. $35 2:30 p.m. — After the orientation, I eat a quick lunch at home, then I walk down the street to the local bookstore. I have a gift card and I need new books. I love my local businesses and try to support them over big business whenever I can. I use my gift card to get (after hearing about it from another Money Diary!) and a book about living with anxiety. (Last year, I finally sought help after living with debilitating anxiety for quite some time.) Because I am a nerd, I wish I could skip work and dive into my new books. 11 p.m. — Work tonight was tragically bad, as it is every time a major Philadelphia sports team plays; we are the polar opposite of a sports bar. I made a lousy $55 after eating a turkey and brie sandwich for dinner and tipping out. I snuggle up with my cats, a glass of wine, and a book as soon as I get home. $5.25 Daily Total: $40.25",7,234
"9 a.m. — I just got back from vacation yesterday and today I'm rushing to work. Nothing says welcome back to NYC like your MetroCard saying ""insufficient funds"" when you swipe. I wait in line for 10 minutes and buy my MetroCard. 10:50 a.m. — I skipped breakfast so I'm famished by the time I get to work. My job is draining and I need to stay awake, but I have been avoiding coffee since it worsens my anxiety. I stop by Gregory's Coffee to get a Peanut Pleaser instead. It's usually $8 but I'm in their rewards program and have a $5 credit. I'm aware I can make smoothies at home, but I love to sleep and would rather sleep in than make breakfast. $3 6 p.m. — My coworker and I were supposed to go to yoga together after work but she flakes so I think about going shopping. Still, as much as I want to go shopping for home decor, as a born and bred New Yorker, I know shopping during rush hour is horrific — especially in Manhattan. I settle for going to yoga. I'm not a yoga fan but this studio plays hip hop during the class and tonight is Drake night; my day is made. 8 p.m. — I'm home because it's way too cold to be outside. After cleaning, unpacking, and dropping off laundry, I order dinner. I've been craving Thai food and place my order, paying with a Visa gift card I was given for Xmas. I eat while watching the new Dave Chappelle special on Netflix and laugh so hard I almost choke. Once it's over, I go online and see that Glossier has a 10% off sale. It's not much but I'm obsessed with skincare and I have a Sephora VIB Rouge card to prove it. I've heard a lot about Glossier and decide to finally try them. I get the Invisible Shield (you should ALWAYS wear SPF) and the moisturizing moon mask (it's winter, duh). Pay on the Visa gift card again. Daily Total: $3",1,235
"9 a.m. — Up bright and early for therapy. These few past years have been tough; I tried to cope on my own but just ended up doing impulsive shopping and skipping meals while crying in between, so I caved in and started going to therapy. It helps big time. After therapy, I head over to work. I only have a few meetings which means I'll be out early and I'll have more ""me"" time. $30 1 p.m. — Let ""me"" time commence! I head over to Pop Physique for a quick barre workout. My ex got me a package of classes for a year while we were dating since it's the only workout I enjoy. After class, I walk over to Aesop and pick up their parsley seed facial cleanser; it's pricey but I love it, so screw it. I hop on the train just before rush hour (yay!) and go home. $43 6 p.m. — I get home and before hopping in the shower, I notice that I missed a bunch of messages from a group chat I have with friends. One of my friends ended things with her boyfriend and wants to have a low-key girls' night. I suggest a few places and we all decide on a pizza and wine bar in Hell's Kitchen. I shower and get ready while listening to old school Shakira and trying to hit the high notes to ""Si Te Vas""(#fail). I drink a glass of wine and head over to the train station. I check my email while waiting for the train and find that Shopbop is 20% off. I resist the urge to shop since I don't really need anything ... but leave a few things sitting in my cart. 8:30 p.m. — I get to the restaurant first since I'm the only one that lives in Manhattan, and quickly walk over to Bibble & Sip to buy an Earl Grey vanilla cream puff. I almost pay cash until I remember my Visa gift card. We get seated and I know what I'm ordering right away; it's not my first time at the rodeo. We spend the night stuffing our faces, drinking and joking, and not talking about our friend's recent breakup, which is what she wanted. We joke about our childhoods and our coworkers. I guess I needed a night like this too but it's hard to get together with friends due to work or other commitments. The night is over and we split the bill. $67 11 p.m. — At this hour, I'll never get home if I take the subway. Plus, I had drinks and don't want to get tired on the train and wake up in another borough. I order a Lyft and my driver arrives quickly considering it's a busy street in Midtown. I get into the car and ""Careless Whisper"" is playing. I'm buzzed so naturally I start singing along — maybe too loud because my driver joins me. Ultimate New York moment. $24 12 a.m. — I go to sleep late. I have no idea why but I can't fall asleep before 1 a.m. I double-cleanse my face and put on my sleeping mask and read in bed. I'm currently reading ; the essays are fun and relatable so it's an easy read for me. Before going to sleep, I quickly FaceTime with my cousin who lives in Spain and is planning to come visit in a few weeks. Like clockwork, I pass out around 1 a.m. Daily Total: $164",2,235
"9 a.m. — I decide to work from home today. I really don't feel like going all the way to the office and quite honestly, what I have to do can be done at home. I use my Echo Dot to order a latte at Starbucks but Alexa humbles me and informs me I have to reload my Starbucks card. I add $10. I step out to pick up my latte and walk back home to start working while watching . During my break, I see that Shopbop still has 20% off. I cave, remove a few things from my cart, and order a silk sleep mask. $48 5 p.m. — I finish work and check to see if any yoga classes are open in the next hour or so. I find one and grab my mat and water and power walk over since they have a strict late policy. I get a good spot and tune everything out. After yoga, I walk over to a wine shop. I love trying new wines and I usually just buy whatever speaks to me. Today, I spot the Tituss Burgess pinot noir and instantly grab it. I loved the character on the show (give Tituss his own show!) and I've been dying to try the wine. I use whatever is left on my Visa gift card, reminding myself to check the balance. 7 p.m. — I get home and realize I'm riding the cotton pony, which explains my mood. I get ready for a night in with wine, TV, and dating apps. I check dating apps from time to time just to see if I'm ready. As soon as I sign on, I realize I'm not and save myself — and my potential date's — time and sign out. I decide to binge-watch I'm upset it took me this long to give it a chance! Jon Hamm is everything. I get interrupted by a text from my phone carrier telling me my bill has been posted. I pay it right away or else I'll forget. Daily Total: $48",3,235
"9 a.m. — IT'S FRIDAY. I've been looking forward to today because my coworkers and I planned a night out in Williamsburg after work. First I have to get through work. I stop at the deli before going to the office and get gum. I'm in the office today so it means I'm swamped with paper work. I listen to the podcast to focus and laugh. $1.75 5 p.m. — I didn't bring lunch so I decide on Mexican food for a late lunch ($5.31). I'm so swamped and focused that I lose track of time until it's 5:15 p.m. I look up from my workspace to see that my coworkers are already putting their makeup on for tonight. Apparently, I also received my MetroCard reimbursement check today. Yass! I put on my fancy face paint and we head out to Brooklyn. First stop is Croxley's Ale House for happy hour where we all pig out on quesadillas and chicken wings before bar hopping. While stuffing our faces, we try to plan where we'll go next, but it's evident that we're just going anywhere there's alcohol and good music. We split the bill. $38.31 9 p.m. — Next stop is The Woods. They have an outdoor sitting area that's heated so we order drinks and walk over. By now, we're buzzed, joking around, and having a good time. A group of guys look over and buy us all fireball shots. They walk over and tell us they are heading to Baby's All Right a couple of blocks over; they invite us and we join them. At Baby's All Right, there's a live band finishing up a set but we still get to enjoy two good songs. The guys keep buying us more drinks. One of them is chatting with me, but I'm having such a good time I just start dancing with my coworker. We get more gin and tonics and start yelling when ""Bodak Yellow"" comes on. My coworker pays for my drinks since I paid for hers last time we went out. 4 a.m. — Lose track of time and only realize it's 4 a.m. because that's when Baby's All Right closes. I decide that I must move to Williamsburg — but it'll be hard since I've been living in Manhattan all my life. Everyone starts calling their Lyfts; this time, I'm too drunk to sing along to anything, although my driver compliments me on my skin. I get home and double-cleanse my face even though I'm drunk. While doing so, I get a text from one of the guys asking me if I got home okay. I don't even remember giving him my number but the thought is appreciated. $29.60 Daily Total: $69.66",4,235
"3 p.m. — I wake up and drink water nonstop. I check my phone and see that my sister invited me out to eat. I try to get out of it since my head is throbbing, but she offers to pay and it's going to be at my favorite restaurant, a Japanese-Dominican fusion place. Miraculously, my headache is gone. I get to the place and catch up with my sister. I offer to pay my part but she refuses. 6 p.m. — I walk out of the train station and see a facial place I've been thinking about trying on the way home. They're known for their quick facials without the extra spa stuff, which is perfect. I need the pampering but I don't want a stranger touching my face for a long time. They usually don't take drop-ins but someone canceled, so I get lucky. I enjoy it because they don't push you to buy products. I walk out feeling refreshed and brand new. The guy from last night texts again and I decide to give him a chance. $75 Daily Total: $75",5,235
"2 p.m. — I love to sleep in. I lay in bed with my laptop, read Money Diaries, and share one with my sister. (I suspect it's her, but she denies it.) I also start checking out grad schools. I will be extremely broke, but I know I have to do it. What's hard is that there's nothing I feel passionate about enough to go into debt for. I start watching and for some reason get reminded that my humidifier hasn't been working. I check Amazon and find a new one right away. I pay with points. 6 p.m. — I go to see with a friend who is in love with James Franco; he offers to pay since he dragged me out on a Sunday. (Little does he know, I love James Franco as much as he does and would have gone willingly.) After the movie, I start mentally preparing for Monday and walk home while listening to an audiobook; it's terrible and I'm thankful it was free. 10 p.m. — I get home, shower, and mask. While I have my mask on, I boil water and set my Real Eats meal to cook. After dinner, I book my ballet barre classes for the week and watch reruns. This show is hilarious and the fact that my friends and I discuss it in our group chat while watching makes it even better. I do some quick online shopping on Aritzia during commercial break and get a pair of mittens, a pair of jeans, and a few tops. Their clothes look great on me so it's my go-to store. After the reruns are over, I take some melatonin and go to bed wearing my eye mask. It feels like angels are caressing my eyes as I sleep. $206.06 Daily Total: $206.06",6,235
"9 a.m. — I know everyone says it, but I'm not a Monday person. I wake up in a bad mood and feel crappy until I have coffee. I drink my coffee while listening to a podcast and getting ready. Before going into the office, I get a green smoothie from Juice Generation. I get to work and try to do as much as I can so I can leave early. The guy I met in Brooklyn texts me and wants to hang out later this week; he offers we go see a stand up and I agree. $7 3 p.m. — After work, I head over to Sephora to get foundation. I'm running low, and after years of trial and error, I finally found my perfect shade in Milk Makeup. It has SPF, which is always a plus. I have $40 left on the Sephora gift card I got for my birthday, so I only pay $2. I head over to barre class, which is very small since it's before 5 p.m. I prefer smaller groups because the instructors are more detailed and you get more one-on-one time. $2 7 p.m. — I get home and gather my laundry to drop it off. I don't have a washer-dryer in my apartment, and although there are washers and dryers in my building, I prefer to drop it off to avoid folding. I shower and order sushi for dinner ($15.60). I eat while watching reruns and then decide to read until I pass out. My plans change when the guy texts me again. Maybe I really should give him a chance; he's already winning points by inviting me to a show and being a fan. $42.60 Daily Tchaotal: $51.60",7,235
"8 a.m. — Time to wake up! I hit snooze three times because I have had a lot of late nights recently and am still trying to get back into a school and work routine. After finally rolling out of bed, I drag myself to the apartment gym and find out I need a code. Grr. I know I need to work out so I settle for a beginners' yoga tutorial on YouTube. 10 a.m. — Finished working out and checking emails. Breakfast is a bagel with lactose-free cream cheese and it hits the spot. Time to do homework until class. 12:10 p.m. — Late to my noon class ... on the first day. Thankfully, the professor is nice and lets me slide in unnoticed. 2 p.m. — Time for lunch! That two-hour class was awful and I am starving. After talking myself out of coffee, I find a spot in the library to eat and do homework. Lunch today is a quinoa bowl with chia seeds, broccoli, peas, arugula, spinach, and chickpeas. 5:30 p.m. — After being at work all afternoon, I cannot wait to eat dinner, which my roommate informed me she is making. I recently moved and love my new roommates — and the fact that they cook is big reason why. I am even more excited once I find out that she is making soup. 10 p.m. — The only downside of moving in the middle of the school year is that I'm a subletter. The person whose spot I took owned all the furniture in our apartment, so my new roommates and I are shopping for what we need today. My contribution was an insanely cheap coffee table, but once it is set up in our living room, it actually looks great and I am really happy with the purchase. $20.86 12 a.m. — It's bedtime and I am stoked. A quick shower exhausts me even more (or maybe it's the fact that I work with kids) and I fall asleep fast. Daily Total: $20.86",1,236
"8 a.m. — My goal this semester is to wake up at the same time every weekday. So far I hate it, but today I need to be up because I have class. I do a quick morning routine and make breakfast. Another bagel with cream cheese, and grapes and coffee for the road. 9:10 a.m. — Get to campus and text a friend to save me a spot. I still have plenty of time but I want to get a good spot since it is a full class. 10:40 a.m. — Class is over and I am drained. I did not get enough sleep last night (or this week) and I am really feeling it. I buy a pick-me-up Diet Coke with vanilla, glad I have something to sip while I do homework. On the way back to my car I see a ton of people I haven't seen since before winter break. We do a whole bunch of quick ""hellos"" and I'm reminded me how loved I feel in this city, even though I am far from home. $2.61 1 p.m. — Break from homework for lunch: an omelet with a variety of veggies and toast, and veggies and hummus on the side. I'm coming home from work pretty late today, and I really don't want to have to buy dinner. While browsing on Amazon, I remember that I need to buy phone charger. Thank god for Prime and free shipping. $6.54 3 p.m. — I stop and get gas on my way to work. I still have about a quarter tank but the price is good. Also, a cold front is supposed to hit around the time I'll really need to fill up and I want to save myself from suffering. $29.48 5:30 p.m. — Work killed me — the kids were wild today. I had to be stern with them for the first time and I hated it. I'm in a sour mood but am seeing my best friend today to go shopping. Retail therapy, here I come. 8 p.m. — After two hours at the mall fueled by free bagels from work, we walk out happy. I picked up two pieces of lingerie: a bold, red lacy bralette and a beautiful periwinkle teddy. I am obsessed with them, despite how expensive the purchase was. It also works out that my consistent hookup and I are meeting tonight for the first time this semester. $57.27 11:30 p.m. — I have officially blocked my hookup. He isn't great about making plans and has canceled twice in a row and I refuse to put up with that anymore. Being a millennial who is not ready to date, but is also looking for someone consistent, is really hard. I'm glad I never see this guy unless we make plans, although I will miss him. I am also PMSing so I spend the rest of my Thursday crying about a boy I never even had feelings for. Gotta love college. I told all my roommates he was coming over so now I have to do a different walk of shame to the bathroom to take off my makeup; that's probably the worst part — not to mention that I skipped dinner to avoid being too full for a hookup that didn't happen.

"9 a.m. — Finally roll out of bed, last night was a long night with little sleep but I want to get to the gym before my eyelash appointment. 10 a.m. — Workout done! I biked for 30 minutes and called it a day since I have to be across town by 10:45. When I moved, I was excited to have a gym where I lived but honestly, it isn't that great. I munch on a Clif bar while I get ready — our kitchen light is finicky in the morning and I just can't be bothered with it today. 10:45 a.m. — I have very blond, long, and thick eyelashes so I get them tinted every six to eight weeks. It is what keeps me going in life! It is my favorite thing I do and I get the student discount ($15) but always tip based on the original price — $20. My lady is the best and makes it comfortable for my sensitive eyes. I also pay for street parking ($0.25). $20.25 11 a.m. — Post-eyelash appointment, I realize how hungry I am and swing by a smoothie shop on my way home. It's pricey but good. I have had a long week, and today is my treat yourself day. $9.19 1:30 p.m. — After lying in bed and mindlessly scrolling on the internet, I decide to finally get ready. (I wore pajamas to my eyelash appointment, no shame.) I make myself an egg sandwich with spinach, and arugula with carrots and hummus on the side. I have a work meeting and need to run to the store after work, so I want to make sure I won't be hungry when I finally get home. 5:30 p.m. — It's officially the weekend! The kids were wild today and I am ready to go home. I call my mom to fill her in on my first week and catch up. I love being off on my own but I wish I could see her more. 8 p.m. — Roommate and her BF head to the liquor store for mojito supplies. I take this opportunity to eat. I made a promise to never drink on any empty stomach after some bad freshman year experiences. I eat a cheese quesadilla with my favorite Whole Foods salsa. It's not a lot, but I get the drunchies really bad and want to eat healthier while I'm thinking about it. 9 p.m. — We decide to go to a trashy college bar that won't break the bank. I'm still bummed about being turned down last night and plan on looking hot tonight — with the help of my roommate's more scandalous wardrobe. 2 a.m. — The night was a fail. The bar didn't work out, the party got busted, and we had to pee so we just went home. My roommates and a friend continue drinking while catching up on and that's more than okay with me at this point. My roommate and I each paid for an Uber. $5.75 4 a.m. — Off to bed we go. Daily Total: $35.19",3,236
"11:45 a.m. — I wake up hangover free and fairly refreshed. My roommate's BF has a friend in town this weekend and due to the crazy cold temps recently, a lake near us has frozen and we are going hiking up to it this afternoon. When I was home in Minnesota for Christmas, it was far too cold to hang out outside so I'm excited for the trip. I make plans to do laundry with a friend and start hydrating. 4 p.m. — After lying in bed and falling asleep on and off, we leave for our hike. It's gorgeous outside but there's no snow or ice. Our group of four turned into seven; I have fun meeting new people and enjoying the company people I already knew. I love hiking and wish I did it more often, especially since I have thousands of miles of trail in my backyard. 5:30 p.m. — We are all hungry and decide on a fun burger place located between the hiking spot and where we live. The service is slow, but the food and company make the trip worth it. I gave up meat in August and order my first falafel burger ($8). I'm in love. My roommate and I split seasoned fries and we all try $1 beers. We split the bill and I pay my roommate $5 for the fries and rum she bought us last night. $13 8 p.m. — Since it's Saturday, we invite friends over for drinks and a small pregame. We stop at Walmart to pick up essentials like oranges, maraschino cherries, beer, and wine. I'm excited to invite my first friend over to my new place because that really makes it feel like your own. I will be reimbursed for the beer ($12) later on since it's for a friend. $23.67 10:30 p.m. — Roommate's boyfriend (who is hosting the party) says it's a good time to come over. She calls an Uber and we take our final shots, shotguns, and drinks. We are ready! The party is being hosted in a house with brothers from one frat but it's not a frat party, so there's an excellent mix of people and a really good guy-to-girl ratio. My friend A. is nervous he won't get in, but my roommate and I know he won't have a problem because we know the hosts well. 12 a.m. — The party keeps growing and I'm having a blast. I switched to beers from liquor and I am feeling it. All of the people I know well are passing around drinks for others to try and I'm tasting a little bit of everything. Since there are more guys now, I stick close to A. The crowd is getting really grabby and I want a safety person. He does a great job making sure I am okay, which I am beyond thankful for. 2:30 a.m. —  My stomach is mad at me after downing a quarter of a bottle of wine with my roommate's boyfriend. I originally wanted to bring wine with me but we all decided that was a bad idea and now I know why. One second, I am dancing to the piano music with A., my roommate, and her BF, and the next I am dragging A. to the bathroom with me so I can puke. After ordering two Ubers, I make it home.

"12 p.m. — I wake up, shower and confirm a time to do laundry with a friend. We don't have a washer currently, so I am going to campus to do mine for free through the dorms. I am also super hungover. 1:30 p.m. — Finally leave the house and stop at a gas station to buy a lemon-lime Powerade. $2.22 5 p.m. — After doing laundry, I take pics of my friend for her art class and she makes dinner. We eat rice with salad and it is delicious — and almost cures my hangover. 12 a.m. — After getting back from laundry, I spend the rest of the day in my room watching Netflix and finally pass out at midnight. Daily Total: $2.22",5,236
"11 a.m. — It's MLK Jr. Day, which means no classes or work. I take today to sleep in. When I wake up, I make avocado toast with a fried egg for breakfast. Then I spend the rest of the morning setting up my schedule for the week. 3 p.m. — It's a slow-moving day. I try to start my work for the week but it's not keeping my attention so I watch a few episodes of before getting ready for the day. It's supposed to snow tomorrow, so anything I want to get done needs to be done today. I have been on the lookout for a light winter coat and black jeans. I check out two stores today with zero success. 4 p.m. — Just found out school is canceled tomorrow and I don't have to work. That means the rest of today will consist of Netflix and sleeping. 5 p.m. — I haven't eaten since breakfast. I use the rest of my avocado with a little bit of lemon juice, garlic powder, nutritional yeast, salt, and pepper to make a sauce for my noodles. It's okay. I eat with my roommates while we catch up on . 11 p.m. — Roommates and I are not feeling well and call it a night. One sounds like she has the flu coming on. I am thankful I am probably just tired from the weekend. Daily Total: $0",6,236
"10:30 a.m. — It's a snow day — with no snow! It's nice to sleep in, though. Right after I wake up my boss texts about another potential school closure tomorrow. I could get use to this. I spend my lazy morning texting my dad. Last semester was really tough for me and I talked to my parents daily; this semester I have only talked to them twice so far and it's nice to catch up. 11:30 a.m. — While eating breakfast, I do some online shopping and find a cute pair of reasonably priced black jeans and a shirt. The website is having a 20% off sale but that essentially covers shipping. I go through with it anyway because I am struggling to find jeans and have heard good things about the site. I can't believe I paid that much for them. I really wanted to get them secondhand, but also I'm desperate. $40.40 2 p.m. — It's finally snowing! I pull myself out of bed for peanut butter toast and . We spend the rest of the afternoon binge-watching and helping the dog adjust to the snow that is sticking and praying for another snow day. 6:30 p.m. — K-12 schools got canceled, which means work is canceled for me. Classes are still on but I have high hopes for them to be out, too. We take a break from our marathon to make dinner: quinoa fried rice with all the veggies in my fridge and frozen spring rolls. 7 p.m. — My only class tomorrow is canceled! I'm pumped because that means I have no classes this week. This calls for a celebration! I pop open a bottle of wine as the marathon continues. 9 p.m. — Roommate and I realize that the Women's March is this weekend and we make plans to go. We both participated last year and are very excited to participate again. I hang out, thinking about the fact that if the roads really do get icy tomorrow, I will go crazy after being in the house for two days straight. 10:30 p.m. — Roommate and I venture out for fast food and are very disappointed to find out everything is closed. Ice in the South sucks. Daily Total: $40.40",7,236
"8:45 a.m. — I get to sleep in today because it's New Year's Day! I stumble out of bed after lying there for about an hour to get coffee at Starbucks, but I forgot that most places are closed on New Year's Day. I go to three different Starbucks until I found one that is open and get my coffee. $3.80 10:30 a.m. — Back at home. Time to take down the Christmas tree (the saddest time of the year) and clean of the apartment. Rent is due, so I do some math to figure out what it comes out to after utilities. It seems lower than normal — $968.20 — but I later learn that my boyfriend accidentally paid for my share of the parking. I will pay the difference next month. 12:15 p.m. — I wanted to use my Target gift card from Christmas to get a lamp we badly need for our dining area. I forgot my eyebrow liner at my parents' house when I visited over the holidays, so I get that, too. I still have about $6 on my gift card after checking out. 1:30 p.m. — I want Panera bread for lunch, but it's closed. My boyfriend and I go to Met Market and I get fried chicken and fries with aioli sauce, feeling a little guilty for continuing my holiday indulgences. I also pick up a pre-made baked potato because we are having steak for dinner and I forgot to buy potatoes at the store the other day. I find pine nut hummus for the week's lunches to go with mini-cucumbers I got at Costco. $22.59 2:10 p.m. — We go back home to eat and watch the marathon that's on. Then, we watch the new season of . Later, I remember that I need to make a few edits to a deck for work, which takes about an hour. After, I take some time to make my monthly budget. My credit card bill is adding up and it hurts! 6:45 p.m. — My BF makes steak. I'm still super full from the chicken and fries, and wind up not eating dinner. We finish our day going back and forth between and . I'm scheduled to work from home tomorrow, but feel like I should go in. Daily Total: $26.39",1,237
"5:45 a.m. — I finally wake up after hitting snooze for an hour. I wanted an extra day to take it easy and work for home, but I still get up early to freshen up and get coffee at Starbucks. The sunrise today is beyond words. I rush to get ready so I can catch it and take a cool picture. I'm short a few cents to get a venti Americano with a pump of toasted white mocha, so I add $10 to my Starbucks app. (My coffee is $3.80.) I need to hurry if I want to catch this sunrise, so I head over to Kerry Park to take a few pics of the Seattle skyline. Bonus: the mountain is visible! In  early December, I decided to create a new Pacific Northwest travel and food Instagram account. I need to make sure I'm adding content. $10 8:20 a.m. — Back at home, I make myself toast, eggs, and eat an applesauce packets before getting back to work. 1:30 p.m. — I'm still full from breakfast so I don't eat anything for lunch. Instead, I catch up on what Anna Faris is doing via her new book, . Two hours later, I go for a workout in the apartment gym and watch the last episode of . 4:30 p.m. — Back at the apartment, I check on emails for work until it's time for dinner and a shower because I'm a sweaty mess. For dinner, I make turkey taco meat for my BF. There is leftover steak in the fridge and I decide to eat that with nachos (just tortilla chips and cheese) and a side of guac. It's delicious. We watch more and I grab an ice cream sandwich from the freezer. 8 p.m. — has sucked enough of my soul. I need a coffee maker to help save money (hopefully), so I buy a Keurig with the Amazon gift card I have ($36.97). I also add a holder for the K-cups ($11.20) and the book I want ($18.71). ""STOP SPENDING MONEY!"" I tell myself — but it is Christmas money. Daily Total: $10",2,237
"6 a.m. — I snooze for an hour until I actually have to wake up. (I question why I even set such an early alarm if I don't wake up for it.) Because I showered the night before, I only need to dry shampoo, wash my face, and put on makeup. I grab oatmeal and raspberries for breakfast and throw together leftover ground turkey and fat-free refried pinto beans in a Pyrex with a pre-packed cup of guac and an applesauce pouch for lunch. 6:50 a.m. — I'm out the door and off to work. I tell myself I don't need to go to Starbucks because there is a coffee machine at work; I need to stick to the budget I made for myself! Work is about 20 minutes away, east of Seattle, and I try to get there early enough to beat traffic. I settle into work, get a coffee, and eat breakfast. 8 a.m. — The day is still going and I grab another cup of coffee. 9 a.m. — Need…more…coffee. I usually stick to one cup so this is not normal for me. I am seriously struggling to get back into a work routine. 10:30 a.m. — My group of gal friends are blowing up my group text about going to Disneyland in March. We finally set on a date and plane tickets. Luckily for me, I got a gift card to Alaska Air for Christmas and can use it toward this trip! The plane ticket is $166.60 and I still have $133.40 to put toward a trip later this year! 12:55 p.m. — I finally am hungry for lunch. It's boring because the taco/bean/guac combo is my go-to when I'm in a hurry, but it gets boring. I think beans hurt my stomach, so I don't know why I keep putting that pain on myself. I am scheduled to be at work until 5 p.m. rather than my normal 3 p.m. today, so I need to talk a little walk. That turns into me grabbing a small mocha at the café. $4.95 3:20 p.m. — My BF texted to say he's going to the gym after work and won't be home for dinner. I text my best friend to see if she wants dinner. We decide on a pasta restaurant at 6 p.m. It's a date! 5:30 p.m. — My meeting ran half an hour late, so I call the restaurant and my friend to change the time to 6:30. Leaving at this time usually means I'll hit the worst traffic ever, but I think people are still on vacation because I get to the restaurant way earlier than anticipated. I pay to park ($6) and, since I'm early, decide to get a drink at the bar. It's still happy hour! I get the house amaro and it's my first time having it; it's sweet but bitter and smoky. Interesting. For dinner, I order the pappardelle. We split a bruschetta with smoked salmon for an app. NOMS. We split the bill and I pay with Christmas cash — $45 even. $51 8:15 p.m. — Back at home, I wash my face and get into my sweat suit. My apartment is cold and I don't want to spend money on any more heat than we need. I cozy up and dig into more of Anna Faris' life. I should hopefully be done with this book soon! Daily Total: $55.95",3,237
"5:45 a.m. — I need to be at work on time because I have to leave promptly at 3 p.m. I grab my oatmeal and raspberries and find more leftover steak from Monday, three mini-cucumbers, a scoop of hummus, and another applesauce pouch. (This one has banana in it!) At work, I head straight to the coffee machine and then to my desk to do more work (and maybe some Instagram and Facebook scrolling). 8:15 a.m. — Last cup of coffee ... maybe. While I wait for my coffee to brew, I realize I need to pay off some of my credit cards. I put $200 to each credit card. I need to get these paid off soon. I cringe every time I look at the balance I owe. $400 9:45 a.m. — My oatmeal with raspberries is staring at me. It's time to eat. 1:15 p.m. — I have my lunch. The steak is actually pretty good and not too dried out from the microwave which is a win in my book! 3 p.m. — I leave work for a dermatologist appointment. I have a $15 copay and luckily don't need any meds or anything else. I go home after and veg out, watching TV until dinner (the baked potato I bought from Met Market on Monday). It was alright but I might be hungry later. $15 7 p.m. — I take a shower because tomorrow is Friday and I know I will probably sleep in. After, I do some scrolling on Instagram and get back to Anna Faris. My boyfriend returns from a workout and I internally shame myself for not doing the same. (Maybe I'll go TOMORROW! Or Saturday. Or Sunday?) Anyway, time for bed. We go to bed super early, around 9 or 9:30 p.m. Daily Total: $415",4,237
"6:15 a.m. — My alarm didn't go off. Awesome. I jump out of bed and get ready. My morning routine with hair styling and no shower is almost down to 15 minutes. I pat myself on the back for showering the night before and declare dry shampooing a big win. I get to work at a decent time and realize I have a free coffee on my punch card for the café at work! I opt for a large Americano with one pump of white mocha and cream. I didn't pack anything this morning for breakfast or lunch, so I also get a scone. $2.75 11:45 a.m. — Hungry, I go to our common area to get lunch. I need to get away from my desk. It's been slow this entire week. (I'm complaining even though I've only been in the office for three days.) There are so many changes happening in our organization so it's been a waiting game these day. Our common area has everything from pizza to burgers, sushi, ramen, buffet food. The world is our oyster! (IDK if they have oysters though.) I'm in the mood for sushi so I get a combo with an eel roll, salmon nigiri, and a cup of edamame. Luckily, the line is short today. I get my food quick and find a spot to sit and scroll online until I go back to my desk to work until my day is done. $12.50 3 p.m. — I leave work at normal time and head over to Bellevue for happy hour with my boyfriend's flag football team to celebrate the end of their season. I filled in a few games so I'm invited. His company is paying for the happy hour! I'm a little early to the party. The happy hour is connected to the Bellevue Square Mall, so I decide to do some window shopping. I repeat in my head, ... Fortunately, I follow my silent commands. I get to happy hour and order a Moscow Mule and pretzel. The rest of the table orders beers, nachos, fried pickles, and chicken wraps. 8:15 p.m. — The happy hour is over and I go to the store. In anticipation of my Keurig, I get creamer, K-cups, and breakfast stuff ($26.92). After that, I go to Molly Moon's; their January flavors are out so I get a pint for the week ($9.50). Delicious. $36.42 9 p.m. — Back at the apartment and my Keurig is here! I set it up and then get a scoop of ice cream and settle in for the rest of the night. Daily Total: $51.67",5,237
"8:45 a.m. — Wow, I really slept in. I have nowhere to be so I lay in bed for a bit. It's a rainy day here in Seattle and also a perfect time to use my new Keurig. I go for the Donut Shop brand K-cup and add vanilla-caramel creamer. I'm pretty happy. I go online and work for about an hour because I wasn't very productive this week and I forgot to do something important. Oops. 10:45 a.m. — While thinking about my upcoming trip to Disneyland, I notice we'll have to take a shuttle from LAX to Anaheim. I look up shuttles and book the cheapest one for our group at $172 roundtrip. Since people will pay me back, that will be $34.40 out of pocket per person — not too shabby. $34.40 11:30 a.m. — I go get ready for the day because my boyfriend's parents and brother are in town. His brother is going back to school so we all meet up for a going-away lunch at Duke's Chowder House. I order the blackened salmon Caesar with an iced tea. We say our goodbyes and go back to the apartment. 3:30 p.m. — For Christmas, my boyfriend got me a punch card to go rock climbing, so we go get our climb on. It's been a little over a month since I've last climbed and I am rusty. I am not an avid climber and stick to the 5.7s the whole time. I am not great with holds — and not nearly as strong as I used to be. I used to be really into weightlifting but I've taken a hiatus for the last seven months or so. I'm noticing a theme, and it's that I need to get back to the gym. 5:15 p.m. — We finish rock climbing and go back to the apartment to shower. We decide on a BBQ spot for dinner to get food to-go and my boyfriend pays. I get a chicken sandwich and jo jo potatoes. It's Netflix and chill for the rest of the night. Daily Total: $34.40",6,237
"8 a.m. — I finally get out of bed and make coffee with my new Keurig. Only two days in and it is already a great investment! Some friends are coming over today to watch the Golden Globes and our apartment is a mess, so I do a deep clean. It's much more stressful thinking about it than doing it. 10:45 a.m. — Finished cleaning! I make myself a breakfast sandwich with bacon and eggs on seven-grain bread, then get ready so we can go to the grocery store. I allot for $50 for my portion but I'm hoping I can just use the cash in my wallet ($46). We split the bill and it's only $15.06. Big win — not only am I under budget but I have money to spare for pizza tonight! $15.06 12:05 p.m. — Back at home, I finish the rest of Anna Faris' book. Finally! My stomach starts to grumble so I eat a snack of apples and peanut butter. 4:15 p.m. — My friends are here and I order a large pizza and a side of cinnamon sticks. I pay with a coupon deal and tip. Since my friends brought other snacks, we don't split the bill. There is leftover pizza too, so there's lunch for me tomorrow! (And I'm still technically under-budget for my $50 grocery allotment.) $32.37 5 p.m. — We sit back with our pizza and cringe at all the awkwardness coming our way for three hours. From Tommy Wiseau to Frances McDormand, everything is straight up confusing. We do, however, get to watch the glorious goddess that is Oprah do her thing. 8:30 p.m. — My friends leave for the night and I clean up and get ready for bed. I'm exhausted and my throat is feeling scratchy. I better not be getting sick... I get to sleep by 9:30 and all is well in the world. Daily Total: $47.43",7,237
"8 a.m. — I wake up a few minutes later than normal, step out of bed and realize something is wrong. My calf feels like it's about to seize up into a Charlie horse and I brace for it, but the pain continues with every step I take. I put it to the back of my mind and make myself an egg, turkey sausage, and flatbread sandwich. Said flatbread gets stuck in the toaster and I try to free it for minutes without electrocuting myself. There are crumbs EVERYWHERE. I drink leftover coffee from the fridge, pretending it's cold brew. 9 a.m. — I walk to and from campus every day. It saves me almost $1,000/year in parking fees and allows me to get steps in. I've lived in two cities on the East Coast and I missed walking. When I moved back to Ohio, I made sure to live close enough to work to walk. Like many Midwestern cities and towns, you can drive and park almost anywhere so you need to make it a priority to walk. 1:07 p.m. — I'm late! Because I'm working alone today, I got engrossed in my work and forget to leave on time to meet my best friend for lunch. I walk to the restaurant but it's permanently closed! She picks me up and we go to another location nearby. I get a CYO poke-style bowl with brown rice, kale, tuna, avocado, carrots, cucumber, pineapple, sesame seed, green onion, spicy mayo, and sweet soy sauce. It's huge but we both inhale our bowls. It's nice seeing her midday and she drops me back at my office. $12 3:30 p.m. — My friends are having a white elephant gift exchange next weekend and I'm slowly compiling my gift: a DIY Moscow mule set. I already have the ginger beer and mixers, but my copper mugs arrive too. Another delivery man stops by, and he has the Ancestry DNA kit I ordered for my S.O.'s birthday. It's not until March, but the sale at Christmas was too good to pass up, so I'll stash it away until it's time. He knows little about the ethnic makeup of half of his family and has mentioned wanting to find out. I think it'll be a great 30th birthday present. 6 p.m. — After I walk home from work, I drop my stuff off, grab my grocery bags, and walk to Kroger. My S.O. has finals this week and requested good old fashioned brain food. I pick up avocados, spinach, sweet potatoes, mushrooms, broccoli, brussels sprouts, a stir fry veggie kit, wheat bread, ground beef, breakfast sausage, whole wheat egg noodles, beef broth, sour cream, two Amy's bowls for my lunches, a box of brownie mix, and Reese's Pieces. $45.33 7:50 p.m. — I immediately launch into cooking mode. I make one-pot beef stroganoff with spinach, mix the brownies and bake them, and prep a sausage, egg, and cheese tater tot casserole for my S.O. to eat in the mornings before finals. Growing up, my mom always made hot breakfast during standardized testing weeks, and I feel morally obligated to treat him to the same (even if I'm not home). We eat stroganoff together and watch an episode of . 10:30 p.m. — I clean up the kitchen, ice the brownies and cover them with Reese's, shower, and climb into bed to read a book from the library. (It's kind of depressing and I look forward to finishing it tomorrow.) I say goodnight to my S.O. and leave him to his studies. Daily Total: $57.33",1,238
"7 a.m. — I'm tossing and turning from 7 a.m. onward. My nose has been permanently plugged for months on just one side as I sleep. I wish I knew how to make it stop because I obsess over the feeling and lose precious ZZZs over it. I finally get up and my calf is still screaming at me, so I reluctantly cancel my barre class. I got an unlimited month as a Black Friday special and hate to waste it. I make avocado toast with TJ's Everything but the Bagel seasoning and drink more leftover cold coffee. 9 a.m. — Everyone is back to work today. I get to work and catch up on a few things. I also see that visa procedures for Brazil are changing starting January 25. This is amazing! One visa can cost up to $300 with fees, and this would cost a mere $40 — a huge savings for students, faculty and staff traveling there. I inform my colleagues and they are similarly thrilled. (Nothing like new immigration rules to rile us up.) 1 p.m. — We go out to one of my favorite breakfast/brunch spots for a coworker's birthday. I order a pumpkin pancake, a side of bacon, and a fountain Diet Dr. Pepper. They accidentally give me a whole order of pancakes so my colleagues happily help finish everything. My indulgent lunch means I only eat a sliver of Reese's Pieces brownies upon my return to the office, but my colleagues dig in to the birthday treat. $11.38 4 p.m. — Aww. One of my closest friends from grad school sent me an email with a life update. She lives in Germany, and although English is her second language, her emails are always pure poetry. I'm so happy to see her doing well and I make a mental note to write her back later. 4:30 p.m. — On the work side of things, my boss pulls me into his office and tells me that I probably need to go to China for an academic program in a few months. It'll be my third time there, and each time I go with a different set of students. I wish I could give other colleagues a chance to go, but alas, this falls under my purview. I'm already starting to get excited; it's a great professional development opportunity and I get to work with students. 5:30 p.m. — After walking home, I roast brussels sprouts and drizzle them with balsamic vinegar. I find my heating pad, warm it up, and then put my calf on it while I eat a bowl of veggies and finish my book from last night. It's a rather realistic portrayal of divorce, which is probably why I don't love it — too depressing. 6:30 p.m. — A friend from my D.C. days sends me a text out of the blue and it's amazing to hear from her. I tell her that I'm about to run an errand and that if she'd like, I can call her while I do so. She actually agrees (I didn't want to ruin her free time if she just wanted to relax with wine), and so I quickly grab my coat and get in my freezing cold car. We chat as I drive to Old Navy, and while I intended to go into the store still talking to her, I stay in the warm car with my seat warmers. We make tentative arrangements for me to visit or for her to come to Ohio in the spring. 7:15 p.m. — It's the last day to use Old Navy cash rewards, so I decide to get my work wife a set of cactus thermal pajamas. Hopefully, she'll love her set as much as I love mine. $17.72 7:30 p.m. — I head to the pharmacy next to pick up my ring. There's no charge and I'm in an out within five minutes. I head out to pick up my S.O. from school; they finished class a bit early and it is freezing outside. 8:15 p.m. — We grab leftover beef stroganoff and spinach from the fridge and eat on the couch while watching more . 9:30 p.m. — I've relaxed too long and need to shower. When I get in, I remember that I have a podiatry appointment tomorrow and I feel incredibly vain even saying this, but these toes of mine need help. I quickly shave my legs, making sure not to miss the spots on my ankles (and feet and toes). I tell myself they'll appreciate the effort, even if my polish is all sorts of chipped. 10:30 p.m. — My S.O. and I read in bed together until I turn out the light. He's hungry again, so he leaves me in peace while I fall asleep. Daily Total: $29.10",2,238
"8:15 a.m. — I get to sleep in even more today. I have more avocado toast and cold coffee for breakfast, and I unload the dishwasher and wash up the knives and pans in the sink. While doing my makeup, I watch a few YouTube videos and finally get dressed in something warm. 9:35 a.m. — My car is finally warmed through after my 20-minute drive to the doctor, but at least I got to listen to indie holiday radio the whole way there. I don't have to wait long to go back, and one of the residents comes in quickly. Why are all the podiatrists here so good looking? I broke my toe back in July and as of October, it was still broken. I've been avoiding any strenuous workouts and waiting for it to heal, but it's still painful sometimes. We do another X-ray and see that while it has healed (yay!), there's scar tissue that may just be forcing my joint off track. My only fear was making it worse, so now that I know it's healed, I'm free to go back to my cardio classes and work through the pain, which should lessen over time. I'll have a co-pay and a fee for the X-ray, but probably won't see it until next year and I'll use my FSA to cover it. 11:15 a.m. — I clipped Arby's coupons last week knowing that my doctor's office was nearby. I get a sandwich via the drive-through and head home. $2.82 12:30 p.m. — I get home, eat my sandwich, warm up my S.O.'s brussels sprouts for him and green beans for myself. It's nice to see him midday but I walk back to work and grab my work wife broccoli cheddar soup in the student cafeteria on the way. We don't keep track of who buys what because we spend way too much time together and that would be obnoxious. $4 1:15 p.m. — Another Christmas package arrived! I wanted to get my S.O. something small but useful for Christmas. His Chucks are destroyed; there are holes everywhere and I know he'd like to replace them but can't justify the funds. After I checked his size, I bought a new pair on-sale during Cyber Monday. I'll put them in a box with the NASA socks I always get him. (He's the best kind of nerd.) 4 p.m. — I've been working on a guidance document and in doing my research, I came across the word ""updation."" Working with other countries and cultures, you realize that the English language can be adapted in unique ways. I'm pretty sure this is a combination of the words ""update"" and ""validation,"" but Google tells me it may simply mean ""updating,"" though it's not a recognized word in the Oxford dictionary. I need to keep a running list of words like this. 5:30 p.m. — A few coworkers and I meet up for wine and whine after work. I use the brisk, 30-minute walk to call my mom and enjoy a blonde coffee ale with my friends. It's a small group, and it's interesting to hear about their jobs; even though we're in the same department, we all have vastly different roles. We munch on free popcorn and my happy hour beer is $3 before I tip. $4 7:45 p.m. — I take a warm shower as soon as I get home before warming up even more beef stroganoff and eating an apple with peanut butter. My boyfriend joins me in the living room and we get sucked into four episodes of . I'm watching it for the first time and I need to get ready for bed and dry my hair, but my S.O. is loving the time together and convinces me to stay on the couch with him. He says he loves how much the show makes me laugh, which makes me mushy. 10 p.m. — I roughly dry my hair and I look like a lion. I usually style it at night too, but I don't tonight and my S.O. delights in the fluffy nature of my hair. I work on a samurai Sudoku in bed before turning out my light for the night. Daily Total: $10.82",3,238
"7:45 a.m. — I switch it up this morning and have HOT coffee with my avocado toast. I text with my best friend about a weird dream I had last night (about her ex) and then watch a few YouTube videos (7-Eleven came out with a make-up line?) while doing my makeup and flat ironing my hair. 9 a.m. — I knew it was going to be cold today, so I went for my fluffiest down coat, a scarf, and a hat. As soon as I step outside, I see that it's the first snow of the season; my eyes water the whole way to work from the cold. I should probably switch to waterproof mascara from here on out. 11:10 a.m. — I can't wait any longer and heat up my lunch of cheddar, noodles, and broccoli — basic but tasty on a cold day. My coworker tries to give me $5 for lunch yesterday, but I waive it off knowing she's providing my dinner tomorrow night. 11:30 a.m. — Occasionally, I check the Ohio Division of Unclaimed Funds to see if there's any money for me. I find nothing, but a quick search of my S.O.'s name reveals an amount greater than $100. When I confirm that it is indeed him, he laughs because it's linked to a job he had at 19 years old. Hopefully, it'll be an easy process because that amount will be helpful for him (and really, it would be for anyone at the holidays). I go through some of my other friends and family, but no else comes up in my searches. 3:30 p.m. — Another package arrives and it's for me! Ulta had crazy Cyber Monday sales and I picked up a NYX brow pencil and setting spray, Eucerin face cream (my face is so dry in this weather), The Body Shop's Ethiopian honey mask (did I mention I'm feeling dry?), Wet n Wild setting powder, and Essence brow gel, mascara, and eyelid primer for under $45. 5 p.m. — I've been uncharacteristically tired all day and I bum a ride home early. I check my temperature when I get back: It's 95.7, but it quickly goes up to normal. I stir fry kale, carrots, brussels sprouts, broccoli, and sugar snap peas with chicken and brown rice, hoping the nutritious food will make me feel better before I'm supposed to take a barre class. There's a fee to cancel, so I'm going no matter what. 7:20 p.m. — I survived barre! In fact, I felt better there than I did all day. That being said, it was a tad too easy at times, which means I was probably doing it all wrong. 8 p.m. — I can feel a migraine coming on and it's making me nauseated. I eat a few bites of food in case it's just my blood sugar, take a quick shower, and take my migraine prescription. My boyfriend kindly made up the guest bed (which is my old bed, and I miss how squishy it is sometimes) because he knows I'm feeling pretty yuck. He sets it up so we can watch on his computer from the bed (it's also his office), and I wrap an ice pack around my temple. After two episodes, I'm still feeling awful and decide to close my eyes and hope I'm better in the morning. Daily Total: $0",4,238
"7:45 a.m. — I'm feeling so much better and I managed to sleep a full nine hours! We're out of bread, so I eat a bowl of Kashi, make coffee, put dishes in the washer, and do my makeup while watching YouTube. I love my new eyebrow pencil and powder, and I decide to get truly crazy and put on a garnet eyeshadow today. I stop at the grocery store on my way into work because I have half an avocado I need to eat, and I can toast it at the office. I also pick up a lemon seltzer because I usually forget to drink water at all unless it's fizzy. I charge both to a Visa gift card we got for signing our apartment lease. 10 a.m. — Guess who forgot her computer at home? It's been two years since I've done this, and thankfully, I have a lovely S.O. who is still at home today because it's finals week. He kindly brings it in while I eat avocado toast and check email on my phone. 10:30 a.m. — We have a department-wide meeting concerning hiring and it's a bit illuminating. It also makes me a bit frustrated: I've studied to become an administrator and I worry that people like me will never get jobs that are filled by older academics — they'll be in an administrative role but I will have had all the experience. I have an Ed.M., and I lament the fact I'll probably have to get a doctorate of some sort, though I refuse to get a Ph.D. 12:40 p.m. — Hunger strikes again. This time, I brought a new yellow curry with jackfruit, red pepper, and eggplant from Trader Joe's. I've never had jackfruit, and although the texture is cool, this whole dish tastes like pure curry sauce. I love curry but I'll stick to the vegetable panang curry next time. 4:15 p.m. — I get out a bit early today after doing a task I've been avoiding for weeks. I feel so much lighter! 6 p.m. — I drive to my coworker's house where we're throwing a craft night, which we do about twice per year. This time, I thought we should make cookie jars that we can give to friends and family for Christmas presents. I brought 24 wide-mouth mason jars and everyone else brought various ingredients for the M&M cookies. We create a little assembly line, eat pizza and buffalo dip, and drink mulled wine. 10:45 p.m. — I get home to an empty apartment, as my S.O. went to see with a friend. I'm really tired and quickly pass out, fully expecting to be woken in an hour when the movie is over. However, I'm well and truly out (according to my Fitbit the next morning), and I sleep soundly. Daily Total: $0",5,238
"10:30 a.m. — I wake up and eat a bowl of Kashi Cinnamon Harvest and drink a big glass of water before going to barre. I run into a colleague and we catch up quickly before I head into a very busy class. Today's feels much harder but I like the instructor. My calf isn't hurting me at all, which is great. 11:20 a.m. — I go to CVS, hoping to find Yes To Coconuts micellar water, but they don't have that particular variation. I give up and see that a new Big Lots opened across the street. Big Lots is a weird guilty pleasure for me; they always have such a bizarre mix of things, but it's infinitely more organized than T.J. Maxx or Marshalls. I go in and come out with an Auntie Anne's pretzel making kit, Hostess hot cocoa and marshmallow mini-donuts, and two ICE sparkling waters for the S.O. $8.45 1 p.m. — It's officially snowing outside! I get home, eat avocado toast, and decide to do a bit of cleaning. My S.O. usually does most of it but as I mentioned before, he's in finals right now and I'd feel kind of lazy not doing my share. We realize that our dishwasher has officially broken, and after I put in a request to have it fixed, we do the dishes together. I then sweep and mop the floors, clean the oven and stove top, vacuum the living room rug, and use the extensions to clean AC vents and corners that collect dust and cobwebs, as well as do two loads of laundry. Perhaps most disgusting of all, I cut out all my hair from the vacuum bristles. Blech! 6 p.m. — After showering, I make dinner: Thai shrimp fried rice combined with cauliflower fried rice to get extra veggies in. It's one of our favorite meals and thankfully takes one pan to make. My S.O. continues studying while I start a new book from the library. Eventually, I convince him to watch a movie with me. I generally dislike movies but he loves them and hasn't seen one of my guilty pleasures, (the Keira Knightly version). We get too tired at the end and have to pause it before going to bed. Daily Total: $8.45",6,238
"9 a.m. — My S.O. is up before I am, and I ask if he wants to join me and two friends from high school for breakfast. He agrees to come along and we bundle up for the short walk to the restaurant. I'm not thrilled will our breakfast joint choice but the others like it. I get eggs, sausage, and a cinnamon-chip pancake that is so painfully sweet I can only eat a third of it. Everyone but me is in school so we spend a lot of time talking about various projects (in three very different fields); the conversation is interesting as always. We all pay separately and walk home on the icy sidewalks. $12.38 11:30 a.m. — We both feel like garbage. My teeth ache from the sweetness of breakfast and I'm desperate for salt, so I eat more avocado toast. I settle onto the couch and read my book while my S.O. takes a nap. 3 p.m. — Usually, I do my grocery shopping on Mondays, but I'd like to get us something for dinner tonight and I won't have much time tomorrow after work. I enlist my S.O. to come with me, as I won't be able to carry all the groceries home myself. I get groceries for the week and also pick up ingredients for the three dinner parties we have next weekend — garlic, apples, mushrooms, avocados, jalapeños, green chilies, burgers, chicken thighs, chorizo, eggs, cream, whole milk, chocolate milk, a shed load of white American cheese for dip, buns, tortilla chips, broccoli cheddar soup, two frozen meals for work, orzo, chicken broth, flour Oreo pudding mix, cool whip, chocolate cake mix, Oreos, EVOO, green beans, club soda, potato salad, and AA batteries. $88.81 5 p.m. — We're hungry early and make Monterey Jack and bacon cheeseburgers on whole wheat buns with steamed broccoli. (S.O. also has potato salad, but I don't do mayo like that.) We finish watching and I paint my toes a deep purple-gray; S.O. thinks they look black. 9:30 p.m. — My S.O. has a bad headache and lies down early. I take a shower, get out my clothes for work tomorrow, and read more of my book. I eventually join him in bed and together we look at the ""aww"" sub-Reddit. It's the best medicine for sleep and makes us smile. Daily Total: $101.19",7,238
"8 a.m. — I invited a new coworker with me to grab coffee from one of my favorite places close to my office. It was great to start a Friday with conversation and an almond latte. Our office services coffee and lattes, but I enjoy going out for coffee a few times a week. $6 12 p.m. — Walk over to a specialty market that has a great salad bar. We typically have a lot of leftovers in our office throughout the week so I can usually count on food, but nothing healthy was left today. $10 6:30 p.m. — I do a quick workout and run over to my favorite poke place to grab a bowl before seeing a movie. Tuna poke bowls are one of my favorite to-go dinners, but the price adds up after I add seaweed salad and avocado. I recently moved to the Bay Area, and I spent my first few weeks her checking out poke bowl places (there are a ). $12 7:30 p.m. — was an interesting movie but I wouldn't see it again. When I told my mom I went, she said she wouldn't see it either because she ""lived through it."" After the movie, I decided to join the theater's movie club. My friends back home make fun of me, but it is a great deal: $8/month for one movie per month. (Tickets are otherwise $15!) You also get additional tickets for $8. $15 Daily Total: $43",1,239
"9:30 a.m. — Heading into San Francisco (approximately 30 miles — about an hour — from me in Silicon Valley). I fill up my tank before driving. I am meeting a friend to go biking today, and it looks like a beautiful day so far! $40 10:30 a.m. — Parking is a disaster where my friend lives. I think I circled the block by her place four or five times before giving up and just driving farther away to find a spot. I walk toward what I think is her street, but realize I'm not by her place at all. I give in, call a Lyft, and pick her up so we can go to Neiman Marcus in Union Square. My friend and I both use Rent the Runway Unlimited's subscription service (and RTR is located on the top floor of Neiman). Since I've moved, I have significantly fewer social and work events to go to, so I generally use it for getting nice work clothes or when I travel. $10 12:30 p.m. — My friend pays for a Lyft over to the Marina/Wharf area where we are picking up rental bikes. We end up grabbing a late lunch at Buena Vista, the home of the original Irish coffee! We share a table with a couple and end up in conversation. One half of the couple is moving here from Seattle in a few months, and she is in town trying to figure out what neighborhood she wants to live in. We have fun exchanging moving to the Bay Area stories. $25 2 p.m. — Bike pickup! Our plan is to ride over the bridge and take the Sausalito ferry back. (Our bike rental includes the ferry fare.) We conquer the last hill before the bridge and think we're in the clear for a nice, non-hilly experience the rest of the way — wrong. There aren't any hills but it is crazy windy! We make it over the bridge after what seems like the longest, coldest, most difficult ride ever, thankful to leave that behind us. The views are great but it is an experience I'm happy to have completed once and not repeat. We bike down to beautiful Sausalito, which is so charming, and find a little market for coffee to warm up. After, we get to the line for the ferry, and it is so insanely long that we decide to take a cab back. We share the car with another couple visiting from Germany, and my friend covers the cost of the car since she'll get a credit for the ferry tickets, and I covered the Lyft earlier. $40 6 p.m. — The car drops us off about a block away from the bike return and we enjoy a last, short ride through the crab-smelling wharf. The return goes great, and I call a Lyft to take us to dinner. My friend is doing a January cleanse — no alcohol, dairy, or gluten — and being the good friend that I am, I pick one of my favorite restaurants, Delarosa, which has amazing pizzas and salads. Friend gets mussels and a salad, and we essentially share a table (divided with a small decoration) with two guys visiting on break from college. They are 18, and my friend gives them suggestions for places young'uns can visit. We finish dinner and I pay; my friend pays me her half on Venmo. We take a Lyft line to my car, and I drop off my friend at her house. I head back to the South Bay and immediately pass out when I get home. $45 Daily Total: $160",2,239
"6 a.m. — I'm an early riser on every day of the week. I wake up, make myself a coffee, and go back to bed. 4 p.m. — After what feels like the laziest day, full of binge-watching , I make it to my gym's Sunday afternoon yoga class. It's definitely not the best yoga class, and it drives me crazy when people show up late. But I enjoy the stretching and time for mental clarity — and that the class is included in my membership! 6 p.m. — Quick trip to Sprouts, which I've recently discovered. I have been a loyal Whole Foods shopper but their parking situation is ridiculous, and it's never difficult to park at Sprouts (and it's closer to my house). I grab a few things for the week and am in and out rather efficiently. $24 Daily Total: $24",3,239
"9 a.m. — We have the day off for Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, so I run to my car dealership to get my tail light replaced. It's been out for a few weeks, but I haven't taken the time to get it fixed. I'm driving into San Francisco again today, so it's time to get it done. $10 10:30 a.m. — It took me a few months to find a good nail place, but I finally found a great salon close to my office. I run in for a quick manicure and pedicure and have a great experience (even though I jammed my thumb the other day and am nervous about them removing the gel from it). Friend in SF texts that she's done with work and ready to play, so I jet home to change, grab a baseball hat, and go into the city. $75 3:30 p.m. — After taking the dog to the beach, we grab a snack from the market. I get a farro, tomato, and mozzarella salad; we're fueling up before yoga. We get back to my friend's house and I realize I'm so full from our ""snack"" that I can't do yoga. Friend agrees, and we decide not to go. A few minutes later, my friend suggests we reconsider so before I know it, we are running downstairs to the yoga studio on the ground floor of her building. The class is . I quickly sign up for a free one-week pass and my friend drops my mat next to a cute shirtless guy. Hey there! $5 6 p.m. — We have an amazing class, and I love the studio. Next, we catch the sunset on her roof, and I look up other studio locations near me. There is one about 25 minutes from my house, and I commit to going again this week. When I leave, I find parking tickets on my car for $75 each! I decide to deal with this later; I thought the meters were off for the holiday. So annoying! I hit up Target to grab a few additional groceries for the week — LaCroix, chicken, spaghetti squash, Annie's cheddar bunnies, and toiletries. $32 Daily Total: $122",4,239
"8:30 a.m. — I typically eat breakfast at work — either a protein shake or a Siggi's yogurt with almonds — as they're pretty generous with free breakfast options. Today is a vanilla shake kind of morning. 12 p.m. — We have a guest speaker at lunch today who is incredible and talks about the criminal justice system. Lunch is catered (as it typically is on Mondays), and we have a great spread with salad and chicken. 5:30 p.m. — I subscribe to Plated, one of the meal subscription services, off and on. I saw them on , really liked their pitch, and decided to try it out. I love trying different recipes, and it has encouraged me to cook more. But I've found the meals get expensive and are high in calories. I make one of my final Plated meals (steak frites), and it ends up being delicious! Daily Total: $0",5,239

This will cover me for three months. $291.37 12:30 p.m. — We have leftovers from yesterday's lunch at the office. I catch up with my coworkers and enjoy getting to know them more. 2:30 p.m. — I run an errand for my boss at Paper Source, and while I'm there, I pick up some cards. I love sending handwritten notes as much as I enjoy receiving them! A friend recently found out she's pregnant, so I find a cute mom-to-be card, a birthday card for my cousin, a card for a friend's birthday (I'm trying to be ahead of things), and a ""miss you card"" for a BFF from home. The cards are pricey but worth it. I hope they'll make the recipients smile! $25 7 p.m. — I trek down to the yoga studio that's closer to me to try a hot power fusion class. It ends up being amazing, and they complete the class in the dark with just candles. I am hooked on the studio and vow to go back tomorrow! I get home and make dinner with some food I have left from my grocery shopping the other day. Daily Total: $316.37",6,239

They take me to a great Japanese restaurant close to our office. We talk work and expense the lunch ($20). 7:30 p.m. — Back to yoga! I am hooked on the evening class; it's a great way to wind down from the day. I have a few days left on my free week but talk to the girls about signing up for the monthly pass. It costs $110 the first month and $189 each additional month. I mull it over and pop by the tea place downstairs to grab a drink for my ride home. I wanted something warm but the tea is iced. Still pretty good despite not being what I expected. $5 Daily Total: $6.50,7,239
"7:25 a.m. — I have a mostly regular morning routine. Each day, I wake up, feed the kitty, and drink coffee while watching TV. Then I do physical therapy exercises (I hurt my back last year, and it led to lots of other problems), get ready, and eat yogurt with homemade granola. I make the granola in huge batches, so it lasts me forever. Unfortunately, I burned the last batch, and I'm kind of regretting my strategy of making a ton at a time. After this, I take the metro to work. 12:30 p.m. — It's an unusually meeting heavy day, so I eat lunch at my desk. Today is tomatillo poblano pork with citrus rice, pickled red onions, and a vinegar slaw. It's my attempt at a more interesting taco bowl. 5 p.m. — I've just started using ClassPass because they had a great intro deal. I have a few days left on the membership, and one class to use up, so I look for last-minute availability and see a barre class at 5:30. I bounce out of work at exactly 5 to get there in time. The barre class is super fun but REALLY hard. Luckily, the instructors are good at paying attention to my form. The last time I tried barre, it aggravated my back. This time, they used all sorts of cushions for the ab exercises and it was much, much better. I leave, still shaking from how hard it was. On the bright side, I feel incredible. 6:30 p.m. — I meet my friends a block away from the barre class for our weekly happy hour before our weekly trivia game; this time we go to a pizza joint. Ravenous after barre, I order a fantastic meatball slider, fried calamari, a glass of sangria, and drink about 10 glasses of water. I'm a bit surprised at how expensive this happy hour is, but the food is definitely worth it. $32.50 8 p.m. — Trivia starts at 8 and I nurse one cider the whole night because happy hour was pricey. We end trivia solidly in the middle of the pack, which we are all pretty happy with. I want to take a Lyft home, but I decide to save money and take the metro instead. Once I get out from underground, I try to call my boyfriend. He is a freelancer and has been working early-morning call times all week. It's almost 11 at this point, so we literally talk for two minutes before he hits the hay. Even so, I'm thrilled to hear his voice. We normally hang out almost every night (except for my trivia night because it's very important for me to have friend time), and I'm missing him this week. Once I get home, I cuddle with the cat and watch to wind down. The show is friggin' hilarious, so it's not exactly relaxing, but around midnight, I'm finally able to fall asleep. $8 Daily Total: $40.50",1,240
"7:25 a.m. — I wake up super groggy because I think I woke up a lot during the night. Once awake, I do my typical morning routine and go to work. 10:30 a.m. — I eat clementines at my desk and feel like I need caffeine too. Earlier in the week, I brought in a few bags of a new pomegranate, raspberry, and strawberry green tea. Excited, I make a cup and talk about how great it is to both of my coworkers as we wait for a call to start. As hardcore coffee drinkers, they both look confused that someone could be so excited about tea. Nevertheless, we have a very productive call and all leave it in a good mood. 11:30 a.m. — I'm so hungry I can't wait until the normal time to eat lunch, so I eat more of the tomatillo poblano pork rice bowls. After lunch, I am still starving and try to think of a snack supplement. I see that my favorite dessert food truck is in the area and go with a coworker. She asks me to buy her pie, so I'm guessing money is tight for her. I oblige and buy three slices, one for me, one to take back for my boyfriend (this is also his favorite pie shop), and one for my coworker. After I've already paid, I realize that the food truck guy looks like death (sweating, coughing, mentions he's closing the truck despite a long line), and probably has the flu. Since I'm a super hypochondriac, I decide not to risk eating the pie. However, because my boyfriend is fearless, he happily volunteers to eat both pieces so they won't go to waste. I'm super annoyed I spent so much money on snacks and am still hungry. $22 2:30 p.m. — After a few hours of conference calls, I'm still starving. I go down to the mini-mart in my building to get popcorn. When I get back on the elevator, a sweet elderly gentleman tells me he likes my shoes. I'm sure he's just making conversation, but it's nice to get a compliment. I make a mental note to compliment random folks more often. Half an hour later, I'm hungry. I remember that one of my coworkers (who usually works remotely) keeps Luna bars stocked in her desk for random times like this and makes it known that we are welcome to take one. I take her up on the offer thanking goodness that she is so thoughtful. $1.67 5 p.m. — I have time to kill before my book club (which is just me and two friends who have similar taste in books) meets for dinner. After work, I browse H&M, Gap, and Loft. I don't see anything of interest, so I go to the restaurant about 30 minutes early and luckily they can seat me. I order a sour cider (holy shit it's good!) and wait for my friends to arrive. I order crab-and-corn hushpuppies to share and a personal pizza for dinner. Since I'm still craving pie, I order the key lime pie for dessert. It's actually the size of a small pie and not a slice, so I take most of it home. Dinner takes an hour longer than I thought due to a very slow waitress, but I still metro home instead of Ubering. When I get there, my boyfriend comes over for the first time this week. We are both beat, so we watch and go to bed. $54.20 Daily Total: $77.87",2,240
"9 a.m. — At 9, I wake up, drink coffee, eat a yogurt, and go to the Kennedy Center for free Saturday yoga. The class isn't particularly hard but since I'm getting back in shape after my back injury, it's nice to go slow and focus on form. 11:30 a.m. — I rush back home to take my cat to the vet. I quickly heat up an Indian food TV dinner from Trader Joe's. Then, I spend the next 15 minutes chasing her around the house. Every time I get her and put her in her cage, she manages to get out of my grip. Once I've finally gotten her in the cage and the car, the cat is not happy and won't stop meowing. Still, kitty and I must have the same taste in men because the second the very attractive vet walks in, she stops meowing and starts hamming it up, rolling around on the examining room table. I, on the other hand, get nervous. A good-looking dude who is good with my cat? Swoon. With my cat behaving, the vet can give me good news: She is totally healthy and her pooping on the floor (why I brought her in) is likely behavioral. She's also lost an impressive amount of weight since I first started fostering her. (She's an elderly kitty and after three months of fostering — and not a single person coming to see her — I fell in love and adopted her). $71.50 1:30 p.m. — I give the cat a ton of treats at home in the hopes that she'll start associating vet visits with treats. Then I take a long shower and watch a bit of while eating the rest of yesterday's key lime pie. By 2:30, the BF comes over and brings with him a spur-of-the-moment McNuggets meal, which he and I split. We usually don't eat fast food, but I'm glad he got it since the TV dinner was not particularly filling. 3:30 p.m. — After eating, we rush to the metro to catch the ""Murder Is Her Hobby"" exhibition at the Renwick Gallery; it's basically miniature houses of crime scenes used for police training. When we get there, the line is out the door. We eventually get in, and it's super cool. Unfortunately, as I go to take a picture, I realize I don't have my phone. I momentarily worry that I lost it, but my boyfriend sends a Facebook message to my roommate, who lets me know I left it at home. I hate to be one of those people who feels naked without her phone, but I totally do. 6 p.m. — My boyfriend worked on a project that is debuting tonight. To celebrate, all his colleagues are meeting for drinks at a bar. Although I have a friend's birthday event that night, I stop by for a bit to support everyone and say hi. Luckily, I genuinely like all my boyfriend's friends. I get two drinks and split chicken wings with the BF. He pays. 7:30 p.m. — I take the metro home to get my phone before going to my friend's birthday event. It's a good thing I went to get my phone: the original location, a bar with board games, was way too packed, so she moved the party to a nearby burger place. It's not far but metro is slow and I'm already running late. I take an Uber there ($6.30). At the burger place, I order a sour beer, and what turns out to be a gigantic bowl of fries. (I figured it was a small side.) I also get a piece of cake for the birthday girl because everyone else got her drinks already ($27.60). Since none of my friend's friends know each other and my friend is a new momma, we all leave fairly early. I Uber home ($5.48). $39.38 Daily Total: $110.88",3,240
"9 a.m. — I wake up and drink coffee while I finish watching . When I'm done, my little brother calls, and we catch up for the next hour. We are very close but since he works a lot, we don't get to talk as often as we'd like. After the call, I go to make breakfast, only to realize I have literally no food in my fridge — just milk and the flu pie. I dig through the freezer and heat up a few veggie samosas from Trader Joe's. After eating, I go back to watching TV and cuddle with the kitty. She's abnormally cuddly today, and I'm loving it. When the BF texts me that he has woken up, it takes me an extra half an hour to get to his place because I can't bear to disturb kitty's resting place. 12:30 p.m. — Once I get to my boyfriend's, he gives me a smoothie, and we read Date Lab. It's our tradition to read and then guess how the daters rated each other, and if they'll go out again. Since we missed last week's, we have two this week! As per usual, I nailed my guesses. An hour later, I'm so hungry I feel nauseous. My boyfriend also has no food at his house, so we go out to a diner that just opened. I order a traditional breakfast (turkey bacon, pancakes, hash browns and toast) and he gets hot dogs. I cover the tab and leave a nice tip because our server was so sweet and the bill was so small. $25.70 3:30 p.m. — After lunch, we go back to my boyfriend's place and watch . Then I head home so I can cook for the week. I go grocery shopping and am clearly craving veggies. I buy salad mix, green beans, onions, broccoli, hummus, a piece of cake (I still have a sweet tooth), yogurt, milk, clementines, blueberries, and a few frozen meals. When I get back, I eat a giant salad for dinner and the cake for good measure. I half-ass the meal prep I planned on doing because I'm not in the mood. I marinate a flank steak in a white balsamic vinaigrette, brine pork chops, steam green beans, and pop a few frozen salmon filets into the oven. I decide to finish cooking tomorrow and spend the rest of the night watching TV. $98.69 Daily Total: $124.39",4,240
"7:25 a.m. — Normal morning routine and then metro to work. Throughout the morning I snack on orange slices and clementines. 12 p.m. — At noon, I head across the street to my weekly physical therapy appointment. My physical therapist is around my age, and we wind up chatting the whole session, so it's actually enjoyable. The session is $100, but I put it on the HRA card that work provides. 1:15 p.m. — When I get back from physical therapy, I quickly eat lunch before my staff meeting. 5:30 p.m. — Once I get home, I force myself to work out. If I sit on the couch, I'm never getting up again. I do 30 minutes on the elliptical machine in my building while listening to the podcast. I round out my workout with squats and a few upper-body and ab exercises. After, I cook the meats I marinated yesterday and roast broccoli. For dinner, I eat the broccoli and the leftover salmon. I spend the rest of the evening watching TV and do a meditation session since I'm feeling pretty stressed about work. I briefly chat with my boyfriend before I hit the hay around 11:30.

"7:25 a.m. — I have my annual checkup this morning and blood will be taken, but I've learned that the nurses can't get any from me unless I eat more than usual. I have my regular coffee, followed by two pieces of naan and hummus. I also do my PT exercises and hop on metro. A few months ago, my doctor and insurance got into a fight, and now my office is out of network. But since I had difficulty finding a new doctor who seemed decent and was available at reasonable timeframes, I'm sticking with my current practice. My work gives us $3,000 towards medical expenses anyway. I did pick a new primary care doctor because my last one left in the hullabaloo. I'm very pleased with the new doctor. She says things like, ""I want you to feel like you can always reach out,"" and ""I don't like to let things fall through the cracks."" After the appointment and blood work, I'm told I will get billed later. 12 p.m. — For lunch, I eat flank steak with roasted broccoli and a white bean puree. I made the puree a few weeks ago and was smart enough to freeze a few portions for weeks when I wasn't as into cooking. During lunch, I realize I'm out of cat supplies and place an order on Chewy.com for food, litter, a few cheap cat toys, and a new water fountain (my cat refuses to drink water). I also buy a humidifier on Amazon because my bedroom is so dry, and I wake up incredibly congested every morning. I spend the rest of the day working on a big report and snacking on peppers, blueberries, and clementines. $126.59 5:45 p.m. — At home, I eat a pre-made salad from the supermarket for dinner, as well as coconut rice from the freezer. Then, it's time for my therapy session. I see a Canadian therapist via Skype. It was fairly random, but while traveling, my mom started talking to my now therapist and realized she was in school for therapy. My mom had a feeling that we would be a great fit, and it turns out we were. She has helped me through a lot of the health anxiety I developed after I got an undiagnosed tropical illness last year after a trip and hurt my back shortly after. Plus, since she isn't yet licensed and gets paid in Canadian dollars, she's super cheap! (It was so difficult to find an affordable one here since most ""good"" therapists tend not to take insurance.) After my session, I do a quick, 30-minute yoga class because I feel like I haven't moved much today. It wasn't hard but something is better than nothing! $41.25 Daily Total: $167.84",6,240
"7:25 a.m. — Typical morning routine: coffee, yogurt, and PT. 10 a.m. — It's the last day of the month, which means it's time to pay my bills. I check my bank account, and my paycheck is $100 higher than usual. I realize the new tax bill must have kicked in. Since the vet mentioned that the cat would need dental work and quoted me $750-$950, I decide to use the extra money for a kitty fund. It's easier for me to keep track of saving for specific things by having separate accounts, and I spend a few minutes looking into the costs of starting a separate savings account at my bank. Since I can get a savings account for free if I have a certain amount in other accounts, I quickly get the account and transfer $200 to start. Then I set up a recurring transfer of $85 a month. 12 p.m. — I try to meet a friend who works in a nearby office building at least once a week for lunch. Since we both tend to bring our lunches, we found an office building that has a basement with tables and is open to the public. However, my friend is super busy at work today, and she asks if we can reschedule. I eat the same steak/broccoli/beans at my desk and later snack on the same peppers/blueberries, clementines. Since I'm still hungry despite all the snacks, I take one more Luna bar from my coworker's stash. I'm worried this is becoming a habit, so I buy a box of my own Luna bars on Amazon and pledge to also share with the office. Bonus: I realize I can have them delivered to work. No schlepping for me! $12.97 6 p.m. — I get home and open my mail. One letter is from the vet with the name of a pheromone spray I can use to try stop the cat from pooping on the rug. I buy the spray on Amazon and pray that it works. I'm beyond tired of picking up poo every day. The other letter is from Chase, confirming that I applied for the Sapphire Reserve. It has an amazing sign-up bonus and I have two international trips planned this year, including one to a close friend's wedding. The card has a $450 annual fee but comes with a $300 travel credit, lounge access, three-times the miles on all the spending, and about $700 worth of travel from the sign-on bonus. I'll probably cancel this card next year, but after doing a lot of research about the card and how applying would impact my credit score, I decided it was worth it. I call to say I did apply and I'm approved on the spot. $16.85 6:30 p.m. — I do a yoga and barre combo workout at home, and around 7, my boyfriend comes over for dinner. I reheat the brined pork and serve it with green beans, cranberry sauce I had in the freezer. I'm feeling super achy today, so the boyfriend generously gives me a long massage. Then we watch a few episodes of (yes, that's the name of the show) and head to bed. Daily Total: $229.82",7,240
"4 p.m. — My alarm goes off, and I lay in bed answering texts, perusing Instagram, and checking out my new Hinge matches before I finally, begrudgingly, get up. I worked last night, so I went to bed around 9 a.m. I fill up my electric kettle and make a cup of tea to drink while I relax before another night of work tonight. My sister texts to let me know that she got the Haim concert tickets we've been eying. They're $61 each, and I'm really excited. I love this band and have been dying to see them live! She pays, and I'll send her a check when it gets closer to the concert. 4:45 p.m. — I lay in bed drinking tea, watching on Netflix, and eating a few chocolates. I hate waking up and having to get ready for work right away, so I usually wake up a little early so I have time for this! 5:15 p.m. — I get dressed for work, do my makeup, and pack my lunch. I'm taking leftover slow-cooked sesame chicken and brown rice that I made earlier in the week. I absolutely love my crockpot and am trying to use it more! I pack a yogurt, clementine, and carrots with veggie dip for snacks. I heat up the rest of the chicken and brown rice leftovers to eat now and boil carrots to eat with it. 6:15 p.m. — I say goodbye to my roommate, leave for work, and drive the 20 minutes there. I work in one of Connecticut's bigger (and more dangerous) cities, and there's a lot that it has to offer. I park and hop on the shuttle that will take me to the hospital. I run into three of my coworker friends on the bus, and we catch up on the ride over. 7 p.m. — My shift starts, and it's a busy one! I have four patients but I soon get a fifth as another person is admitted to the floor. 11:30 p.m. — I quickly eat a yogurt as I try to start some paperwork, unfortunately without much success due to a few pressing emergencies on my floor. 3 a.m. — Time to finally start all the paperwork that comes along with my job! I'm starving, so I heat up my leftover chicken and brown rice and eat it at the front desk while charting. My clementine and carrots will unfortunately go uneaten, but I'll just save them to pack another day. 7:45 a.m. — My shift is finally over, and I'm definitely looking forward to bed! My friend and I wait around for another friend to finish her shift. We chat for a bit and all leave 20 minutes later. We contemplate going out to breakfast before going home, but decide to go another time instead. 8:15 a.m. — I'm feeling hungry on my drive home, and I tell myself that I deserve a bacon, egg, and cheese after the shift that I had. I stop at a small bagel shop down the street from my apartment and buy a BEC on a plain bagel. I shower, devour the delicious breakfast sandwich, and get ready for bed. $4.20 9:30 a.m. — Finally time to sleep! With my blackout shades drawn and my noise machine on, I hop into bed and soon fall into a deep sleep. Daily Total: $4.20",1,241
"2 p.m. — I wake up to my alarm, and even though I'm tired, I know that I have to get up. I have the next two days off, and then I'm working day shifts, so I have to get my body back to sleeping at night. After finally dragging myself out of bed, I browse Pinterest for recipe ideas, eat a bowl of Special K Red Berries, and make a grocery list. 3 p.m. — I head to Stop & Shop where I stock up on groceries for the week. I buy bananas, string beans, salmon, milk, cheese, yogurt, ingredients for chili, and ingredients to make the ground turkey sweet potato skillet recipe I found on Pinterest. I also grab a bag of mints for my grandpa (he's trying to quit smoking and has been eating mints when he wants a cigarette) and a bag of black licorice for my grandma. I'm visiting my grandparents tomorrow, and they'll appreciate the little surprise. My groceries come to $60.08. I have a dollar scratch-off ticket in my wallet that I decide to cash on my way out of the store, and I get a whole $2! I use the $2 as a credit I can apply to my grocery bill and leave the store feeling bizarrely happy to have cut down on the bill. $58.08 4 p.m. — I unpack my groceries, throw a load of laundry in the wash, and head to the gym. I spend over an hour on the elliptical, using the weights, and running on the treadmill. I have always hated running, but I'm trying to get into it this year! Even though I run super slow and tire easily, I'm proud of myself for trying. 5:30 p.m. — Back at my apartment, my roommate is getting ready for work. She's also a nurse and works nights. Our schedules are usually pretty similar, but this week they're practically opposite so I won't see much of her until the weekend. I clean my bathroom and do another load of laundry before lounging on the couch for a little bit. 6:30 p.m. — I cook dinner — balsamic string beans and salmon. It's so delicious (and healthy) that I end up eating it all. 8 p.m. — I settle on the couch for a night of watching . My roommate is at work tonight so I'm watching solo. I wasn't a fan of this season in the beginning, but I'm hooked now. Despite being forever single, I'm a hopeless romantic, and I get addicted to this show every time I watch it, as corny as it can be sometimes. 11:45 p.m. — Bedtime.

"8:30 a.m. — I wake up naturally before my alarm goes off, something that rarely happens. I'm still lying in bed when I get a call from my grandparents. I was supposed to visit them today and take them to lunch, but it's snowing a little and they're worried about me driving the 45 minutes to their house. They suggest that I visit another day in the next few weeks, and although I'm bummed I won't be seeing them today, I don't want them to worry and agree to reschedule. 9:45 a.m. — I make scrambled eggs and a whole grain English muffin for breakfast and pour myself a glass of orange juice. When I'm done, I settle on the couch with a giant mug of Irish breakfast tea with a dash of milk in it. I alternate between watching more of and reading a book my mom recommended. I've only read a few chapters so far, so I'm not super invested in it yet. I love reading though, and I try to always have a book going. I usually either read books that my mom, also an avid reader (and a librarian), loans me or that I borrow from the local library. I take a brief break from my lazy morning to clean the kitchen before relaxing once again. 12:45 p.m. — I eat a clementine and Special K while reading my book and perusing the internet. 1:30 p.m. — I decide to go see a movie since my plans with my grandparents got cancelled. I see , which I'm excited about since it got nominated for a lot of Oscars. Since it's so last minute, I end up seeing the movie alone. It feels strange, but I actually really enjoy the experience and consider doing it more often. The movie is really good, and it's discount Tuesday, so the ticket is cheap. $6.10 3:45 p.m. — I leave the movie theater and go to the gym. I spend over an hour there using the weights and jogging on the treadmill. 6 p.m. — I eat a Quaker Oats breakfast square and make chili using one of my mom's recipes. I let it simmer for an hour before eating dinner. 8 p.m. — I call my mom and we chat for 20 minutes. Then I relax with my book, more , and a cup of hot chocolate that I hope will satisfy my craving for sweets. 10:30 p.m. — I get in bed much earlier than I usually would because I'm working a day shift tomorrow and have to be up bright and early.

I put on my scrubs and eat breakfast — a whole grain English muffin with all-natural peanut butter on it and a glass of orange juice. I pack my lunch with leftover chili and snacks I have on hand and leave for work at 6:20. 7 a.m. — My workday starts. I'm the charge nurse today, which basically means I'm in charge of the whole unit and any major decisions or problems that come up throughout the shift. I see my three patients, do their assessments, and pass out their medications. 11 a.m. — I eat a Siggi's yogurt to curb my mid-morning hunger. Good thing I did since we soon discover that the door to our break room is broken and we can't get in to eat our lunches! 1 p.m. — I attend a meeting with some of the doctors, social workers, physical therapists, and other staff that work on our floor. When it finishes, I'm luckily able to get into the break room for lunch! I eat my leftover chili, clementine, and carrots with veggie dip. 5 p.m. — One of my coworkers gets upsetting news, and I'm reminded of how great the people I work with are. We hug and support our coworker and, still all in disbelief, get back to caring for our patients. 8 p.m. — I leave work and drive home. I'm starving, but I take a quick shower before eating dinner (Trader Joe's Reduced Guilt Mac & Cheese, a granola bar, and honey-wheat pretzels) in my pajamas in front of Netflix. 10:30 p.m. — I climb in bed, exhausted.

The floor is really busy, so I'm trying to help everyone as much as possible, especially since I'm the charge nurse again. I discharge one of my coworker's patients for him. 12:30 p.m. — I drink a Siggi's drinkable strawberry yogurt to help get me through my 1 p.m. meeting without getting hangry. I attend my meeting (similar to the one I went to yesterday) and collaborate with other hospital coworkers to help coordinate more of our patient discharges. 1:30 p.m. — I take a break from the busy floor to eat my lunch. It's more leftover chili that I packed from home, a string cheese, and a granola bar. I usually pack my lunch to save money and to avoid having to spend the time going downstairs to the cafeteria. My coworker's steak and mushroom quesadilla does look tempting though! 3 p.m. — New patients keep arriving on the floor, and I try to help everyone out as much as possible while keeping my sanity. 8 p.m. — It's finally time to leave! After finishing up some paperwork, I head home, where my best friend is waiting for me. She lives in Manhattan but has a work event in Connecticut tomorrow, so she's staying with me tonight. She took the train from the city and is waiting for me when I get home. 9 p.m. — After showering and changing out of my scrubs, I head downtown to a local bar with my best friend and my roommate. The three of us decide to grab drinks and apps. I get a beer and they both get cocktails. We split boneless BBQ wings, Asian calamari, nachos, and the most delicious brussels sprouts I have ever had! We catch up, talk about relationships (we're all single and having no luck in the dating scene), and reminisce about some of our favorite memories. We devour most of our food, split the check, and head back to the apartment sleepy and quite full. $29.76 11 p.m. — My best friend and I are exhausted since we were both up early for work.

We get ready and then head to my favorite bagel shop to get breakfast sandwiches and orange juice. We pay separately. $6.33 10:30 a.m. — We find out that my friend's coworkers are running late traveling from the city, so we decide to find a Starbucks to hang out at and get our caffeine fix. Neither of us drinks coffee, so we each get a black tea. My friend tells me more about her new job. We're both so thankful for this short and unexpected visit. $2.39 11:30 a.m. — I drop off my best friend where she's meeting her coworkers and say goodbye with a big hug. We don't know when we'll see each other next, but we both agree it has to be soon! I stop at a few boutiques on my drive home to look for a birthday present for my roommate, but nothing catches my eye. I decide to swing by the mall, and I stop for gas on the way there. I use my Stop & Shop gas points to get a $0.20/gallon discount, which is good since my tank is practically empty. $24.01 12:30 p.m. — There's nothing great at the mall, but I still grab gummy bears and lip gloss my roommate likes to add to her present. I also buy chocolate for myself because I have no willpower. $12.82 1 p.m. — I then head to the local liquor store and buy two bottles of cabernet sauvignon, one for me and one for my roomie. I know absolutely nothing about wine, so I always end up picking bottles at random. Here's to them being good! $24.42 2 p.m. — I'm finally hungry for lunch and eat a bowl of chili and slice up Havarti cheese. (I absolutely love cheese; it's a weakness of mine and a staple in my diet.) I watch , eat a banana, and call my grandma and grandpa to reschedule our lunch date. I then browse Money Diaries, and feeling inspired by one I just read, I decide to download the Duolingo app. 4:45 p.m. — I go to the gym for a quick workout and spend most of my time jogging on the treadmill. Even though I go slow and walk at times, I notice that this run seems easier than others, and I'm proud of my progress. 6 p.m. — I planning on having a quiet night at home but my roommate invites me to dinner with her work friends. I shower, curl my hair, and get dressed up. I basically live in scrubs, workout clothes, and pajamas, so this is a treat! 7:30 p.m. — My roommate, our friend, and I arrive at the Mexican restaurant where we're meeting a large group of their friends. They won't seat us until everyone has arrived, so we grab a drink the bar. I order a sangria, and my roommate pays the tab, but I give her $10. Once we're seated, we order chips and guacamole and all get steak tacos. They're delicious. We keep ordering rounds of drinks (three margaritas for me), and we spend four hours there. I'm proud of myself for going out even though I didn't know most of the group, and we end up having a great time. We get separate checks, and mine is $61.91 before tip. $71.91 11:30 p.m. — We leave the restaurant to go to a nearby bar for beers and hang out at a table in back; one of my friends pays. After we leave, we go to a tequila bar and get a round of margaritas. My friend and I pay for my roommate's drink. We hang out there until the bar closes. $23.27 2:30 a.m. — We get home and I eat a few honey wheat pretzels and drink a glass of water. I'm in my pajamas and about to go to bed when my roommate suggests going to McDonald's. We make a quick trip to the drive-through (my roommate insists on paying even though I offer) and munch on burgers, fries, and chicken nuggets before finally going to bed at 3 a.m. Daily Total: $165.15",6,241
"10:45 a.m. — No alarm today! I sleep in after getting to bed much later than I wanted to last night. Feeling dehydrated and hoping I'm not super hungover, I decide to stay in bed and finish the last episode of that's on Netflix. Olivia Pope has been annoying me for the last few seasons, but I feel determined to finish the show anyway. I drink some water, finish , and then switch to watching , which I haven't seen in a while. 12:15 p.m. — I finally crawl out of bed to eat a banana and a bowl of cereal. I then decide to embrace the laziness of today and lay in bed to watch more while working up the energy to go to the gym. 3 p.m. — I do a load of laundry, drink some of my Naked smoothie, eat a handful of almonds, and head to the gym. I'm not feeling 100%, so all I manage is a walk on the treadmill. I listen to a few different podcasts while working out. I try to drop off my rent payment on the way back to my apartment, but no one is in the leasing office so I head home instead and remind myself to come back soon. 6 p.m. — My roommate and I drive to our friend's apartment. We pick up a pepperoni pizza on the way, which our friend has already paid for. We eat and drink vodka sodas, and I give our friend $10 for the pizza and alcohol she is providing. After pre-gaming and having some much-needed girl talk, we head out to a local bar. $10 11 p.m. — My friend buys the first round of drinks — Jameson and gingers for us and a vodka soda with cranberry for my roommate. We enjoy people-watching and can't help commenting on how many guys with man buns there are in the bar. Who knew that those were still a thing?! I buy the next round of drinks, and we decide to dance for a while; the DJ is playing great songs, including a lot of throwbacks! My friend and my roommate each get a beer but I refrain because I'm the DD and I don't want to be too buzzed. $40 1:30 a.m. — We leave the bar and stop at a food truck for hot dogs and fries before walking back to our friend's apartment. My roommate pays since I drove tonight. 2:30 a.m. — We get home, drink water, and get ready for bed. I rarely stay out late at bars anymore, so after two nights of going out, I'm ready for my bed and a relaxing day tomorrow! Daily Total: $50",7,241
"6 a.m. — Wake up; thanks, jet lag! 7:30 a.m. — I'm fighting a cold and decide to sleep until the last minute before I get up, make coffee, get ready for work, and head out. New York is so cold right now, but thankfully I missed the bulk of the snowstorm while I was away for Christmas. 9 a.m. — I had to get a new MetroCard so I arrive at work little later than usual. I eat breakfast (a yogurt I found in my fridge) for breakfast. We let friends and their kids stay in our apartment over the holidays, and they left a few groceries and goodies behind. I'm starting a new job at the end of the month, so most of the next two weeks will be focused on handing over assignments, consolidating my past productions and billings, and updating my contacts. I'm nervous and excited! 12 p.m. — My husband got me a great sweater from Everlane that is a little too short; he's returning it, and I'll getting a different sweater instead. We maintain mostly separate finances, though we do have a joint emergency and holiday checking card and aren't really concerned with who pays for what. It's all love! 1 p.m. — My boss and I grab ramen for lunch. We've been working together closely for a long time so leaving is hard; he puts lunch on his company card and we bring it back to eat in the office. 5 p.m. — I got a great year-end bonus and use some of it to pay off my credit card. I only have a little bit left from our trip because my card didn't incur a high foreign transaction fee. I pay it off and slightly marvel at my ability to do so, as this wasn't always the case. $700 8 p.m. — Home. I take the dog for a walk. My husband makes dinner every night, and we eat at home. I'm just not interested in cooking, but I love to clean up. 10 p.m. — In an immense amount of pain and slightly terrified of my PT appointment tomorrow morning. I take a bath in CBD salts my husband got me for Christmas, which definitely helps. Then it's off to bed with a book. Daily Total: $700",1,242
"6:30 a.m. — Wake up, shower, coffee. I drink a full glass of water while getting ready and decide to order an UberPool to PT since it's so cold. It's very close to my office, so I can walk over after and expense the cost, and I'll have a chance to meditate beforehand. ($13.87 expensed) 9 a.m. — After an hour of very painful PT, I'm out. I had an abdominal surgery to get rid of cysts on my stomach and intestines several years ago. I also ended up getting pelvic inflammatory disease from a misplaced IUD a few years ago and have developed scar tissues all over my pelvic floor that requires internal physical therapy. I leave sore but in less acute pain. $150 9:15 a.m. — Quick treat at Starbucks, where I get a vanilla latte. I put $25 on my Starbucks mobile wallet so I don't blindly hand over my card and become more aware of my spending. $25 12:30 p.m. — My husband stops by my office and we grab lunch around the corner. I treat him to ramen and get myself a kale harvest salad. He's a freelancer and does a lot of the day-to-day errands when he's not working — paying for lunch is the least I can do. I update him on my PT appointment, and he says he'll make dinner in the Instant Pot my parents got him for Christmas. $24.75 2:45 p.m. — In an afternoon slump and browsing Amazon. I order a Moleskine notebook for my new job ($12), Benadryl ($8.82), treats for the pup ($14), new socks ($10), and dishwashing soap ($4). I'll have to buy a new laptop, so I'm trying to put myself on an austerity budget, and I refuse to look at any other websites, even though there are a couple of Ganni sweaters I have my eye on. $48.82 4 p.m. — Researching new artists, closing productions from my current job, and subtly letting people know I'm leaving. It bums me out a bit, but I snack on leftover cashew brittle we got in a gift basket from a client, along with a Pukka tea. They have the best flavors! 7:45 p.m. — Meeting our best friends for our weekly dinner - It's always fun, and we catch up on our holidays and eat way too much food. We go home around 9:30, and my husband kindly pays for our share. We take turns picking up each other's tab; it evens out in the end but it feels more special and like a date when we play ""CAN YOU GUESS THE BILL?!"" My hip is in a lot of pain from PT, so my husband helps me walk home with his arm around my waist. 9:45 p.m. — Home and in a bath with Epsom salts as directed by my physical therapist. I have peppermint tea and a piece of dark chocolate in bed, and chat with my husband before I take my sleeping pill. (I've had chronic insomnia since I was in a bad accident as a teenager. This is very low dose and doesn't give me that crazy pill hangover.) Daily Total: $234.57",2,242
"7 a.m. — Wake up, make coffee, and toast one of the crumpets we brought back from England. I'm trying not to wash my hair every day and am experimenting with different dry shampoos and ways of parting my hair. It works for now. I'll probably pull my hair back at work. 8:45 a.m. — At the office and I start going through all the emails that no longer apply to me. Being in this weird dead space of having to be at the office but not being able to work on anything new is draining. I'm purposely going into my new job with as little information as possible on the inner-workings of the company, so that I can be fresh-faced on my first day and not worry about any preconceived ideas. Getting my contacts in order is the main thing on my to-do list, but it seems a little awkward to do in front of my coworkers. I eat a banana I brought from home and start plugging away at handover notes. 1 p.m. — Head out to stretch my legs and return something at the Apple store where I also start looking at new laptops. A salesman tries to sell me on an iPad Pro with a keyboard, and won't listen when I say I'd like a laptop. I ended up having to walk away mid-sentence and go look at laptops alone, making me feel like a jerk but also proud of myself for being more assertive. I wander over to my favorite Thai place and get tofu red curry with brown rice and veggies for lunch. $11 6 p.m. — Leave the office early today so I can take a Gyrotonic Pilates class in the East Village. It's aimed at stretching your back and hips while being really gentle to your body. My husband joins me as he has a back injury. This class is a really lovely way to wind down and do guided stretches that work in conjunction with my physical therapy; it's taught by a very graceful ballerina, which makes feel like a graceful ballerina in turn. 8:30 p.m. — We eat cheesy polenta with red peppers, roasted veggies (sunchokes, peppers, sweet potatoes, broccoli, leeks, garlic, and carrots), and steak for dinner, and take the dog for a walk. I hand my husband a $10 bill for the groceries and so he'll have cash in his wallet tomorrow. $10 11:30 p.m. — Finally in bed after cleaning up the apartment. I pack lunch (leftovers from dinner) and get the pup's food ready for daycare tomorrow. I read the rest of my issue of  . (My boss gave me a subscription for the holidays.) Daily Total: $21",3,242
"6 a.m. — Jolt awake to the sound of my husband's alarm. We cuddle for a minute, and he gets ready while I lounge in bed. After he leaves for the day at 6:30, I take a shower and get ready for work, make coffee, and take the dog to daycare. I stop to get a bowl of oatmeal from a café and I'm in the office by 8:45. $4.50 10 a.m. — I make an appointment with the salon around the corner from my house. I want to look respectable in my new job, and as I normally wear sweatshirts and jeans, I think a new haircut will make me appear more put together. I also make an appointment with our accountant. My husband and I got married last spring, and since he is still on a visa and is freelancing, I'm unsure if it's best to file jointly or separately. 1 p.m. — I heat up my lunch; my office doesn't have a kitchenette or microwave, so I invested in a mini-crockpot. It doesn't cook anything but is like a small warming oven that is perfect for leftovers, veggies, soups, etc. I run out and grab a seltzer from the bodega down the block, texting my best friend on the way. He is one of the most incredible people I know; caring, talented, funny and inspiring. $1.29 4:30 p.m. — Meeting a client for coffee (I get peppermint tea) to tell him I'm leaving...The conversation goes nowhere productive, and I end up mentally exhausted. ($10 expensed) 7:15 p.m. — Home and in a weird, easily annoyed mood. My husband falls asleep with the pup and I take a bath in CBD salts while finishing my book. We walk to get food around 9 p.m. (I get veggie soup; he gets shrimp fried rice) and watch a few shows on Viceland while we eat. $24 8 p.m. — I hop on The Outnet and buy a new pair of black jeans. They're on sale and I have a code for 20% off. $85 10:45 p.m. — In bed, exhausted from being in pain and calming myself down from thinking about the new job. Am I ready to leave? Not really. Will I be good at this job? Probably. Do I know what I'm doing? Hell yes I do. Am I excited? A thousand percent. Daily Total: $114.79",4,242
"8:30 a.m. — I buy myself a TGIF latte, and then talk to my boss to figure out what needs to happen during my last week. I put feelers out for freelancers who can lend a hand at my current office for a month or so while they search for a new full time team member. No one seems promising except for the folks who are too expensive. Oh well, at least I'm trying! $4.84 12:15 p.m. — I eat a yogurt with flax seed granola and chat with another client; she's incredibly happy for me with my new job. I've bonded with my clients, and to have her recognize and appreciate the amount of work I've put in means the world. Working in my field sometimes means you're the first one blamed and the last one thanked but this group is truly special, and I'll miss speaking with them daily. 1 p.m. — At an appointment with a specialist on pelvic floor dysfunctions. It's an appointment I made almost six months ago with a doctor billed as the best in the country and boy, is she. There was a moment during the exam when I passed out from the pain and broke out into cold sweats, but I left with happy tears in my eyes from pure elation. She broke everything out in plain English and was the first doctor I've gone to that has made me feel relieved and hopeful about getting better. She was encouraging and impressed that I had already begun physical therapy, was livid that my old OB-GYN wouldn't listen and kept telling me I needed to keep my IUD in and to get used to it. I've never looked forward to a follow-up appointment so much. $40 2:30 p.m. — I walk back while chatting with my mom; she's just retired after a very successful career but thinks that my new job is going to create too much stress for me. I politely tell her that it's not the stress of the job that is killing me, it's being in constant pain for the past year, having to wait six months to see a specialist, and finding out that insurance doesn't cover basic things like a topical estrogen/pain ointment. I stop and get fresh summer rolls and prepare myself for my prescription that will cost $400 for a two-ounce tube I'll be picking up on Monday. $8.07 6:30 p.m. — The afternoon passed without much fuss, and my colleague and I decide to get a drink nearby. I was supposed to be doing Dry January with my husband, but with all these changes happening lately (and never one to drink often anyways), I decided to make it Dry Feb instead. We each get a cocktail, split a plate of fries, and chat for an hour or so. I'm really going to miss working with her. Hopefully, we'll see each other socially more! $21 8:30 p.m. — Home, chitchatting with the fam and can't decide on food. In the end, we end up smoking some weed, walking to get a pizza in the rain with the dog, and having a huge giggle fest the whole way. We end up watching silly TV, and I get over-full from pizza and a kale salad and fall into bed around 11 p.m. I read the news on my iPad, flip through , and play Words with Friends until I drift off. $25 Daily Total: $98.91",5,242
"9:30 a.m. — Awake tidying up the house, and I find out we have no milk for coffee. My husband wakes up, and we snuggle the dog, who would sleep tucked in his cozy cave until noon if we let him. We bundle up, take the dog out, get a coffee ($5, including tip), share a mini-bagel ($1.91) and make my husband an appointment for a haircut. We stop at a cute neighborhood clothing shop to check out their end-of-season sale, but I don't see anything screaming my name so we leave, wallets intact. $6.91 1 p.m. — Walk a couple of blocks to my hair appointment. I love my haircut (lots of layers that magically make it feel wavy) and the products she uses so much that I buy them ($105 for the cut, $78 for the product, $20 for tip, directly to the stylist on Venmo). On my way home, I stop at the bodega to get milk, seltzer, and a lemon ($8). I have SodaStream but I've forgotten to replace the gas canister for the past three months. $211 3 p.m. — Change the bedding and then gather up our tax and green card documents. We have an appointment with an accountant on Monday, and I don't like not being prepared. I spend the afternoon doing agency and contact research, making notes in my new Moleskine, and looking at the new agency website. 8 p.m. — My husband and I meet our good friends for dinner; we end up sharing a bunch of plates at a cute (also LOUD) restaurant further out in Brooklyn. We walked from our house and are completely frozen when we arrive. They just came back from Cambodia and brought us back amazing gifts. I'm so excited to put up the hammock they gave us this summer. The food was delicious (octopus, ceviche, roasted cauliflower, and more) but catching up was the best. We split evenly; my husband and I put it on our joint card. It's a late one, and we end up sharing their cab part of the way home. I don't have any cash to contribute to the ride but we'll get the next one! $120 Daily Total: $337.91",6,242
"9 a.m. — Wake up after a fitful night of sleep. I took my normal sleeping tablet but I was up every few hours in pain; it seems like all I do is complain about it, but it's so intense that it's honestly consuming me. Our best friends ask if we'd like to have brunch at noon so we get ready, take the dog for a walk and run him in the park, drop him off, and head over to a restaurant we've never been to. It turns out to be delicious; I get almond toast with a latte and share the salad that comes with my husband's burger.  My husband ran an errand for me, and I didn't pay him back yet, so this is my treat. $51 2 p.m. — Home and tidying up. Sorting out clothes to give away to our friend who does a lot of homeless outreach. I bought myself a new parka for the holidays and make sure my old one is in good shape and clean to give away. I noticed doing this diary that I tidy up a lot; I guess that is just what happens when you have a big dog who loves to play in the dirt and throw his toys everywhere living in an NYC apartment. 3 p.m. — We booked a cleaner from Handy to tackle the hardcore cleaning. We don't normally do this, but the guests that stayed in our apartment over New Years have two little kids that left the floor really sticky... The cleaner is the nicest guy. The apartment looks cleaner than I've seen it in years and I'm so pleased with the result. The guests gave us $100 for a cleaner, and I pay him $20 for tip. $20 4:30 p.m. — While the cleaner is around, we take the dog out to run errands but nowhere has anything we need, so we stop at Whole Foods. Yes, we have the dog with us. We've never done it before, but everyone was surprisingly cool with it. He is registered as an emotional-support dog, is wearing a coat, and stays in a heel by my husband's side the whole time. We decided to make a ragout in the Instant Pot, watch a movie, and have a cozy day. We buy meat, veggies, and pasta for it, along with other pantry staples and vitamins for the upcoming week ($36). Our friends come over around 7 with a bottle of wine for the sauce, and our dogs play in the middle of the floor while we chat and decide which movie to watch. My father bought my husband a ridiculously big TV with surround sound for our living room. We go with ($5.99), and it is excellent. $41.99 1 a.m. — Our friends leave and my husband takes the pup out while I clean up from dinner. Tomorrow's Monday, but it's a holiday so I can afford to stay up later than normal. Thank god for a lay-in. Daily Total: $112.99",7,242
"7 a.m. — I always set my alarm for 6:45, but I get up when it goes off, especially on Mondays. I wake up my boyfriend, and he hops right out of bed, lets the dogs out, and starts getting ready for work. I check my phone quickly and get out of bed, too. I work in a very relaxed office, and I spend a good amount of time outside. This week, I am in the office, so I feed the dogs while I pack my lunch and make a smoothie for breakfast. I am out the door around 7:45 with the dogs in tow. Like I said, it's a very relaxed office so the pups tag along. 8:15 a.m. — Get to work. I settle in, start drinking my smoothie, check my emails, submit my time card from the week before, and look at my W-2 forms. The last two years, I have owed over $2,000, so I'm triple-checking to make sure everything is entered correctly. I work two shifts a week as a server at a restaurant and having two incomes always screws me. It's been amazing and terrible at the same time. I currently work on Saturdays and Sundays, so I never have a day off unless I request one — and I only ever do that when my boyfriend and I have bigger plans. No lazy Sundays in bed for me. 2:30 p.m. — Eat lunch very late today (leftover tacos, a small salad, and an apple) — all things I brought from home. 5 p.m. — Leave work to drop the dogs off and go straight to the gym. I eat a yogurt before I head back out. I've been trying to switch up my exercise routine so I don't get bored, but I like to go on Mondays so I start my week off feeling accomplished. 8 p.m. — Make dinner for myself; my boyfriend had a work event tonight, and he's already fed. I feed the dogs, and he does the dishes. We had friends staying with us for a couple of months, so he makes progress on setting back up our office after the dishes are done. 9 p.m. — Boyfriend finishes installing updates on our desktop computer and setting everything up. I start updating my résumé and LinkedIn profile. Finding jobs in my field is challenging, especially if you can't relocate, but a client shared a job they thought would be perfect for me, and it is! I'm hoping it works out. Although I love the flexibility of my job, I feel like there isn't much room for growth. Because the staff is small, I get stuck doing a lot of lower-level tasks I hoped to avoid by getting a master's. My boyfriend started a new job recently that he loves, so unfortunately, relocating isn't an option right now. (Though I love moving around!) 11:45 p.m. — Finish up my résumé for the night. (I decided to completely redo everything, including the formatting.) I shower and read a little. My resolution this year is to read at least one book a month, but this is way later than I like to go to bed. I'll regret this in the morning. Daily Total: $0",1,243
"7:30 a.m. — Ugh, my phone died overnight (I didn't connect it to the wireless charger properly) so I am super late. I rush around, pack up leftovers for lunch, and make a smoothie. My boyfriend deals with the dogs this morning because I'm so behind. I am out the door in 40 minutes, but while trying to put the dogs in the car (we didn't put their leashes on) one decides to go for a romp in the neighbor's yard. We panic for 10 minutes, trying to get control of her. I never let them off leash outside of fenced-in areas because I'm too paranoid. The one day I decide to give it a go, it fails miserably! At least the puppy jumped right into the car. 8:30 a.m. — Get to work and luckily, my boss isn't there yet. I have a pretty easy day. I drink my smoothie and make a list of the things I want to get done. I check my bank account because I forgot about a scheduled payment on my LOFT credit card. I bought a dress for my boyfriend's holiday party last month and set up the payment to pay in full on the due date. $42.73 1 p.m. — Give in to temptation and get broccoli cheddar soup from Panera and then eat my apple as well. I watch part of the recent episode on Hulu while I eat. My boyfriend pretty much refuses to watch any of my guilty pleasure television shows so I usually save them for the gym and while I eat lunch. $6.39 3 p.m. — The restaurant just called, begging me to work tonight. I normally only work on Saturdays and Sundays but a coworker has the flu. I'll have to rush out of here to drop the dogs off home and get back to the restaurant. I'll be a little late but beggars (the restaurant) can't be choosers. At least this will help even more with my taxes. After the last two years of being blindsided with taxes (the first year, my company didn't take the correct taxes out, and last year, I picked up my second job), I'm determined to be a little more prepared this year. I have been saving up and planned to leave the restaurant after I paid my taxes this year, but since we decided to go to Hawaii, I'm going to work until we leave to save money so we don't have to pick and choose what we do. 9 p.m. — Quick, very slow shift; I'm already home. Didn't make much money but it's more than I had at the beginning of the day — and $43 won't hurt. I inhale a yogurt because I haven't eaten anything except a few French fries since lunch. Get ready for bed and read. I'm asleep around 11. Daily Total: $49.12",2,243
"7:15 a.m. — I wanted to see see the lunar eclipse and supermoon this morning, but of course it was cloudy. I am convinced that it's cloudy every time there is supposed to be a neat astronomical event. We do our normal morning routine, and I try a little harder today to look nice and put makeup on. I am going to a new dentist today. 8:15 a.m. — Get to work, where I catch up on what happened during the State of the Union. I am very much a liberal and cannot listen to our current president talk; it makes me too angry or sad, depending on the topic. I usually read his speeches or a synopsis the next day because I still want to be informed. 11:15 a.m. — Ugh, I have five cavities! I go to the dentist every six months, religiously, but I feel like I haven't gotten the best care since I've move here. I decided to go try my boyfriend's dentist and this checkup confirmed that! At the end of the week, I'll have to get three of the cavities filled in; after that, we'll schedule the last two. (One of the cavities wasn't filled right and needs to be redone.) I'm so annoyed! My dental insurance covered this exam but I'll have to use my HSA card to pay for my portion of the fillings. I have a $50 deductible, and then my insurance will pay for 80% of fillings after that. 1:30 p.m. — I eat lunch (yogurt, a granola bar, and raw cauliflower with dressing). I usually bring leftovers but I didn't cook last night so it's bit of a thrown-together lunch today. 5 p.m. — Load the pups into the car and head home, eating an apple on the way. My boyfriend may be working late tonight as well. I'm trying to decide if I want to make dinner for myself again or order a pizza after I work out. Currently, pizza is winning. 6:30 p.m. — I sat in traffic forever! I'm doing a DVD workout tonight. I like changing it up but both dogs tend to get in my way or lick my face while I'm moving. I get a check from Victoria's Secret in the mail. I accidentally overpaid my account last month so they sent me the balance ($11.40). My boyfriend gets home shortly after I finish and he wants pizza, too! He pays. 9 p.m. — Get back to updating my résumé and cover letter. Cover letters are the . I absolutely hate writing them and always feel like I am not saying the right thing. I get sucked into formatting and Googling good cover letter tips, and don't realize I've been working on it for two hours. Go to bed around 11. This week is killing me. I try to be asleep around 10 most weeknights. Daily Total: $0",3,243
"9 a.m. — I get to work late today. My boss is out of the office, so I slept in a little. Office days are usually pretty light, but field days can easily be 10 or 12 hours long. So, when we have the opportunity to sleep in a little bit, we usually take it — and I have very little to do today. I drink my smoothie and check my bank account. I probably do this more than I should, but I never understand people who don't know how much money they have in their accounts. 10:30 a.m. — It's officially February — I bite the bullet and submit my taxes. I still have to file my city taxes (Ohio has state and city taxes) but those are usually pretty accurate and not altered much by having a second job. I have a separate tax savings account, but although I put the money aside for this very purpose, sending this much money off isn't exactly thrilling. $1,430 1:30 p.m. — Eat lunch: BBQ pulled chicken I made last night in the crockpot, yogurt, and raw cauliflower with dressing. 5:15 p.m. — Drive home. I was going to go to the gym but a friend I haven't talked to in awhile calls. By the time we get off the phone it is almost 6:30. I munch on a couple of cookies my boyfriend brought home from his work function last night. 7 p.m. — Time for dinner. I roast brussels sprouts to go along with the leftover chicken. 10 p.m. — Attempt to go to bed early, but I end up reading for about an hour. This is such a late week for me! Daily Total: $1,430",4,243
"7 a.m. — Dentist appointment. Everything goes well and insurance covers most of it — I just have my deductible and the percentage I'm responsible for. I put it on my HSA card, so although it sucks, that is what that money is for. $130 8 a.m. — I have needed to go to Target for like two weeks, but it's impossible for me to go in there and only get things I need, so I have been putting it off. The dentist's office is right next to Target though. I finally swing by determined to buy things on my list: acne cream (I never had acne in my entire life, but around age 30, I started breaking out occasionally and it's the worst), dry shampoo (I've been using baby powder, which is ... not working out well), and hair ties ($45.33). I also get a Valentine's Day card for my boyfriend and a peanut butter egg because I'm obsessed ($9.70). Could have been worse — I spent time browsing the face mask and décor aisles. $55.03 9 a.m. — I'v been at work for about half an hour. It's Friday and I am so looking forward to tonight. Since I normally work late on Saturday nights and during the day on Sundays, Friday nights are the only part of the week that feel like time off to me. I usually try to leave work a bit early and will probably do that today as well. 10:40 a.m. — Check my bank account. I am getting reimbursed $160 for a claim I made on the dog insurance about two weeks ago. As much as I hate paying for the insurance every month, having them reimburse 90% of the puppies' first-year wellness visit is awesome. I also see that my $95 yearly fee for my Chase Sapphire card went through. I love this card; it has a great points reward system and is amazing when traveling internationally. That being said, my boyfriend has the Sapphire Reserve, which has a much higher yearly fee but much better perks. I transfer all my points to him, and we book travel and redeem points through his account. At this point, I'm not sure if us both having a card with a yearly fee makes sense. This might be my last year I have my card. $95 1 p.m. — I eat leftovers for lunch, a yogurt, and carrots with peanut butter. 3 p.m. — I don't have much left to do so I screw around online, trying to stay motivated and finish the last thing I need to do today. I have tracked all of my debt since I started seriously trying to pay it off about over two years ago, and I spend too much time today envisioning how I'll pay off of the last $6,000 (mostly student loans). It mostly involves fantasies of an SUV and not working a second job. 5 p.m. — Do a quick HIIT workout. My boyfriend and I are going out to dinner tonight, and I need to shower and get ready. 7 p.m. — We have a $25 gift card, but it doesn't go far at this restaurant. I order one drink, he orders two, and we both get an entree. $85.14 10:30 p.m. — We were supposed to book hotels for our trip to Hawaii, but I fell asleep on the couch. Daily Total: $365.17",5,243
"9:30 a.m. — Wake up later than I wanted. I like to go to a 9:45 class at the gym, but I slept something like 10 and a half hours according to my Fitbit, so I obviously needed the sleep more. I go to the gym after I eat breakfast. 11:30 a.m. — Boyfriend meets me at the grocery store and we shop for the week. We get lots of fruits and veggies, unsweetened almond milk, he gets lunch meat for himself, we both get yogurt and granola bars, and other items. I pay since he paid last week. $70.14 4 p.m. — I'm closing the restaurant tonight, and I hope it will be busy. I spent too much money yesterday! 11:45 p.m. — Get home from the restaurant. It was busy, and I made good money. I'm so happy! Daily Total: $70.14",6,243
"10:30 a.m. — I have to open the restaurant and on the way, I stop at a gas station for an energy drink anda Snickers. $6.97 5 p.m. — Get home from the restaurant; it was somewhat busy, but people always tip terribly on Sundays. What is the deal?! 6 p.m. — Its Super Bowl Sunday but we decide to not watch and book our Hawaii hotels. I order and pay for pizza since my boyfriend bought the pizza last week. (We habitually order pizza once a week.) $19.98 10 p.m. — We've finally finished booking everything, and we paid for most of it with points. (We are staying a few different places so it took awhile to sort everything out.) My boyfriend paid about $500, but I paid for and reserved our rental car about a month ago, which evens us out. The total for our trip without airline vouchers and points would have been over $6,000; we only paid $1,500! $117.68 11 p.m. — I deposited my restaurant cash at an ATM when I picked up the pizza, so I throw that on my credit card before bed. Despite my expensive week, our planning and saving has meant that my credit card, checking, and savings account barely saw a hit. Nights like this remind me why working at the restaurant a couple of days a week is worth it. It was a long weekend and my ""real"" work week is about to start. Daily Total: $144.63",7,243
"6:30 a.m. — Wake up to my alarm and an email letting me know that it's time to pay rent. I check my bank account and it also happens to be payday! I decide to pay rent tomorrow, on the first of the month. I make a cup of tea, brush my teeth, kiss my boyfriend goodbye as he leaves for work, and do my usual routine of catching up on news and eating breakfast, getting dressed, and doing my makeup. 7:40 a.m. — I am lucky that Denver has a free bus that takes you from one side of downtown to the other. Public transportation is awesome but free public transportation is even better! 12:30 p.m. — Lunch time. I try to take my lunches as late as I can or else I'll need a snack around 3. Lunch today is a leftover turkey and pepper burrito bowl from dinner last night. It's actually pretty tasty as leftovers, and satisfying. 5:30 p.m. — I usually leave the office around 5, and it's 5:30 by the time I get home. I'm already hungry! Decide to skip the gym today because I really pushed myself climbing the night before. Boyfriend comes home around 6 o'clock, and we start making dinner: whole-wheat pasta with mushrooms and a salad. That's essentially all we have in the fridge and we decide to go grocery shopping after we eat. 7:45 p.m. — Grocery shopping wasn't as bad as I expected, and we even bought a few items that are not on our usual shopping list. This time we picked up chicken thighs, chicken breasts, a whole chicken, lunch meat, a bunch of veggies (zucchini, mushrooms, kale, green beans, yams, onions, garlic, avocados, tomatoes, cucumbers, peppers) almond milk, orange juice, granola, beans, rice, and a few snacks for a Super Bowl party we are having this weekend! We shop at Sprouts, which has amazing deals on produce and great organic snacks. I know we are going to have to buy a few other things for our Super Bowl party this weekend but I'm totally ready for that. I put the groceries on my credit card and my boyfriend will send me money and split the bill with me. $77 8:30 p.m. — We get home after a stressful trip to Walgreens, where my boyfriend had to deal with insurance issues when getting his medicine. We end up ranting to each other about single-payer healthcare and how the U.S. to move towards it. We munch on grapes while putting away the groceries, and later watch Food Network in bed. 9:30 p.m. — My boyfriend convinces me to buy climbing shoes. I started climbing with him earlier this month, and I've gone three times so far. I enjoy it, even though I am terrible. I also found out that I have a small fear of heights, but I'm slowly getting over it and learning to trust the mat when I fall off the wall. We do bouldering at the gym and it's a great way to spend time together. He pushes me to try things that are out of my comfort zone and I love him for that. I order the shoes online and after shipping and tax, they come out to $51.61. Not bad for my first pair of climbing shoes. $51.61 Daily Total: $128.61",1,244
"5:50 a.m. — This is the time my boyfriend's alarm usually goes off, but he decides to drive to work instead of taking the bus today. (He works in Boulder.) He sleeps in and we have quality cuddle time. 7:10 a.m. — I finally wake up. My bosses are out this morning so I let myself come into work late. Usually that means going to the gym in our apartment in the morning, but I would rather work out in the evening today. I eat granola with almond milk, drink my tea, and watch the show while getting ready. My lunch is already packed for today (leftover pasta), and I put grapes in a Tupperware. Head out at 8 a.m.! 11 a.m. — I remember that I need to pay rent today and log in to pay online — so easy. It is much cheaper to live with three people, but my boyfriend and I are definitely ready to move into our own place. Our lease ends in August and I've been daydreaming and browsing available houses online. We like our apartment, but want backyard space at our next place. 11:30 a.m. — Make myself green tea that I have at my desk, already feeling ready for lunch. I ate my grapes as a snack earlier in the day. I try to eat healthier five days out of the week and splurge (financially and health-wise) on the weekends. I fill up my water bottle, hoping that my hunger will stay at bay for another hour or so. 12 p.m. — I check my credit card bill since I am not being very productive at work. I have a really large bill for the month, mostly because I had a few big expenses. My boyfriend had to get an avalanche set for backcountry skiing from REI, and we put it on my REI credit card since I get a ton of cash back from REI purchases. (He paid me $309 earlier in the week, so I'm using that money to pay part of the bill now that it has transferred to my bank.) I also bought my boyfriend an early birthday present: tickets to Pod Save America live. They were $125 each and I got two because I am going! Along with a few coffee purchases from last month, it all added up to $777.67. My payment isn't due until later this month, but I would rather be early — especially since I only get paid once a month. $777.67 1:10 p.m. — Heat up my leftover pasta from last night. I usually bring veggies and salad but it's gloomy and cold today and having carbs feels nice. I eat at my desk while catching up on work and watching a Rose McGowan interview. When it is warm out, I like to eat outside, but winters usually mean eating at my desk. Not ideal, but it gives me time to catch up on a few things. 4:45 p.m. — Just finished over two hours of back-to-back meetings. So much for eating lunch later in the day because I am still hungryyyy. I snack on the small stash of nuts in my desk drawer to make it through the rest of the day. I'd like to leave by 5 but I still have lots of work to do! 5:45 p.m. — Made it home where a few packages are waiting: one from H&M, and my climbing shoes! I ordered clothes from H&M a while ago and got the cutest apricot striped sweater, an oversized cardigan, a ribbed black sweater, and Chelsea boots. Unfortunately, my climbing shoes are way too small. Bummer. Now I have to figure out how to exchange them for a bigger size. 6:30 p.m. — My boyfriend gets home from work and we cook a quick dinner of eggplant and chickpea stew in a spiced tomato sauce. We eat that with leftover rice and watch the local news on the couch. Even though my climbing shoes are too small, I really want to go to the climbing gym. We digest and head over there. 7:30 p.m. — I rent a pair of climbing shoes ($6) to try a new problem, and I finish it on my fourth try! I also buy climbing chalk ($2) that will last us forever (and I feel bad because I've been using my boyfriend's a lot). We end up staying at the gym until about 9:15 p.m., working on a few new problems and getting nice and exhausted. $8 9:45 p.m. — We get home and while I'm in the shower, I realize how hungry I am. I tell my boyfriend and he makes me a rice cake with peanut butter and raspberry jam. I eat, read a new book ( ), and decompress. So ready to fall asleep! Daily Total: $785.67",2,244
"6:30 a.m. — Waking up is hard today. I want to hit snooze but I need to get to work on time considering I got there late yesterday. I wake up, make a cup of tea, split an orange with the boyfriend, kiss him goodbye as he heads off to work, and start making breakfast. I know I need a lot of protein to get me through the day today, so I fix up a rice cake with turkey cold cuts and a scrambled egg. I drink tea and eat breakfast while watching the news, and slowly start to get ready for work. The last thing I want to do is change out of my PJs, but I drag myself along. It's ""casual"" Friday at the office, but I still need to wear something other than blue jeans. 9 a.m. — The Museum of Contemporary Art is having its winter opening celebration party tonight and my friend is a member of the museum, so she snags us tickets. It comes with a free drink ticket and we get to hang out at the museum tonight until after hours, which is pretty cool. The museum is also close to my house, so that cuts down on transportation costs! I send her money on Venmo since she bought the tickets on her card. I also remember that my boyfriend paid me for groceries and coffee, so I transfer $47 back to my checking account from the app. $16.76 10:15 a.m. — Someone brought a bag of goodies to the office. I snag a piece of pumpkin bread. 10:30 a.m. — Totally forgot that I scheduled coffee with a coworker to talk about my future and what type of jobs are next in line for me. We walk over to a coffee shop and she ends up paying. She's a really cool lady and we talk about her experiences being a working mom and focusing on your career and your kids. I'm not there yet, but I'm always interested in what's coming up in my life and how I can make the most of it. 1 p.m. — Lunch time. I am so tempted to go out and grab a big delicious crunchy salad, but I brought leftover eggplant and chickpea stew, so I end up eating that. I also brought tortilla chips for a crunch element (and because we ate all the rice yesterday). It's tasty, but its not exactly what I want, so there might be some snacking later. (I love snacks.) 3:35 p.m. — Stress-eating the rest of the pumpkin bread because of a tight, important deadline that was dropped on me. I tell myself that I can do it and get to work typing as fast as I can. 6 p.m. — I finally get home and the boyfriend made us dinner! Roast chicken with lemon with garlic potatoes and a salad, all of which is incredibly delicious. (And of course, I eat too much.) I get dressed for the night out at the museum with my friend and watch while I wait for her to let me know she's on her way. The museum is a five-minute walk from my house, so I meet her there. 10 p.m. — The Museum of Contemporary Art event is amazing, and the weather isn't so bad outside so we drink the beers that come with our tickets at the rooftop bar. After the museum, we walk over to a speakeasy style bar and restaurant for a cocktail. My boyfriend meets up with us there to hangout. I order an incredible cocktail with cognac, smoked black tea, and lemon simple syrup that tastes like magic ($13). We also order a chef-recommended charcuterie board and a very tasty fried pork appetizer. It's nice to chat and feel fancy at an underground bar! I put the total on my card ($58) but since we split the food, everyone pays me back by the end of the night. Boyfriend and I go home and are out by 12:30 a.m. $39 Daily Total: $55.76",3,244
"9 a.m. — We finally wake up and get out of bed, which turned out to be a slow process. Getting up at 9 a.m. is sleeping in for both of us. I make coffee to bring to the BF to bed, along with a glass of orange juice. I also start making a hash out of the potatoes from yesterday's dinner, eggs, onions, and parsley. We eat, get dressed, and run errands. Today, we need to return my climbing shoes that were too small. I cross my fingers that I find an affordable pair so I can use them today. 11:30 a.m. — I return the climbing shoes that were too small, but can't find any of the right sizes at the store. I'm a little bummed out, but we end up going to an REI in the same area, where I find shoes that fit great and are surprisingly comfortable (for climbing shoes). They're basically twice as expensive as the ones I had to return, but I'm sick of spending money to rent shoes at the gym and I know these will last me a long time. I use my REI credit card, so eventually I will get 15% cash back. $86 12 p.m. — We get to the climbing gym after driving on the busy highway and witnessing two car accidents. Scary! No need to rent shoes this time. Breaking in any new shoe sucks but I tell myself its worth it and try to crush a new problem. No luck, and my boyfriend and I head out to refuel and eat lunch. 12:45 p.m. — We go to an amazing, authentic hole-in-the-wall near the climbing gym called Tacos del Mexico. It is pretty busy for the lunch hour, but we end up sitting at the bar and having a great time watching the organized chaos of the kitchen. I get three tostadas, one with carnitas and two with chicken. The boyfriend gets a carnitas torta, which I of course have a bite of. I can't finish all my tostadas and give my boyfriend the rest. (I think that this is why he loves me, he always gets to eat whatever I can't fit!) $15 (including tip) 1:30 p.m. — We end up going back to the climbing gym and I finish the problem that I was working on for a while. Eventually, we make it home after stopping at several barber shops for my boyfriend to get a haircut. (They are all too busy to take walk-ins.) We get home, shower, and lay around for a bit. 5:30 p.m. — We go out to run errands before everyone comes over for the Super Bowl tomorrow. We stop at Whole Foods and buy get three pounds of chicken wings for the game and a drink for the car ride ($10.67). I put it on my card. After, we go to Target and get paper plates and napkins (not environmentally friendly, but will make our lives easier tomorrow), my BB cream, body lotion, ranch and blue cheese, carrots, celery, canned beans, razors, and Cheez-Its for us to eat while binge-watching TV tonight. Boyfriend pays, and we figure out how much I should pay him back. ($9.33) $20 7:30 p.m. — We get home from our errands, really wanting a cozy night in of doing nothing. Our roommate invites us to a party but we politely decline in favor of eating Cheez-Its all night and watching Anthony Bourdain's show . We get into bed around 11:30. Daily Total: $121",4,244
"8:30 a.m. — Another slow wake up, but I think it's due to the gray, cold day outside. We want to get to the climbing gym by 10:20 so I can make it to a yoga class, so we get out of bed by 9 and put our workout clothes on. My boyfriend makes chilaquiles, or at least his attempt at them! They were still tasty and filled us up. A few cups of coffee later, we are ready to go. 11:45 a.m. — That was a great yoga class! I haven't done yoga in a couple of years so there was definitely a learning curve, but I walk out feeling relaxed, rejuvenated, and physically tired. I feel really lucky that the climbing gym has a ton of options in terms of classes, especially since they are all geared towards making you stronger for climbing. I find my boyfriend downstairs and we leave the gym to go pick up a few more things for the Super Bowl party. We go to Sprouts and get salsa, cheese, buffalo sauce, and an apple for me to snack on in the car. He puts it on his card and I pay him back. $7.50 12:45 p.m. — There is a liquor store across the street from the grocery store, so I run in and grab a six-pack of Colorado Ciders to drink during the game. They're expensive, but I let myself splurge because I really don't drink that much and last month was Dry January! $13 4 p.m. — Everyone comes over by 4 and we turn on the game. I make buffalo cauliflower, chicken wings, and guacamole. We wanted to make nachos but everyone was stuffed from all the food our friends brought. It's a great night and the Eagles win! (That definitely made my boyfriend happy.) We tidy up the house once everyone leaves, watch with my roommate and his girlfriend, and are in bed by 9:45. Daily Total: $20.50",5,244
"6:30 a.m. — Might have to get a coffee today considering how poorly I slept. And my shoulders are killing me from the yoga class, which really was more of a strength-building class. I make a bowl of granola, drink a cup of tea, and get ready for work. Out of the door by 7:35 a.m., which is pretty good. 12 p.m. — Remember that I have part of my federal student loans to pay. I decide to pay $80 for the month of February and March so I don't have to worry about it next month. I feel grumpy about my student loans, and I'm also hungry but not in the mood for the last of the eggplant stew. I eat my leftovers around 12:30, hoping it will keep me going until I leave for the day. 5:10 p.m. — Leave the office and get on the bus. I'm skipping the gym today, which means I can really focus on cooking a delish dinner! We're having seared chicken thighs with lemon and garlic, rice with toasted almonds and dried apricots, and steamed green beans. It's so good — and there are enough leftovers for lunch tomorrow for both of us. (Not to mention that they're leftovers I'm actually excited about.) We eat, hang out, read, watch TV, and end up going to bed way too late. I have an early morning tomorrow! Daily Total: $0",6,244
"6 a.m. — Early morning because of an off-site meeting starting at 8. (I need to be there by 7:30.) I wake up kind of grumpy, drink my cup of tea, and eat a rice cake with turkey on it. There is a light breakfast at the off-site meeting, which means I will probably drink way too much coffee and eat fruit. I end up taking a Lyft because my boyfriend decided to drive to work today. I don't mind because work will pay for it! ($8.44 expensed) 1:45 p.m. — Was able to hold off on eating lunch until later. Looking forward to not being starving as soon as I get home! (And my leftovers were as good as I thought they were going to be.) 5:30 p.m. — Get home exhausted. I make dinner while my boyfriend takes the bus home, which takes about an hour and a half. Tonight, we are eating veggie soup that I made earlier in the week, and I cook bowtie pasta to add to it. We eat way too much, but get dressed to go climbing anyway. We make a pit stop so the BF can get a haircut. We make it to the climbing gym, but I don't feel very confident in my abilities to climb today and mostly do strength-building exercises. We drive home around 9:20 and pass out. Daily Total: $0",7,244
"10:45 a.m. — I wake up way past my alarm (whoops) and spend time going through my phone. I have a kickboxing class scheduled for 12:30 with a friend and I'm glad I didn't sleep through it. It's Friday but my friend and I have been off from work all week because our firms (big accounting firms) are closed between Christmas and New Year's. Small blessings, but also kind of a bummer for me since I'm a contract employee, meaning this time off is unpaid. My contract started a few weeks ago and it's so far, so good. I drink a hot coffee with collagen, eat a banana, and then my friend picks me up and we go to the class, which we paid for previously on Groupon. It's our first time so we get free gloves and they really take the time to explain things to us. The class is great and I'm feeling powerful, but before we can escape they try to get us to sign up for a membership. We want more time to think about it and they tell us we can decide after our second class. 2:30 p.m. — I get home and shower and I am DAMN hungry. I make myself a massive sandwich of leftover Christmas roast beef, mayo, and Swiss cheese on a long white roll. I wash it down with leftover coconut cream cake and carrot cake. It's my friend's birthday tonight in NYC so I start to get ready and convince my brother to drive me to the George Washington Bridge so I don't have to take a local bus from my house. I drive over to the liquor store to buy my friend a bottle of wine and Tito's for tonight, as well as a handle of Tito's for New Year's. $62.06 5 p.m. — Brother drives me to the bridge and it is . I'd usually hop into a stranger's car so that I can get across for free and they can get the carpool E-ZPass rate, but there aren't many cars out on a night like this. Instead, I take the little bus across the bridge, which costs $2. I then refill my MTA card and hop on the subway. The subways are all messed up with the holidays and I end up having to walk across town in the bitter cold. My fingers are numb and I'm ready for a drink. $22 11 p.m. — After a few hours of eating and pre-gaming, we head out to the bar. I buy a few rounds of vodka sodas and beers for myself and the birthday girl and we dance for hours. $47 12 a.m. — Hop into a cab to get to the horrible Port Authority and make it there just in time to catch a 12:30 bus home. $21.35 Daily Total: $152.41",1,245
"11 a.m. — Whoa. I am hungover despite feeling good when I went to bed. I was supposed to wake up at 9 to drive to Hartford and spend a few nights at my cousin's house for New Year's Eve. I crawl out of bed late and manage to hop into the shower and get my bag packed. I don't have the stomach to eat yet so I grab water, get into my pickup truck, and hit the road. 3 p.m. — After hours of slow driving (due to the snow) and terrible traffic, I arrive in West Hartford and call my cousin (who is also slightly hungover) to ask about the snack situation. She tells me it's dire so I stop at CVS to pick up  staples: Cool Ranch Doritos, peanut M&Ms (half-off cause they're Christmas-themed!), Cheetos, Smartfood, and a ginger ale for my stomach/hangover situation. I get to the house and land on the couch with everyone else, where we all catch up and decide what to have for dinner while eating all our snacks. $17.49 6 p.m. — Our friends want to go out but my cousin, her boyfriend (who lives with her), and I would prefer to stay in. I am on Team Order Food And Never Leave The Couch. I desperately want Thai food so I suggest that, and then my cousin's boyfriend and I order green curry and panang curry, respectively. The girls order Chinese food and my cousin's boyfriend, who is a saint, goes out into the cold to pick up everyone's orders. When he gets back, I Venmo him and eat a third of the curry before my hangover haunts me again and I need a nap. After a nap, I wake up and we play a few rounds of Catch Phrase and Pictionary while the others have a few drinks. We go to bed early because tomorrow (New Year's Eve) is gonna be a long one. $15.64 Daily Total: $33.13",2,245
"9 a.m. — I wake up feeling a hell of a lot better and crawl into my cousin's bed while her boyfriend and the girls clean up downstairs to prepare for the New Year's Eve party we are having. If there's something that my cousin and I are good at, it's avoiding cleaning. We're not totally horrible though, so after I heat up my leftover curry and she eats a bagel, we go to the grocery store. We stop at the McDonald's drive-through because my cousin wants a coffee, and I pay ($1). We make it to ShopRite and buy the stuff we need to make food for the party later. I decide on croissants wrapped around brie and jam, and I buy seltzer as well. My cousin is making meatballs and a croissant ring stuffed with chicken, sauce, and mozzarella. Yummy situations all around. $14.16 7 p.m. — We get home, laze around for a bit, and then start getting ready for the evening. People start coming at around 7 and we eat and drink way too much: prosecco spiked with rose liqueur to start, followed by John Daly's for my cousin and me. We ring in the new year, play a few games of pong and flip cup, and then my cousin and I sneak off to bed at 2. Daily Total: $14.16",3,245
"10 a.m. — I wake up feeling great, and pack up so I can leave and beat the traffic home. But after saying my goodbyes, I try to turn on the car and it won't start. Long story short: It's too damn cold and the diesel has gelled. My cousin's boyfriend tries to help me jump-start it in this -8-degree weather (God bless his soul) but nothing is working. We go back inside and eat the McDonald's sandwiches that the girls picked up for us. New year, same us. We try to jump the truck again but nothing happens. Naturally, I'm blocking in everyone else in the driveway, so we have to push the truck to the back as best we can so that the other cars can drive out over the lawn. AAA won't answer us and 2018 is doing me dirty. 3:30 p.m. — I come to terms with the fact that I will not get this truck moved and abandon it. I book a bus ticket for Hartford to NYC and leave the keys with my cousin and her boyfriend before they drop me off at the bus stop. Miserable, I wait on line in the cold for the bus, which is late. I also pull a muscle in my neck during the stress of the day and cannot move my head. I get on the bus and the guy sitting next to me won't get off the phone. I'm over this day so I tell him he's rude and he finally gets off. By some miracle, the bus gets into NYC on time. I take the subway to 175th Street and then the little $2 bus across the bridge. My mom picks me up on the other side and feels bad enough for me that she buys me a Five Guys burger and fries. $25 Daily Total: $25",4,245
"7:30 a.m. — I wake up for work after a terrible sleep and start crying from the pain in my neck. I definitely have a cold now. But since I've had the past 10 days off, I know I can't pass up on work today. First thing's first, I cancel the kickboxing class that I scheduled for tonight. I have a feeling this neck issue isn't going anywhere for a while. I drink a hot coffee with collagen and half and half while I get ready for work, and make two fried eggs and shovel them into my mouth as I run out the door. I drive my dad's van to work (and he takes a different truck) since mine is still abandoned in Connecticut and walk in a few minutes late. I catch up on emails and get to a few writing assignments. 12:45 p.m. — I bundle up and leave to get lunch. I usually meal prep for the week, but given that I got home at 9 p.m. on New Year's Day, there was no time for that. I go to the salad bar and grab lettuce, kale, broccoli, cucumbers, chicken, feta, and a bean and wheat berry salad. I throw balsamic garlic dressing on it and head back to the office. The rest of the afternoon goes slow since I feel so crappy. $9.28 5:45 p.m. — I get home from work and eat turkey soup while catching up on reality TV. I usually like to read after work (my first book of the year is ) but I'm tired and in too much pain to care. I watch and revel in the gossip before taking Advil PM and going to sleep. Daily Total: $9.28",5,245
"7:30 a.m. — I wake up and get ready for work while drinking my collagen coffee. I had the energy to make pumpkin overnight oats (canned pumpkin, oats, unsweetened vanilla almond milk, honey, chia seeds, cinnamon, and nutmeg) last night before going to bed, so I bring that along with me to work and eat at my desk. I got a Fitbit for Christmas and decide to get my steps in today by taking a few walks around the office. Later, I do some work and then catch up with my cousin. It looks like there's going to be a blizzard tomorrow and my cousin and I are panicking about the truck situation. She has to park her cars in the driveway because there will be a street parking suspension and my truck is still stuck in the way. Not a good day. It's about 25 degrees today and my cousin is going to try and start the truck when she gets home. Prayers up that it moves because if not, I will have to pay to get it towed. 1 p.m. — I dug through the fridge this morning and managed to find food to bring for lunch. I have chicken and potatoes in a creamy lemon sauce. Mmmm. 5 p.m. — I stop at Trader Joe's to stock up on the essentials I will need. I like to get my cooking oils and shelf items here because they're usually cheaper, while I get my meats and produce at my local grocery store. I pick up ghee, coconut aminos, Turkish honey, yuzu hot sauce (I'm VERY interested in this), Turkish dried figs, New Zealand sweet apple rings (dried apples), kalamata olives in EVOO, canned wild Alaskan pink salmon, nutritional yeast (I literally don't know why I bought this, but I always end up with a few rogue items when I go to TJ's), unsweetened organic pea protein powder, prosciutto slices, riced cauliflower, and a frozen seafood blend. $67.91 6 p.m. — After a few days of thinking about it, I decide to buy a membership to the kickboxing place. I know it's a huge expense, but I also know I will really enjoy it and that it'll supplement my home workouts. The manager said the gym would honor the 2017 pricing if I signed up after my second class but I haven't been back since my neck was killing me. I go today to see if they will still honor the pricing (my friend already signed up) and they do! Somehow, I get a great deal for a 60-class package: All told, it works out to just under $9 per class. I hand over my credit card and rip off the Band-Aid, praying that my neck will feel better soon. $494 7 p.m. — I get home and there's pulled pork and a red cabbage, red, onion, jalapeño, and cilantro slaw waiting for me. Damn am I happy. I eat dinner, watch , get into bed, play and lose HQ Trivia, and go to sleep. Daily Total: $561.91",6,245
"8:54 a.m. — SNOW DAY! The offices are closed because of the ""bomb cyclone"" and I relish in the extra sleep. I log onto my computer in my pajamas, sip hot coffee with collagen and half and half, and send emails and work on a few campaigns. I'm not the most productive when I work from home, so I try my best. I eat oatmeal cooked in unsweetened vanilla almond milk with sautéed apples, cinnamon, vanilla extract, and a big scoop of almond butter on top. 2 p.m. — The weather is so bad outside so there is no leaving the house. I scramble up eggs with Italian sausage and onion and then clean my room. After another half hour of work, I take a shower and ice my neck. 6 p.m. — I help my brother shovel and clear the snow off the cars outside, even though I am still in pain (maybe not the smartest move) and then have leftover pulled pork with cabbage slaw. I finish the evening off with the last slice of coconut cream cake, watch , and then go to bed. Daily Total: $0",7,245
"6:45 a.m. — I wake up to the sound of my roommate getting ready for work, so I check my phone to see what time it is. 15 minutes until my alarm. I close my eyes again and put off getting out of bed. 7:45 a.m. — I'm normally not up this early, but today's an important day – I have a job interview! I'm not very happy with my current job, so when I saw an opening at a lab recently, I jumped at the opportunity. I open my closet to choose my interview outfit. It's mid-January, yet I still decide on a button-down tucked into a pencil skirt (without tights). I guess I'll regret it later. I don't have time to make breakfast, so I buy a small latte and a blueberry scone on my way to the subway. $7.63 8:20 a.m. — I arrive to my interview a little too early, but I go in anyway. I check in with the front desk and head up to the fourth floor, where I am greeted by the smiling receptionist. I first take a medication dosage test, which I am expected to get 100% on. I do (yay), and wait until the recruiter calls me in. 9:30 a.m. — Time to head off to my interview with the nurse manager! The hospital is just a couple of blocks away from the HR building, and I have enough time, so I walk leisurely and go through interview questions in my head. 11 a.m. — I'm done! I thought the interview went well, but I try not to get my hopes up. The manager has a couple more interviews and told me that I should hear back by the end of next week. I need to pick up my student ID for school before my first day, so I take the subway down to campus. After getting my ID, I pick up lunch at my favorite Vietnamese restaurant, where I order shrimp summer rolls, a pork chop bahn mi, and a Vietnamese iced coffee. I carry all of my yummy food back home. $21.25 5:15 p.m. — Last week, I booked a SoulCycle class for today at 5:30. I'm trying to make a habit of going at least once a week, especially since I live right around the corner from one. I check into class and rent a pair of shoes, which are free because I bought a first-timer class pack! 6:15 p.m. — That class kicked my butt! I felt like throwing up during it and attributed it to being out of shape, but even when I get home, I still feel nauseous. I sit for a little bit and wait for the nausea to pass before finally hopping in the shower. 8 p.m. — No plans for me this Friday night! I curl up in bed and binge-watch on Amazon Prime until I fall asleep. Daily Total: $28.88",1,246
"6 a.m. — I wake up to the sound of the apartment door closing. My roommate is going home for the weekend and just left. Normally I would check what time it is, but I'm too lazy (and sore from SoulCycle) to bother. I drift back to sleep. 12 p.m. — Finally wake up after snoozing for hours! I have work tonight at 7 p.m., and I usually try to sleep as much as possible before my shift. I make myself avocado toast with eggs and then crawl back into bed to watch . (I bought a bag of avocados from Trader Joe's last week and they're finally ripe, so it looks like I'll probably be eating avocados daily for a the forseeable future.) 5 p.m. — The hardest part is getting myself out of bed and to work. I only work three days a week, but it's still incredibly draining. I put on my scrubs, throw my work stuff in a bag, and head out the door by 5:30. 5:45 p.m. — I always forget that subways run locally on the weekends. Luckily, I snag a seat, so I'm able to close my eyes for the 30-minute ride. 6:15 p.m. — I'm in desperate need of coffee, so I reload my Starbucks app ($15) and mobile order an iced latte to pick up. I realize that I haven't eaten since noon, so I swing by a deli near work and scoop up rice, beef, broccoli, chicken, and veggies into a small container ($9). I'm ready for my night of work! $24 Daily Total: $24",2,246
"7:30 a.m. — Freedom!!! I actually had a very calm night at work, which is pretty rare. I get my stuff from my locker and take the subway down to Trader Joe's to pick up groceries. I get fruit, a  Thai Citrus Chicken salad (I off of this salad), cereal, yogurt, snacks, and some frozen meals. Then I hop back on the subway. $27.66 8:45 a.m. — Home sweet home! I put away my groceries, kick off my scrubs, and jump in the shower. I always feel gross after a shift (who knows what germs I'm carrying around!), so I pretty much always shower as soon as I get home. I watch while eating a bowl of cereal, and then I fall asleep without realizing it. 2:30 p.m. — Thank God I had an alarm set! I probably wouldn't have woken up otherwise. I don't have work again until Wednesday, and when I usually have a couple days off, I try not to sleep too much after work because it messes with my sleep cycle. I decide to make a trip to Target to pick up school and cleaning supplies. First, though, I need my caffeine. I stop by a coffee shop and get a large iced latte ($4.50, but I have 10 drinks on my punch card, so this one's free!) and walk over to Target. 3:30 p.m. — First stop? The dollar section. Everything's so cute! I only walk away with one thing, which I'm super proud of myself for, and then set out to find the items I actually came for. I get school and cleaning supplies ($20) and more snacks ($15.43). $35.43 6:30 p.m. — I'm starving! I resist the urge to order out and instead make my own dinner: Trader Joe's frozen gnocchi plus two handfuls of spinach. I usually don't finish all of it, but I'm extra hungry today and devour the entire thing. 8 p.m. — My roommate is back! We sit around the dining table and chat/gossip for a bit before we both retire to our rooms. I fall asleep by accident again while watching . Daily Total: $63.09",3,246
"8:30 a.m. — I get out of bed after snoozing for half an hour and make myself avocado toast with a fried egg. 9:45 a.m. — I've decided to run errands and get my life together today. I dress in workout clothes just in case I don't have time to stop back home before my SoulCycle class at 12:15. I head over to the post office, which happens to be next door to my apartment, to send back my Stitch Fix order. I really loved a pair of jeans that I received, but after much debate have decided not to keep them. After the post office, I grab a skim latte. $4.50 10:30 a.m. — I'm blessed (or cursed?) to live just a short walk away from Marshalls, so I head over. The pair of tights I'm wearing right now has a hole in the thigh area, and I've been meaning to replace them. Coincidentally, there's a sale on workout clothes! I fall in love with a pair of Reebok cropped leggings, so I get two pairs in different prints ($29.98). I check out the home goods section and find a lovely rose quartz-scented candle ($3.44). At checkout, the cashier asks if I want to donate a dollar to the children's hospital. Why not? $34.42 11:15 a.m. — I still have  time before my SoulCycle class, so I head back to my apartment and change into a pair of my brand new leggings! They feel so nice and stretchy – definitely worth it. 12 p.m. — I arrive at my SoulCycle class and rent a pair of cycling shoes ($3). I grab a set of ear plugs (my ears were ringing for hours after class last time due to the loud music) and stretch. The theme of today's class is “The Evolution of Rihanna,” so I'm pumped! $3 1 p.m. — I have a major crush on the instructor, but I think he might be gay. Oh well. For lunch, I decide to get a smoothie from this little stand a couple of blocks away. I order a large chocolate, peanut butter, banana, and protein smoothie and then relax on a bench at the plaza around the corner. I text my friend about my crush on the Soul Cycle instructor, and he instantly finds the instructor on Instagram. I stalk him for a little and come to the conclusion that he's definitely gay. Story of my life. $6 2 p.m. — Ugh, laundry time. I've put it off for too long. Luckily, I have a laundry room in my apartment building, which is rare for NYC apartments. I decide to wash my sheets too, so I do two separate loads. $10.60 4:45 p.m. — My laundry is all dry and folded! I lay in bed and browse Buzzfeed until I get hungry. 6 p.m. — I make myself a large pot of pesto pasta with chicken and lots of broccoli and asparagus. I'm not a very good cook and therefore don't cook a lot, but eating out gets expensive! I spoon out a generous portion and then refrigerate the rest for tomorrow. 8 p.m. — I force myself to wash the dishes and then crawl into bed. Instead of watching , I decide to read. I started back in December and am more than 75% finished with it, but haven't picked it back up in a few weeks. My goal is to read one book every month in 2018 (a goal I accomplished in 2017), and I know it'll get more difficult to find free time to read once school starts. Better get started now! I read until about midnight and fall asleep. Daily Total: $58.52",4,246
"8:30 a.m. — My alarms failed to go off this morning, but I swore I set three yesterday? I have my first day of graduate school today, but my classes aren't until late afternoon. I decide to lounge around in bed until lunchtime. I eat a bowl of cereal for breakfast and spend the morning reading the news on my iPad and finishing First book of 2018 is complete! 12 p.m. — Lunchtime! I heat up the rest of my pesto pasta from dinner yesterday and eat a generous serving. I never know how much pasta to cook and feel like I always end up making enough to feed a small village. 1 p.m. — Even though my first class doesn't start until 4:55, I decide to go to my school's library to print out lecture slides. (Printing costs are covered through school.) It's uncharacteristically warm today (high 50s), and I'm sweating under my thick cardigan. I swear my body temperature is 20 degrees warmer than the average human's. 2 p.m. — I've printed and stapled my lecture slides and decide to get coffee before class. I received an email from Gregory's Coffee, where I'm a rewards member, for $2 off any drink today, so I guess I know where I'm going! I decide to walk because it's nice outside, and it takes me about 20 minutes. I order a large cold brew ($2.32, thanks to the coupon!) and kill some time there. $2.32 3:30 p.m. — Oops, looks like I have to purchase an online book for my Statistics class. There goes $45. I also browse Amazon and end up buying a couple of things: an umbrella (mine has been broken for weeks and I've been borrowing my roommate's), a binder, a 3-hole punch, highlighters, binder tabs, and a screen protector for my iPad. $106.97 4:30 p.m. — Time to get to class! It starts pouring as I begin my 10-minute walk, but luckily I have my roommate's umbrella! 9:15 p.m. — Done with my first day of graduate school! I had Research in Nursing first and then Statistics. My brain is fried! All I can think about is food. As I'm waiting for the subway, my friend texts me and asks how it went. She's also in my grad program, but missed class today because of an emergency. We make plans to meet up on Thursday for coffee so that she can tell me what happened (she says it's CRAZY), and I offer to go over notes with her as well. 10:05 p.m. — It takes forever to get home because the trains are delayed. I eat a Trader Joe's pre-packaged salad and fruit while I go over tonight's Statistics lecture. 11 p.m. — I add a couple of events to my iCal, update my to-do list (I have homework already!), and call it a night. I'm exhausted! By the time I fall asleep, it's almost 1 a.m. Daily Total: $109.29",5,246
"10 a.m. — I wake up feeling pretty groggy – I'm still feeling the effects of being in class for so long yesterday. I lay in bed a little bit longer and then get up to make myself avocado toast with two fried eggs. 12 p.m. — For some reason, I'm still feeling really sleepy, so I take a nap. 3 p.m. — I wake up from my nap confused by a dream that I had in which I had a chest tube! (I work on a floor of the hospital where a lot of post-surgical patients have chest tubes.) I guess that's my body's way of telling me that I don't want to go to work! I get out of bed, shower, and whip up a quick dinner using Trader Joe's frozen mushroom risotto. 6:15 p.m. — I mobile order a venti iced latte from Starbucks on my way to work using my Starbucks app. I still have money on it from the $15 I reloaded a couple of days ago, so it technically doesn't cost me anything. 7:30 p.m. — Ugh, nights like tonight make me remember why I'm trying to find a new job. Just hoping that the night goes fast and no one dies. Including me. Daily Total: $0",6,246
"7:30 a.m. — I fly out of work the minute I finish my report. I have lunch plans at noon with a friend who I haven't seen in over a year, so I hustle back home as quick as possible. 8:10 a.m. — I'm home earlier than usual! I hop in the shower, dry my hair, and fall asleep within seconds. 11:35 a.m. — My alarm goes off, and I realize I'm running late! Luckily, my friend messages me on Facebook to say she'd be a couple of minutes late herself. Perfect! I quickly get ready, throw on an oversized sweater and leggings, and run out the door. We're meeting at a vegan restaurant near campus, and I make it there within 20 minutes. 12:10 p.m. — My friend gets there first and saves us a table. I'm starving by the time I arrive and already know exactly what I'm going to order. We both get the Spicy Thai Salad with a side of sweet potato fries – YUM. We spend the next hour catching up and chowing down our delicious food. $17.64 1:30 p.m. — After lunch, we head to the university bookstore, where I get my coworker and I reusable water bottles. (I had told her I would pick one up for her.) The total is $45.73, and she Venmos me $16 for hers. $29.73 2 p.m. — My friend and I go our separate ways. I decide I need coffee because I'm running on two and a half hours of sleep and use the remainder of the money on my Starbucks app to buy a grande iced coffee. I head to the library to kill some time and also to pee. 3:30 p.m. — I meet up with my friend (the one who missed the first day of grad school classes) for coffee. I get a medium skim latte and listen to her absolutely insane story, which has to do with a crazy former roommate. Then we go over the Statistics homework. $4.50 6:15 p.m. — Running on less than three hours of sleep is starting to get to me, so I head back home. I debate ordering takeout, but my apartment complex has free food today in the lounge! (Every couple of months, my building has ""Resident Appreciation Day,"" where there's free food from a different vendor). I decide to go up to the lounge to check it out. Today is BBQ! I get a brisket sandwich with pickles and a side of coleslaw. Though I still secretly want Chinese takeout, I convince myself that free BBQ is pretty awesome too. 8:45 p.m. — My roommate and I decide that we're both craving bubble tea. We live dangerously close to a bubble tea chain, so we bundle up and make the short trek. I get a medium passionfruit green tea with bubbles and happily slurp my way home. $4.75 11 p.m. — I don't think I can keep my eyes open any longer. Zzzzz. Daily Total: $56.62",7,246
"8 a.m. — Wake up to let the dogs outside. My parents are away this weekend, so my younger sister and I are dog sitting for them. I contemplate waking up my sister, E.*, to get coffee, but fear the teenage anger that will come of it. Instead, I turn on garbage TV and scroll through social media. 9:30 a.m. — I can't wait any longer. I reluctantly wake up E., who is in surprisingly good spirits, and she agrees to go with me. We drive to Dutch Bros. (not my first pick when it comes to coffee, but it will do) and I order a small latte with Irish cream and an extra shot of espresso. She gets a blended, flavored energy drink. We have a full punch card good for a free drink and get both drinks for the price of one. $7 12 p.m. — I need to get jeans that actually fit me and E. just started a new job and wants to update her closet, so we decide to go shopping. I end up getting a pair of jeans, a pair of cute shorts, and a new pair of sunglasses. E. gives me one of her coupons and the total is only $33! I know I should stop spending, but we go into Nordstrom too and I end up leaving with a great pair of Jack Rogers booties on super sale and velvet pajama shorts just because ($65). $98 2 p.m. — We worked up an appetite shopping and stop at one of our favorite sushi places for lunch. We share a couple of plates and I have a hot tea. Being the older sister, I always seem to pick up the check, but I really enjoy spending time with E. $22 6 p.m. — E. is going out with her boyfriend tonight and I have plans later, but I go for another round of retail therapy to pass the time. I reason with myself that going through this separation from my wife has been very hard on me, and shopping for clothes that fit is way better than drinking or another coping mechanism. I find another pair of shorts and a sports bra and call it a win. $35 7:30 p.m. — I meet my brother-in-law's girlfriend for drinks at one of my favorite bars. We both order pomegranate ciders and share an order of Cajun tots. We talk about my separation and the family. It's been so hard but my in-laws are incredible. After talking and crying for a while, I pick up the tab. $22 10 p.m. — Get home and am ready to crash. I let the dogs out, put them to bed, and hit the pillow hard. Daily Total: $184",1,247
"9 a.m. — This is seriously sleeping in for me. I rarely sleep past 8 anymore. I get up, let the dogs out, and start a load of laundry before waking up E. 9:30 a.m. — We drive to Starbucks and I order a triple-grande latte and E. gets a black iced tea and a bacon breakfast sandwich. I pay again. $11 10:30 a.m. — I start another load of laundry and mentally prepare for my week. I make a list of groceries I need to get and plan my meals. My stomach has been very sensitive lately so I have been focusing on eating quality protein and produce. 12 p.m. — E. coaches a youth volleyball team, so she leaves for practice and I head out to the grocery store. First stop: Trader Joe's. I grab spinach, hard-boiled eggs, apples, dried mango, and breakfast trek mix ($12). Next I stop at Costco for a rotisserie chicken and a whole pepperoni pizza from the food court per E.'s request ($15). $27 5:30 p.m. — E. and I snack a ton throughout the day and are not that hungry for a full dinner. I eat a slice of pizza and she makes Top Ramen. We lounge on the couch while I look online for more clothes as well as housewares. I recently moved into a new apartment, so buying home decor has been fun and distracting for me. I end up putting a bunch of things in my cart but don't pull the trigger yet. Typical. 8:30 p.m. — I pack all my stuff from staying at my parents' house and head back to my apartment to unload before running out to pick them up from the airport. 11 p.m. — Finally back in my own bed and already thinking about buying a coffee in the morning. I am an old lady at heart and this is way past my bedtime, especially when I have to be up for work early tomorrow. Daily Total: $38",2,247
"6:30 a.m. — Finally roll out of bed after pushing snooze twice – I knew it was going to be a rough morning. I jump in the shower, get dressed, and pack shredded chicken, an apple and trek mix for my lunch. I'm out of the door by 7. My ability to get ready so quickly is a super power. 7:20 a.m. — I resist the urge to stop at my favorite coffee shop near my office and instead go to the grocery store to stock the office coffee supply. I buy creamer, two packs of coffee pods, a bottle of water, and more forks on my company credit card. I get to the office by 7:30 and organize our coffee supplies before sitting down at my desk. ($22 expensed) 9 a.m. — I go through emails and get organized while drinking two cups of (free) office coffee. I have a feeling this week is going to be very long. The owner of the company comes in and talks my ear off about his weekend. I really like him — plus our conversations usually eat up a good hour of my day, which I am totally okay with. He tells me about a conference he would like me to go to later this year. I do some research, find a great deal on airfare, and use the conference group rate to book my hotel. ($425 expensed) 4 p.m. — Wow, what a Monday! Today kicked my butt and I could not be more ready to head home. One of my favorite parts of my job is the hours. Getting off at 4 makes it feel like I have plenty of time to accomplish things after work. I pack up my stuff, starving and sleepy from the long day. 5:30 p.m. — I get home and unpack everything from my weekend. Then I fix a spinach salad with shredded chicken. For the life of me, I cannot get my new salad dressing bottle open, so I settle for olive oil and soy sauce and it is delicious! I eat my salad on the couch and catch up on TV. 8 p.m. — I'm exhausted and starting not to feel too good. I jump in the shower (I don't like blow-drying my hair, so I normally shower at night), wash my face, and jump right in bed. I watch on repeat to fall asleep. Daily Total: $0",3,247
"6:30 a.m. — Snooze my alarm twice. (I set my alarm way too early so I can snooze it and lay in bed longer, which I know makes no sense.) I get out of bed, do my hair and makeup, throw on clothes, and head out the door. My office is pretty casual, which I am so thankful for. If I had to dress up every day, I would be a very cranky person. 7:30 a.m. — It's super foggy this morning, and everyone in the Pacific Northwest forgets how to drive when there is fog (or rain or, heaven forbid, snow). My commute is a little longer today but I cave and stop at my favorite coffee shop. Their espresso is so smooth and delicious. I get a triple latte with one raw sugar. $4.25 11:30 a.m. — Things are super slow in the office, which is bizarre since we are having the best Q1 we've had since I've been here. I'm getting antsy and hungry, so I go to Subway for lunch to get out of the office. I get a foot-long turkey sandwich with lots of veggies and have every intention of saving half for tomorrow's lunch. $7.50 11:45 a.m. — As I walk out to my car, I notice how dirty it is. Ever since I bought it last summer, I have been obsessed with taking good care of it. I go through the quick car wash and then go back to work, where I grab an apricot LaCroix (my favorite). $8 3 p.m. — I finish up the application for my health insurance plan and pay the first month's premium, which I will be reimbursed for. Then I pack up my stuff and head home. ($313 expensed) 5 p.m. — I do a core workout in my living room and watch , which kind of feels like torture even though I enjoy it. I eat the other half of my sandwich from today's lunch for dinner. 6 p.m. — I'm meeting my wife so that we can do our taxes together, and I am a total ball of nerves. We haven't seen each other in two weeks and it has been so hard. She's been staying with her parents, so we meet at their house and sit at the dining room table. We have a decent conversation but I can tell that she is getting antsy, so I head out. I feel hopeful for our future and that we can start to turn things around. I pay the fee to file and direct deposit our taxes. $69.99 8 p.m. — I go to my parents' house to pick up two packages I sent there. It's nice to see my family but they always ask about my wife and how it's going, which is really difficult. I grab my packages and go back to my house. The grocery store by my parents' house is the only place I have seen apricot LaCroix in the larger boxes, so I stop in and grab a box to restock my fridge. $4 9:30 p.m. — Finally home. I do my normal nightly routine and go right to sleep. Daily Total: $93.74",4,247
"6:45 a.m. — After waking up throughout the night, I am exhausted and have a terrible migraine. I lay in bed for way too long while I contemplate working from home, but I feel like I need to suck it up and go into the office. I rush to get ready and leave by 7:10. 7:30 a.m. — I need the coffee this morning. I brew a cup at the office but put in too much creamer, so it's kind of gross. Again, not very many emails and not a lot of big projects going on, so I know it's going to be a long day. 1 p.m. — Someone ordered pizza and I grab a slice and eat at my desk with a LaCroix while I scroll through social media. My birthday is next week, so I confirm my family dinner reservation. 4 p.m. — On my way home from work, I realize my gas is getting pretty low so I stop to fill up. Costco gas is 20 cents cheaper per gallon than the gas at any other place around, so waiting a little longer seems worth it. $26.70 5 p.m. — Watch college basketball, start a load of laundry, and relax a little bit. During halftime, I sauté spinach and chicken and top it with Alfredo sauce. It's delicious and I have enough to take to work tomorrow. 7:30 p.m. — I jump in the shower and do my nightly routine before watching the new episode of and heading to bed. Daily Total: $26.70",5,247
"6:30 a.m. — I'm surprisingly awake and in good spirits — maybe because it's Friday? Get ready for the day, pack my lunch and clothes for the weekend (I'm housesitting for a family friend), and turn off all the lights and the heaters since I won't be back until Sunday. 7:10 a.m. — My commute is a breeze this morning; it seems like Fridays and Mondays are always less congested, which is nice. I get off the freeway with plenty of time, so I go through the Starbucks drive-through. I would much rather have coffee from my favorite place right around the corner, but this way I don't have to get out of my car. I order a triple latte and a bagel to munch on at my desk. $7.20 12 p.m. — Take my lunch break and drive over to the house I'm staying at this weekend to check on the dogs and drop off my stuff. Once I'm back at the office, I go through emails and eat my leftover spinach and chicken. The rest of the day is pretty much a dud, so I hope I can get out of here a little early and run errands before heading back to the dogs. 3 p.m. — Freedom! Even if it's an hour early, I will take it. I leave the office and go to the store to return a couple of items I don't like enough to keep. I leave with some other items too, of course, and spend an extra $30. Before going to the house, I stop at Target to pick up thank-you cards. I also grab car air fresheners (black ice is the OG), a charcoal clay mask cleanser, a couple of makeup brushes, and an eyeshadow pallet (I don't even wear eyeshadow but it's on sale and this is Target). Only $22 in damage – not bad if you ask me. $52 7 p.m. — After wrestling the dogs and catching up on garbage television, I make a quick salad and a cup of hot chamomile tea and settle in for the night. 10 p.m. — These dogs are on the tightest schedule – it's kind of insane. I let them out for the last time before putting them and myself to bed. Daily Total: $59.20",6,247
"8 a.m. — I take the day off to reboot and refocus. 10 a.m. — Pick up coffee for a friend and me before heading over to their house. $9.80 11 a.m. — We head up to a winery with beautiful views. We are so lucky to live in a place with random gorgeous days like this one in the middle of winter. We both do a tasting flight ($20) and then order a magnum bottle of rosé to celebrate my birthday. We split the bill and tip. $50 1:30 p.m. — We are starved and decide on Thai food. I have been craving pad see ew and am so excited. We split the bill again. $18 4 p.m. — I had some other things I wanted to accomplish today, but I am exhausted and honestly a little tipsy from all our wine earlier in the day. I decide to hang out with my family for a bit before calling it in early. 8 p.m. — Still exhausted and fighting a nasty wine headache, so I decide to give in for the night. I end up binge watching old episodes before falling asleep. Daily Total: $77.80",7,247
"6:15 a.m. — My alarm goes off much later than usual. I don't need to get in until 8 a.m. (instead of my usual 7 a.m. arrival time) because I'm going climbing tonight after work and will stay later than usual at the office. We work flexible hours, and as long as I get my nine hours in every day, no one really cares what time I come in or leave. 7:45 a.m. — Get to work and find a chocolate-chip muffin scone in the break room! I bring my lunch every day and don't usually eat breakfast, but I'm not one to refuse free food. I take it back to my desk and eat it with the coffee I brought from home. 12:15 p.m. — Take a break from working (and IM-ing my friends) to warm up the beef stew I brought from home. I prepared a huge crock-pot of it on Sunday and have been eating my way through it this week. I don't meal prep per se, especially because I get bored of the same meals after so many days, but I do occasionally make large batches of things. One more day left! 1:30 p.m. — The friend I'm supposed to go climbing with tonight shoots me an IM that he's been sneezing all morning and might have to bail. Bummer. Clearly, some sort of illness has been spreading around the office. I think about the Mucinex in my purse (since I've also been sick the past few days), but decide to wait until later to take my next dosage. 4:45 p.m. — I am outta here! My climbing partner officially bails, but I go anyway to get time on the hangboards and tension board. 7:20 p.m. — Home from the gym and I am starving! My roommates beat me home and to the stove and I'm sadly stuck devouring goat cheese and beet crackers until they finish cooking. 7:45 p.m. — Find a leftover quinoa, tofu, tomato, and cucumber mixture in the back of my fridge that probably needs to be eaten soon. I throw it on the stove and make a stir-fry with leftover bacon grease from my roommate's dinner (LOL, super healthy) and coconut aminos mixed in. I sit down on the couch to enjoy my strange concoction. 9 p.m. — Time for ! I watch Queen Viola Davis slay, as per usual, and then shower and go to sleep. Lights out around 10:30. Daily Total: $0",1,248
"5:30 a.m. — Alarm goes off way too early, but at least it's Friday! I snooze a few times before finally getting out of bed to get ready for the day. Brush my teeth, wash my face, and then grab my thermos full of coffee. I'm out the door at 6:30 for my 30-minute commute. 7 a.m. — Sadly, there's no free food in the break room today. I settle in to read emails and daydream about the weekend. 11:10 a.m. — I succumb to my hunger and warm up the last of my beef stew. 12 p.m. — Finally hear back from a boy I've gone on a few dates with, L.*, about whether he's free to hang out on Saturday. He's not, and I'm somewhat annoyed. He has poor texting skills, and we barely communicate at all outside of our dates. I channel my annoyance into finally setting up a date with the other guy I've been messaging, B.*, who suggested that we see a horror movie together sometime. I research tomorrow's movie times at the theater near me and send him suggestions. 3 p.m. — It's officially the weekend! I basically sprint out of the building to my car. I am very ready to be sitting on my couch, but first, I need to stop at Party City to pick up decorations for our Super Bowl party this weekend! 3:30 p.m. — After some playful banter with a Patriots fan, I escape Party City without doing too much damage. I get plates, napkins, and a tablecloth. $16.91 5:45 p.m. — All my roommates are home, so we start cooking our HelloFresh meal. A friend of mine from college periodically gives us her free boxes, and tonight it's turkey pesto burgers. They turn out delicious, and it is always fun to share a dinner with all four of my roommates. 8:30 p.m. — One of my roommates and I settle down on the couch to watch We want to see the new one when it comes out in theaters, so we have to catch up on the previous ones. When it ends, we put on , and my roomie comments on how I moan more about Guy Fieri and his food than I did over Christian Grey. 11 p.m. — Finally go to sleep. Daily Total: $16.91",2,248
"7 a.m. — Up early! I have a lot of errands to run today, and I want to get a quick climb beforehand. My partner bails but since I'm already awake, I decide to go anyway. 10 a.m. — I am exhausted after about an hour on the tension boards. I still have time to kill before my eye doctor appointment, so I run to Starbucks for a cold brew and a breakfast sandwich. The total comes to $8.93, but I pay with my preloaded Gold card. It's absolutely gorgeous out, so I sit on the patio. 10:40 a.m. — Next stop: eye doctor. I escape mostly unscathed. I pay $91 from my HSA for the contact fitting and optomap, and another $121.20 out of pocket for my contact lenses. (I don't have enough money in my HSA to cover both.) I have a $100 rebate on the contacts, which brings that total down to $21, and I will eventually reimburse myself via my HSA! $112.20 11:15 a.m. — Next, I hop over to Trader Joe's to buy ingredients for my Super Bowl wings, including soy sauce, pickled jalapeños, sriracha, balsamic vinegar, honey, and brown sugar, and then some things for myself: green juice, half and half, mandarin oranges, cheddar rockets, granola bars, cookies, and frozen chicken tikka samosas. $40.07 12 p.m. — I head to Sam's Club to buy frozen wings but decide that a 10-pound bag is way more than I need. I go to Walmart instead where I get two bags (eight pounds total), blue cheese dressing, and sesame seeds. $26.80 6:30 p.m. — I never hear back from B. about our potential date (which is amusing, considering he was the one who put the most effort into keeping our conversation going). My roomie and I join some friends for all-you-can-eat sushi and we gorge ourselves. One friend pays and we all pay him back on Venmo. Even though we had grand plans of going out downtown, after I get home, all I can bring myself to do is lay on the couch until bedtime. $33 Daily Total: $212.07",3,248
"9 a.m. — I wake up feeling incredibly rejuvenated. Today is the Super Bowl! I make my way upstairs to get some coffee and prepare my wings for the crockpot. 10:30 a.m. — I'm a little hungry, so I make myself toast with cream cheese and a “man-mosa” made from Coors Banquet and orange juice. 1 p.m. — One roommate and I and get a six-pack of Dogfish Head 60 Minute IPA for the party. $12.93 4 p.m. — People start arriving! We have an absurd amount of food, so everyone fills up plates and settles in to watch the game. 8:30 p.m. — The Eagles win and I am ecstatic. Having grown up in Maryland, I am a diehard Baltimore Ravens fan, but I will happily root for anyone to beat the Patriots. My friend from Boston storms out of our house but everyone else seems to have a great time. We are left with lots of leftovers, which is good because I didn't buy a lot of lunch food for the week. 9:30 p.m. — Take a quick shower and get in bed by 10 p.m. Daily Total: $12.93",4,248
"5:30 a.m. — Alarm goes off. I snooze for a little bit before performing my usual routine: brush teeth, wash face, grab lunch and coffee, and leave by 6:30. 7 a.m. — Get to my desk and the first thing I do is log in to pay my credit card bill for the month. I split most of my expenses between two different cards, and I typically end up with a statement balance between $500 and $600 on each. 11 a.m. — I've already eaten my apple and the leftover quesadilla I brought to work. Luckily, I still have wings and other snacks but I'm thinking today is going to be a long, hungry day. 4 p.m. — Escape work and head home to devour as many Super Bowl leftovers as I can before my class at the climbing gym tonight. I eat a leftover grilled cheese, hummus, and too many hot Cheetos. 6:10 p.m. — Fill up on gas on my way to the gym. My SUV has a 22.5-gallon tank, so filling up is always a little pricey. $39.01 6:30 p.m. — I signed up for the sport lead climbing class about a month ago and it is finally happening! It feels good to be finally taking it — I've wanted to take this class forever but I broke my ankle about a year ago and that really set back my climbing abilities. Because I am a gym member, I get a discounted price for the class. $39 10:30 p.m. — Finally home after the three-and-a-half-hour class. It went super well but now I'm exhausted. I find a box of pizza on the counter and steal a slice before making my way downstairs to shower and go to bed. Daily Total: $78.01",5,248
"5:30 a.m. — Ugh. I'm up way too early for how late I stayed up last night. I'm scheduled to be on shift in the test lab today, so I have to be at work at 7 a.m. I muster up the energy to get out of bed and get my day going. 7 a.m. — Make my way to the lab this morning instead of my usual building. Lab shifts are a nice break from my usual day-to-day desk work. (It's not as great when said shifts are during nights or weekends, though.) 10:45 a.m. — Our test this morning doesn't take the whole shift, so I pack up my things and jump in my car to drive back to my usual building. I didn't get the chance to snack at all this morning and I'm ravenous. I eat a leftover grilled cheese sandwich while catching up on emails. 12 p.m. — I see an email from the automatic job search I set up within my company. I love my current job, but I have long said that if this job became available, I would definitely apply. I get an immediate wave of panic-induced adrenaline and manage to update my résumé and pump out a cover letter within the next hour. I send my manager an email telling him about the position, too. I hope he approves and is willing to help me through the process! 2:30 p.m. — I'm craving Diet Coke but the vending machine won't take my credit card for some reason. Sadly, I have no cash and my craving has to go unsatisfied. 4 p.m. — Head home and eat way too many Super Bowl leftovers. I feel like I've been insatiable since the party. While sitting on the couch swiping, I see that Bumble is offering a week-long free trial of their Bumble Boost subscription. I decide to sign up. Hopefully, I'll remember to cancel this in a week before they charge me for the one-month subscription. I add a reminder to my Google Calendar just in case. 7:15 p.m. — All my roomies are home, so we watch last night's episode of . Thank God he finally got rid of Krystal! 9:30 p.m. — Bedtime.

"6:30 a.m. — Alarm goes off, and OMG I feel great. I sleep in an extra hour today because I'm going climbing tonight at 5:30 again. It is amazing how much better that extra hour makes me feel. 7:20 a.m. — It's Double-Star Day at Starbucks, so obviously, I have to get my points. I get a venti skinny vanilla latte for $5.12 and pay with my preloaded Gold card. 2 p.m. — Finally get a text back from B. — almost a week later. Apparently, he just disappears on the weekends? He asks if I want to do something this weekend, and I say yes. 5 p.m. — Leave work and head to the gym. 7:15 p.m. — Back home, where I warm up leftover grilled cheeses for dinner and then eat them in the living room while chatting with my roommate about boys and Valentine's Day plans. 9:30 p.m. — Bedtime! So glad that tomorrow is the last day of my work week. Daily Total: $0",7,248
"7:30 a.m. — It's Saturday, but thanks to my internal alarm clock, I wake up earlier than I want to. I catch my cat munching on my already struggling plant (it's nontoxic to cats, I've already Googled) and while trying to swat him away, I end up knocking over the plant. The pot breaks and my cat doesn't look guilty at all. 8:20 a.m. — I sweep up the mess and the rest of my room while I'm at it, then toast a bagel for breakfast. 9:20 a.m. — Spend too long searching for ways to prevent my cat from making my plants his personal buffet and then browse Reddit before I study! I have my board exams in three months so I'm cracking down now by doing as many practice tests as possible. 12:20 p.m. —I'm not as productive as I want to be and I reheat a slice of pizza from earlier this week and eat it with raspberries. I head out to the local plant nursery and buy a pot for a plant stand I have at home, plus a cute cactus. $23.10 2:10 p.m. — Stop by Trader Joe's, where my sweet tooth takes over. I buy a chocolate cake and frozen macarons, as well as a bagged salad, frozen veggies, mango slices, bananas, and an almond butter and turmeric salad dressing I'm excited to try. I drop off the groceries at home, grab my book bag, and head back out. $24.51 2:50 p.m. — I haven't wheel thrown anything in weeks and I make my way to the ceramic studio and pay to get early access before the class session officially starts. $7.50 5:10 p.m. — I make a couple of coffee pour overs because they are popular in my Etsy shop, plus some vases for fun. Then, I go to the library, where I can hopefully focus on studying. 8 p.m. — Starving, I go home and eat General Tso's chicken with bok choy I made yesterday. (I love leftovers.) I chat with my roommates in the kitchen while eating macarons. 10 p.m. — Do another practice test while my cat snuggles on my lap. Pass out at midnight. Daily Total: $55.11",1,249
"8 a.m. —  Wake up and make a bowl of cereal. I bask in the morning sunlight for a bit because my room has huge windows, and then focus my attention on churning through flashcards. 12:30 p.m. — K.*, the man I'm dating, comes over; we planned to go hiking and I need a study break. We make a packed lunch with selections from the hot food section at the grocery store. Unfortunately for my wallet, that area is located next to the bakery and drinks. I also buy a cookie and sparkling energy waters that are on sale. $21 2 p.m. — We catch up on new episodes of my favorite podcasts, and during the drive. K. pays the park entrance fee and we have a good hike that ends at a lighthouse. 5 p.m. — Get home and watch an episode of with K. while we hang out. 7 p.m. — K. leaves because I'm feeling guilty about not studying. Thankfully, tomorrow is a holiday, so I don't have school and can catch up. Dinner is lunch leftovers and cherries because I'm too tired to cook. 9:30 p.m. — Roommates and friends want to have a bonfire! We gather blankets and feast on s'mores — so much for being productive! Daily Total: $21",2,249
"7:30 a.m. — Wake up and spend too much time in bed scrolling through Instagram. I eat a breakfast of frozen waffles (because I'm a child) and a banana while watching review videos on the current block we're studying in class. 12:30 p.m. — Lunch is chicken leftovers with the new salad dressing  — it's A+; would recommend. 2:30 p.m. — Finish another flashcard deck and head over to the pottery studio. My pieces are semi-dry and ready to be trimmed and fired for their first time in the kiln! 5 p.m. — I trim and throw a few big, bottle-shaped vases I'm really proud of. Then I go to school for a few hours of undistracted studying. 8 p.m. — Head home so that I can cook my first Blue Apron meal of the week. Blue Apron is super convenient and the ingredients and recipes are always interesting, plus it saves me the process of planning a grocery list for only one person. Tonight, I'm making Mexican-spiced barramundi with a kale, sweet potato, and an avocado salad. 12:30 a.m. — Check my school calendar before passing out. Turns out I have no required classes for tomorrow, so it's gonna be another studying-in-leggings type of day! I make a to-do list so that I'm more productive than I was over the long weekend. Daily Total: $0",3,249
"7:30 a.m. — Wake up to my cat stomping all over me. We walk to the kitchen for breakfast and I make a chia smoothie bowl with loads of strawberries, coconut shreds, and almonds. 12 p.m. — Finish reviewing another practice test and start tackling my to-do list. I send a couple of emails and then take pictures of my new ceramic pieces for my Etsy shop. I spend my lunch break editing pictures and posting them while eating leftovers from last night. 2:30 p.m. — Back to flashcards, made more exciting this time with the addition of a sparkling water energy drink. 5 p.m. — I'm feeling stir crazy and go on a bike ride for a change of scenery. I spin around my neighborhood and stop by CVS to pick up hydrating Korean face masks. I went to the dermatologist for the first time ever a few weeks ago, and my skin is still getting used to the retinoids. $9.62 8 p.m.  — I take a break from studying to eat dinner — more of the Trader Joe's salad and gyoza I found in my freezer. The rest of the night consists of (you guessed it!) studying the recorded lectures from the morning and dancing with my cat to a particularly good Discover Weekly playlist on Spotify. Daily Total: $9.62",4,249
"8 p.m. — Chia pudding bowl for breakfast, then the usual procrastinate-and-study routine. I watch lectures from the comfort of my home but will need to go to school for a standardized patient exam to test my clinical skills. I change out of my comfy clothes for the first time this week for a more professional get-up. 1 p.m. — Lunch is the last of my barramundi leftovers. I go to FedEx to get my picture printed and then to my school's international affairs office to renew my passport. I have a couple of weeks off after my board exam and I am using that time to travel abroad with my family. The passport process is an inconvenient nightmare: My picture was printed on the wrong paper and I have to buy a money order because the office doesn't take cards. Thankfully, my father says he'll pay some of the passport fees. $135 4 p.m. — Time for my clinical skills exam! The ""patient"" is coming in for a follow-up on their chronic hypertension. As a second-year student, I should have a handle on things, but I still struggle with interpreting an EKG! 6:30 p.m. — Get started on dinner, a brussels sprout and pearl couscous salad with harissa frying cheese. It's delicious and hopefully balances out the slice of chocolate cake I eat afterward. 7 p.m. — K. comes over and we catch up on our weeks, discuss the news, and watch Netflix before he leaves so that I can get some reading in. 11 p.m. — I don't get much done because I'm exhausted. I plan an outfit for tomorrow and pass out. Daily Total: $135",5,249
"8 a.m. — Wake up and do household chores while my bagel toasts. I spend the morning researching public health statistics because today I'm going to the Capitol building to lobby for a bill expanding needle exchange facilities statewide. It's a topic I'm passionate about because I used to be an HIV tester before starting school. It's really unfortunate that the state cut even more funding for public health programs last year. 10:30 a.m. — Unbeknownst to me, I accidentally get on an express elevator and it shoots me up more than 20 floors in a matter of seconds. I survive the tower of terror, go to the correct floor, and arrive just in time for the press conference. It is inspiring seeing all the lawmakers, medical students, and pharmacists who are here supporting the bill! After the conference, I tag along with a group of medical students to lobby. We spend more time navigating the hallways than speaking to aides and legislators, but it still is a good experience. 12 p.m. — Head to school, where I eat my leftovers from last night. I try to buy tickets to see Ira Glass speak in a couple of weeks but the affordable student tickets are sold out. I kick myself for not getting them sooner. 2 p.m. — In my mandatory small group meeting, where we discuss patient cases relating to hematology and oncology with a doctor facilitator. Afterward, I go to the library to study. 8:30 p.m. — It's late and I'm too hungry to cook. My only remaining motivation is to order tacos from my favorite place near school. When I drive up, the place is unlit with a note saying they've permanently closed! The classmates in my group chat share my sorrow, and I begrudgingly go across the street for a Chick-fil-A sandwich. $5.68 10:50 p.m. — I halfheartedly do some flashcards and spend the rest of the night catching up on news, Instagram, and dumb YouTube videos while slathering on a clay face mask. Daily Total: $5.68",6,249
"7:30 a.m. — Breakfast is cereal with a banana. I spend the morning snuggled in bed with my cat, watching review videos for my upcoming exam next week because I'm starting to feel the pressure! I check my credit card and my Blue Apron box for next week gets charged. 11 a.m. —  I go to school for a lunch-and-learn about minorities in medicine. I love these events because, as a student, I am always down for free food, and the speakers are usually really interesting. Today is no exception: the speaker talks about his personal experiences as a minority physician training in orthopedic surgery in the South. I relate to a lot of the stories he shares. 4:30 p.m. — Head over to USPS right before closing time to drop off some Etsy orders and then head to Publix for fruit, iced coffee, bread, and hand lotion. $24.30 7 p.m. — Thanks to Blue Apron, I make a ginger-marinated steak with bok choy in less than an hour. I complain to K. about not feeling up to socializing tonight because I'm so stressed about studying, but I make plans for tomorrow to go to Cascades Park and a brewery with classmates so that I don't become too much of a shut-in. 8 p.m. — Finish my self-pity party and then have a bathtub soak, do my extensive nighttime face cleanse routine, and light a nice candle. (To be honest, I like my Mrs. Meyer's cheap candles best!) I get through today's lectures while listening to Spotify to keep me pumped, and then crash at midnight. Daily Total: $24.30",7,249
"8 a.m. — I wake up to my partner calling me for our morning call. I'm terrible at waking up and have once (or twice…) missed an important work meeting due to sleeping in, so my partner has started calling me in the mornings before work. 8:30 a.m. — I make sure I look fairly presentable for work in the office bathroom and then grab a coffee and a nectarine from the café. (All the food on campus at my workplace is free.) When I get back to my desk, I start looking into nearby animal sanctuaries to visit for Presidents' Day with my partner since we both have the day off. 10:30 a.m. — Sell my old rice cooker to a coworker for $60. I couldn't bear to part with it after I moved into my car but it's been collecting dust ever since. 12 p.m. — My partner emails me a link to an article about Ariana Grande visiting PreetiRang Sanctuary, so we're both sold on visiting there. I send the sanctuary a tour request and cross my fingers! 1 p.m. — I donate $500 to Figure Skating in Harlem, an organization for girls of color, and their sister program, Figure Skating in Detroit, as part of my skating-themed money experiment for this month. I skated when I was younger, and it wasn't until I took up figure skating as an adult (and had to pay for my own skates and lessons) that I understood how expensive it was. 1:30 p.m. — I bike to a café at work for lunch. They have vegan chocolate cupcakes (yum!) and I grab two for later, plus vegan pad Thai. I eat a cupcake before biking back. 2 p.m. — Back at my desk and starting my Money Diary. I actually just found out about Money Diaries yesterday and initially thought I would write one in the nebulous future when my life would be more interesting, but then I reconsidered. Why not now? 4 p.m. — Eat the other chocolate cupcake. 5 p.m. — I check my company's stock price and it has dropped quite a bit. The trading window for employees is currently open and I have a lot of vested shares I want to sell, but I'll wait until the price (hopefully) goes up again. During my first few years at this job, I didn't look at my shares at all. I didn't really know what it all meant and was too lazy and intimidated to figure it out. It wasn't until last year that I realized I should be selling my shares! 5:15 p.m. — I sponsor a hen residing at Hen Harbor, an animal sanctuary I've visited before. She was rescued from an urban flock of backyard hens, where she assumed the role of the rooster and started crowing. A gender non-conforming chicken! I make my monthly $10 payment. 8 p.m. — Finish my Duolingo session for the day. (I'm trying to learn Spanish and Vietnamese.) Tôi hạnh phúc! 8:30 p.m. — A friend and I share our weekly roundup of articles we found interesting and include a line about writing a Money Diary this week: ""If we hate capitalism and debt, and living in a world where we need money to survive, we have to learn to talk about it in order to change it."" I insert a GIF of Rob Bliss protesting the FCC's vote to end net neutrality by biking extremely slowly in the middle of the street. It makes me laugh and cry at the same time. 10:30 p.m. — I go to bed in my car. Daily Total: $0",1,250
"7:30 a.m. — Morning wake-up call! My partner and I talk a little about a podcast episode we both listened to, . 8:15 a.m. — I take a shower at the gym and try to stretch my ear holes to the next gauge, but it feels like a bigger size difference than previous times. I give my ears a rest and try again in a week. 9 a.m. — I get an email from PreetiRang Sanctuary saying that they're booked for February and another email from Critical Resistance with the new issue of . I donate $15, plus a bit extra since it's through Network for Good, as part of my monthly donations. 9:30 a.m. — Get oatmeal before the café closes! 10:30 a.m. — A friend I know through volunteering emailed about a free workshop for women and non-binary coders. I register! 11:45 p.m. — I bike to a café on campus where you can make your own sandwich. (Food on campus is free.) I make two and grab vegan chocolate chip cookies before biking back to my desk. 12:30 p.m. — Time for my aerial silks class. Most exercise classes at work are also free, and this is one of them! I haven't exercised in a few weeks because I got sick and then got my period (ugh), so I feel a little weak. I got good stretches in during that time, though. 2 p.m. — I eat one of the sandwiches and some cookies. 4:30 p.m. — I get on an early shuttle bus to San Francisco for a queer Lunar New Year event planning meeting. I planned to do work on the bus, but like I often do, I fall asleep after half an hour or so. (This shuttle is free for full-time employees.) 5:45 p.m. — Traffic isn't bad today! I get a surprise call from my partner and we talk en route to our respective meetings. 6 p.m. — Event planning meeting! Dinner is provided and we eat food from the venue where we're considering hosting the event. 8 p.m. — I bike to the Caltrain station ($7.70) and head back home, where I do my Duolingo lesson for the day (¡mañana es el sábado!) and start watching on Netflix. I like Netflix's series because they have audio descriptions — additional narration that describes what's going on visually, which is super important for people who are blind or have low vision. (And I don't need to look at the screen!) $7.70 10 p.m. — I get back to the office, eat late-night cereal, and start watching . I'm so bad at sleeping at a reasonable time on the weekends. Daily Total: $7.70",2,250
"11:30 a.m. — Lazy morning today; I stayed up so late last night watching Netflix. I get ready for the day in the office bathroom and eat my sandwich from yesterday. 1:30 p.m. — Bike to the dentist to get a crown on my back molar. I had an emergency root canal last year and finally scheduled a follow-up appointment. My dental insurance covers half the cost and I put it on my credit card (1.5% cash back). I'll submit a reimbursement form from my HSA later. $550.20 3:30 p.m. — When I get back to the office, my dad calls me because I asked for the account login to our family phone account. I need to change the current auto-pay credit card because I want to cancel the card I'm currently paying with. It's the first credit card I ever got and the phone bill is all I use it for now, but it's been on auto-pay for forever and I haven't been able to log in! I realize I still have $4.62 in reward points on the card, so I use it to buy a book I've been wanting to read, by Leona Chen, using points through Amazon. I'll pay off the balance and cancel the card later. $12.82 5:15 p.m. — I bike to the Caltrain station to head into the city ($7.70). I'm meeting up with another partner of mine to watch a play called . We're both asexual, so we're excited and hopeful that the play will be good! $7.70 6:30 p.m. — I bike to Rainbow Grocery to get snacks and food for my partner because I have spare time. I get blueberries, vegan chocolate chip cookies, granola, chocolate covered coconut chews, and sticky rice wrapped in lotus leaves. $18.02 7:30 p.m. — Bike to the theater and get our seats. The tickets are free, but they're accepting donations for the SF Mime Troupe and Asexuality SF, the ace meet-up group in the Bay Area, so I donate $20. My partner arrives, we find seats, and the play starts! 9 p.m. — My partner and I walk to a café and I buy juice so that we have a reason to be there. We talk about the play (we both enjoyed it) and what's been going on in our lives in the last few months. We don't meet in person very often, but it's a pleasure when we do. $4 11 p.m. — I bike to the home of a couple of friends nearby to drop off phone privacy screens for them. It's late and cold and they're about to go to sleep; they invite me to stay over and if I had planned better, it would've been easier to do that since I have a few events in East Bay tomorrow. But I left my things at home and already planned to go back. We say goodnight and I bike to the Caltrain. 11:30 p.m. — I get to the train station and hurriedly finish my Duolingo for the day. My streak continues! I fall asleep after a while, but not before setting an alarm so I don't miss my stop. $7.70 1:30 a.m. — I get back to the office, toss my bag into my chair, and immediately go to bed. I should've brushed my teeth (that's probably why I needed a root canal in the first place) but I'm so tired! Daily Total: $600.44",3,250
"12:45 p.m. — I jolt out of bed because I've majorly overslept! It was a bit colder last night and I was enjoying the warmth of my bed this morning. I shower at the gym and toss Clif Bars in my bag for later. 1:15 p.m. — Bike to the Caltrain station to head up to East Bay. I was going to go to a music rehearsal, but it was just canceled. (This flu season is really kicking people's butts.) This means I have to lug around my instrument, but I also have a few extra hours to get food for a study group later and finish up the study group reading! I eat a Clif Bar. $5.45 2:30 p.m. — I transfer to BART and finish my Duolingo for the day. (Tiếng Việt rất khó.) $5.10 3:30 p.m. — I bike to Vegan Donut Gelato to get potluck goodies. I buy a dozen donut holes and donuts to share (sugar-dusted, rainbow sprinkles, and chocolate) and sit outside to finish the readings. We're studying the history of China, starting from the social movements in the early 1900s until the present, and how it impacts those of us in the diaspora today. $13.12 5 p.m. — Study group time! It's really great to hear everyone's different perspectives and stories, along with what they thought about the text we read. Everyone brought yummy food, too. We're meeting at LOL (Liberating Ourselves Locally), a POC-led makerspace, and we all chip in for rental costs. $5 7:15 p.m. — I bike to BART and only have to wait a few minutes for the train! $5.10 8:30 p.m. — Dash up and down the stairs with my bike in time to make Caltrain. I call my partner to catch up on both of our weekends since they're visiting their family out of town. $5.45 9:45 p.m. — Stop by Safeway on my way home to get glutinous rice flour for the Lunar New Year potluck in two days, but they don't have any. I have an interesting conversation with a stranger in the baking aisle, though. 10:30 p.m. — I get back to the office and start laundry. I've run out of pants! My workplace has washers and dryers and provides laundry detergent as well. It's late, but I make tea, eat a donut, and catch up on emails. 1 a.m. — I finish my laundry, fold my clothes, and go to bed. Daily Total: $39.22",4,250
"8:30 a.m. — Morning wake-up call, even though my partner is on vacation! They're so sweet, despite me being so, so sleepy. 9:30 a.m. — I get coffee, go through articles in my RSS feed, and do work. 10:30 a.m. — Eat the last donut from yesterday. I love donuts. 12 p.m. — I go through my non-work emails. I helped design anti-deportation flyers last year for some friends and they emailed me for the base images so other organizations in their network could put their own text on top. I export the images and send them along. I'm currently helping out with flyers for community-based solutions to police, so I send an email asking for a few design clarifications. I also start a document to write down the craft ideas my partner and I have for TGNC Rights and Empowerment Day. An organization we both volunteer for asked for help setting up an arts and crafts table. 1 p.m. — I bike to a work café for lunch and get risotto and tapioca pudding (and some extra for later!). 4 p.m. — I go to ballet class at work, which is also free. I move like a graceless animal, but it's fun. 5:30 p.m. — Drive to a meeting about labor activism in tech. It's rush hour and traffic is awful, but we're meeting in Cupertino, which is a bit too far to bike to and not close enough to public transportation and shuttle stops. It's fun to meet everyone and discuss possible action items to work on over the next few months. 8:30 p.m. — I stop by 99 Ranch to get glutinous rice flour on my way home. It's on sale! I get a bit of ginger for the sweet soup and tofu snacks to munch on, too. $2.99 9 p.m. — I get back to the office and eat my lunch leftovers for a late dinner. I finish my Duolingo for the day and surf the Internet. 1 a.m. — Bedtime. Daily Total: $2.99",5,250
"8:45 a.m. — Morning wake-up call! We're both tired, so it's a short talk. I listen to my morning podcasts in bed because it's cozy and I'm lazy this morning. 9:30 a.m. — I get coffee and convince myself to do work. 12:30 p.m. — Bike to a work café to get lunch: vegetables, noodles, lots of garlic bread (yum), and sorbet for dessert. 1:30 p.m. — I go to donate blood. I'm lazy, so I only donate when there's a drive at work, which is only a few times a year. But I cough while I'm in the bloodmobile and the donor technician is suspicious that I'm still sick from my cold a couple weeks ago and turns me away. I don't want to make anyone sick but it's a little frustrating. It was the first and only time I've coughed this week! 4 p.m. — I get on an early bus to Berkeley for the Lunar New Year potluck, do work for a while, and then finish my Duolingo lesson for the day. 6 p.m. — My dad calls me as I'm getting off the bus. My mom has been applying for different jobs for the past few months, and she got an offer today! My dad tells me to call her, so we say bye and I call my mom while I bike to my friend's place. She's excited and has another interview in a couple of days. 6:30 p.m. — I get to my friend's place and say bye to my mom. We start cooking! Another person also brought tang yuan to make, so we have an abundance of dessert — but we don't have any vegetables to eat except for the scallions in the scallion pancakes! We make a lot of starchy and fried foods. Probably should've coordinated who was bringing what, nutrition-wise. Everything's delicious, though! We practice our Mandarin (we're all heritage language learners) and try to remember New Year's stories from our childhoods. 新年快樂! 9 p.m. — I bike to my partner's place now that they're back in town. Yay, cuddles! Daily Total: $0",6,250
"7 a.m. — Time to wake up. I just want to cuddle! 7:30 a.m. — I say bye to my partner, bike to the shuttle stop, and get on the bus to go to work. I listen to my usual morning podcasts and fall asleep before the first one even finishes! 9:30 a.m. — I get to the office and get coffee along with two halves of vegan donuts, a special office treat for Valentine's Day. 12 p.m. — I set a limit order to sell half of my current vested company shares. The price has been rebounding, so I'm hoping it'll go through before the end of the trading window. 12:30 p.m. — I bike to two cafés: one to get japchae for later (my favorite dish), and another one further away for noodle soup. It works out well because I need to stop by someone's desk on the other side of campus anyway. 3 p.m. — I go to aerial silks class. I'm feeling stronger! I take a shower at the gym afterward. 4:30 p.m. — My limit order went through. The stock price has been increasing faster than I thought it would –now I wish I set the limit for higher! My shares sold for $21,400, and I put in another limit order for half of the rest at an even higher price. 7 p.m. — I finish my Duolingo for the day and start putting stickers on my bike. I bought a bunch of cute stickers recently but then got too lazy to put them all on. There are a lot and I only put about a fifth on before I get tired. An old bike of. mine was stolen a year ago and it was devastating. I'm hoping all the stickers will deter any bike thieves. 10 p.m. — I start watching on Netflix but I'm so tired! I go to bed and finish the episode under my covers. Daily Total: $0",7,250
"5:45 a.m. — I wake up after only hitting snooze once, make coffee, let the dog out, do a quick meditation on my Calm app, and then get ready. As soon as I go downstairs to make my lunch, my toddler wakes up, so I get her while my husband showers and gets ready. I finish making my lunch and packing my stuff for the day. 6:35 a.m. — I walk to the commuter rail, hop on the train, and transfer to the shuttle at the station to my office, which is free for employees. I get my coffee at work and also have a leftover cupcake for breakfast (so healthy, I know!). 12:30 p.m. — I go for a quick lunchtime run and then eat lunch at my desk – PB&J, carrots, and a Diet Coke from home. I also buy a cookie from the work café. $1.61 4 p.m. — I meet my husband to carpool home. He drives and we listen to NPR and discuss politics. We pick up our daughter at daycare and stop by Whole Foods to grab salmon for tonight. I think about buying other items but resist. $8.89 5:30 p.m. — After we get home, I cut a sweet potato into cubes and toss it into the oven. I change my clothes while my husband cooks the salmon, and then I entertain our toddler with a series of stretches for a fitness challenge I'm doing; she climbs all over me. We eat dinner and my daughter insists on switching plates with me. She also thinks sweet potato cubes are cookies (apparently anything we put in the oven to bake = cookies right now) and gladly eats a lot of them. After dinner, we play and I do the dishes and straighten up. Then it's bath time and pajamas. It's my night to read so we read six books before I put her in her crib, say goodnight, and she's out. I am incredibly thankful she goes to sleep so easily. 8 p.m. — I watch on Hulu in the basement with a bowl of ice cream. (My husband doesn't watch the show, so he's upstairs.) Around 8:30, I go upstairs, do a quick meditation through Calm, and shower before reading in bed. I fall asleep around 10. Daily Total: $10.50",1,251
"7 a.m. — We get to sleep in today because we have a preschool tour at 9 a.m. today; my daughter gets a chance to play in a classroom to see if she likes it. Luckily, she loves it and so we do, too, so we pay the $725 registration fee. This new school will be five days a week and our monthly care cost will increase to $2,095. My mom picks our daughter up from the tour and takes her home because it's her day for childcare. My husband and I go to work. $725 10:30 a.m. — I have a morning of meetings and grab coffee and a KIND bar from my desk. We're having a catered lunch at 1 p.m., but I get hungry around 12 and grab chips and a cookie from the café. $2.16 4 p.m. — Leave work with husband and head home. It snowed and sleeted during the day so my husband starts shoveling. We have playtime and I check the mail; there's a $160 refund check from our pet insurance, and I mobile deposit it. 6:45 p.m. — For dinner, my husband makes tomato, cucumber, and feta salads for us, and chicken nuggets, tomato, cucumber, and blueberries for my daughter. We sit down around 6 and my daughter basically has a tantrum all of dinner. First, she wants my food, then she wants to eat sitting on my lap, then she doesn't want to eat. After dinner, I hang out with our daughter while my husband cleans up. (She won't let me go in the kitchen to clean and it isn't worth the battle.) We start bedtime but I have to leave to go to a Mason jar salad party with fellow challengers from the exercise group I'm in! I grab bring along snacks: an opened bag of pita chips and tzatziki from Costco. I feel slightly bad about the open bag of chips, but it's casual and no one cares. I hang out for about two hours and make three Mason jar salads. 9:30 p.m. — I'm home and ready for bed. I finish up a book and go to sleep at 10. Daily Total: $727.16",2,251
"5:45 a.m. — My alarm goes off. I snooze it once and then roll out of bed to get ready and let the dog out. Make coffee for myself, pack my lunch (Mason jar salad), and start my car because it's chilly out; I also throw salt on our steps to de-ice them. I didn't get to see my daughter this morning because she actually slept in a bit. (She usually wakes up when she hears me going up and down the stairs.) The commute takes about 45 minutes, and I drink my coffee while driving. 8:30 a.m. — The worksite I'm at today provides snacks for employees, so I grab a Naked Green Machine smoothie and peanut butter crackers with coffee. 11:45 a.m. — I was going to run at lunch but decided not to, due to a combination of icy sidewalks, sore feet, and general laziness. I eat my chicken and berry Mason jar salad and follow it up with M&M's. I drink have two Diet Cokes (one from home and one free from work). I have a Diet Coke addiction ... and a sweets addiction. 1:30 p.m. — Call the YMCA to register my toddler for a tumbling class. She swims with my husband on Saturday mornings so this is something for the two of us to do together on Sundays. $115 4:30 p.m. — On our way home, my husband stops to get contact solution for me ($13.06). I do a quick workout for my boot camp challenge while my toddler plays on me. Dinner time for the toddler, but she barely touches it because she's been snacking all day. After dinner, it's quick cleanup, playtime, and then a workout class at the gym. $13.06 7:45 p.m. — I get home from my workout class, and my husband has made pizza for dinner. As soon as I walk in the door, my daughter wakes up and starts crying, so I go up and rock her for a little bit. Then it's dinner, Olympic viewing, reading, and bedtime! Daily Total: $128.06",3,251
"5:30 a.m. — TGIF! I want to get to work early to crank out some risk assessments. I get up and get ready, and remember to take the train pass out of my car so my husband can use it and have a Diet Coke and a Luna bar during the drive. 8:15 a.m. — I order a watch band for my husband. I got him one for Christmas but it was too big, so I returned it and got a refund. The new band is $0.95 more, so I pay the difference. $0.95 11:30 a.m. — Grab snacks. I was going to run, but the locker room is closed for maintenance. $3.87 4:30 p.m. — I meet up with my husband for the drive home. He took the train in this morning (which is paid for by his work), so I drop him off at the station to get his car and then he goes to the gym. I go home and squeeze in a quick, three-mile run before daycare pickup. I get my daughter and then we swing by the library to grab museum passes. My husband runs into the store on his way home and picks up ice cream sundae makings. $24.29 6:30 p.m. — My husband and I order dinner after feeding our daughter. He picks it up while I do bedtime. I get a steak tip pita roll and he gets some type of sub. $17.87 9:30 p.m. — Post-dinner conversation includes our credit card debt and vacation. We want to start using our JetBlue account for monthly expenses so that we get the points, but we need to pay off the balance first. So we pay an additional $900 towards it for the month. Watch the Olympics and then go to bed. $900 Daily Total: $946.98",4,251
"6:15 a.m. — Our toddler is in bed with us so we stay there for as long as possible. We get up around 6:45 and make breakfast for the kiddo and coffee for us. We're getting new cable installed this morning and they just called to say they can come early, so my husband and daughter head off to swim lessons and then the grocery store while I do a quick workout and wait for the cable guy. 9:30 a.m. — Husband and daughter get home with the groceries: spinach, cucumbers, tomatoes, yogurt (lots, because my daughter loves it), peanut butter, apples, bananas, ice cream, frozen pizza, bread, pita, and organic whole milk ($95.59). My husband usually buys a donut for me from the Dunkin' Donuts at the grocery store, but he left it on a shelf along with his coffee! My daughter got her two Munchkins while shopping, though ($2.99). $98.58 12 p.m. — We play at the park, have lunch, and then put the toddler down for her nap before I go out for my run. When I get back an hour later, the cable guy has finished but we need to fix our dryer vent; it came off while he was installing something. It takes a few attempts but we're successful! 3:30 p.m. — Toddler is up from her nap and has a snack. Now we're off to Target. She needs valentines for her daycare class (yes, toddlers exchange valentines apparently). We go to Nordstrom Rack on the way because my husband and I both need new work shoes. We each get a pair. $79.86 3:30 p.m. — At Target we buy grape jelly, Hershey's Kisses, valentines, Luna bars, and something else I'm forgetting. $20.48 4:30 p.m. — We also get gas for my car while we're out. $30.61 10 p.m. — My husband goes out with friends while my daughter and I hang out and do dinner and bedtime. After she's down, I watch the Olympics and chill until my husband gets home around 10. Daily Total: $229.53",5,251
"6:30 a.m. — We bring the toddler in bed with us again so that we can hopefully get more shuteye. We're successful for a bit and then start our day. 8:30 a.m. — It's rainy and dreary. I am already sick of being inside so we go to IHOP for breakfast and get eggs, bacon, sausage, French toast, pancakes, and home fries; my daughter gets a fun pancake with a smiley face on it. $41.12 3 p.m. — Most of the day is spent doing laundry, relaxing, and making lunches for the week. After my daughter's nap time, we leave for a free trial of a local indoor play space. Our toddler burns some energy at the playgroup, and we get to socialize. 8 p.m. — We eat breaded chicken and green beans for dinner. I hate Sunday evenings because Monday is right around the corner. I stay up too late watching the Olympics (OMG, Mirai Nagasu, I love you!) and then can't fall asleep. I think I finally doze off around 11. Daily Total: $41.12",6,251
"5 a.m. — My alarm goes off but I sleep for another 30 minutes. After that alarm, the toddler starts stirring. (I think it's time to push bedtime back so she'll sleep later.) I get up and give her the lovey that fell out of her crib, and then I get ready. By the time I'm done at 6 a.m., she's up again, so I get her while my husband gets ready. I'm out the door around 6:20 and at work by 7 a.m. The house cleaners come today (but, spoiler, when I get home, I'm not thrilled with the job they do). $100 11 a.m. — I bite the bullet on an Amazon order sitting in my cart with vitamins for me (Krill Oil Omega-3, vitamin D, and Floradix), dog food, and pouches for the toddler. $172.17 12 p.m. — I eat a salad from home (it has spinach, tomato, cucumber, bell peppers, berries, feta, and balsamic vinegar) and then go for a walk. Come back and grab a churro from a catered lunch at the office. 4:30 p.m. — I pick up my daughter from daycare and head home. We have pasta and meatballs for dinner, and my husband does bedtime while I go to a workout class. 9 p.m. — I come home and we watch the Olympics before going to bed. Daily Total: $272.17",7,251
"8 a.m. — After waking up and feeding the cat, I brew coffee and head to work. (I've been brewing at home more often lately in an attempt to avoid purchasing the overpriced coffee at the café in my building.) It's chilly out but nice enough to walk; the university I work at gives me a free yearly bus and Metro pass, but since it's less than a mile away, I usually travel on foot. 12:30 p.m. — Most days, I eat in the lunch room with my coworkers, but today, we have a presentation on women's reproductive health. A vulvovaginal dermatologist presents some of the diseases she specializes in treating; the subject matter might gross people out (especially while eating lunch) but I've been working with this lab for years and it doesn't faze me. 3 p.m. — Feeling the late-afternoon slump hard, I take a short break and grab a granola bar from the vending machine, as well as a cup of free hot chocolate from the department's stock. Most of my actual lab work is done for the day, so I take the treats back to my desk and catch up on documentation for the few projects I'm working on. $1.25 7 p.m. — After a long day in the lab, I walk home. For dinner, I haphazardly throw together a meal of frozen veggies and boxed mac and cheese before I visit my parents. They live about 20 minutes away from me, so I try to make an effort to visit them at least once a week, if not more. I'm in the process of applying to graduate programs and I know that if I get in, I'll move across the country and won't be able to see them as often, so I'm trying to make the most of living in the same town as them for now. (Plus, they let me do laundry at their house for free!) Daily Total: $1.25",1,252
"8:30 a.m. — It's Friday! I wake up a bit earlier today and head out for a jog. (I've been slacking on running lately because it's been below freezing most days.) Then I make a quick breakfast of scrambled eggs and toast along with some coffee. Our lab doesn't have a dress code because we're wearing lab coats most of the day (besides long pants and closed-toe shoes for safety reasons), but on Fridays, I tend to wear leggings and a hoodie, which is far more casual than what I wear the rest of the week. It saves me time in the morning and is a lot more comfortable. I pack my bag, walk to work, and begin the day. 12 p.m. — Our department has regular lunch seminars where labs can present what they've been working on lately. They always provide free pizza (which is pretty much my main motivation to go to these things). I get two slices of cheese and a cup of coffee. The seminar today is about tuberculosis and it's pretty interesting. 4 p.m. — After a long day working on isolating DNA from samples and culturing plates of bacteria for future experiments, I finally get a chance to sit down and catch up on documentation. I try to write in my lab notebook every day, and if I do something different than normal, I note that. I grab a hot tea and get to work. 6 p.m. — After work, I head home and pack. I'm driving to see my boyfriend for the weekend. He lives an hour and a half away in the town we both went to college in, so we try to see each other every weekend or at least every other weekend. I fill my tank for less than $20 (love those Midwest gas prices!), grab a snack from the gas station, and hit the road. I recently got my first credit card, and I've been using it to pay for gas because I earn 5% back on gas station purchases during this quarter. I'm still new to the whole credit card thing, so I try to be cautious with how much I use it. So far it's been working out. I have a pretty decent credit score already because I make my student loan payments on time, but I know I need to build it up more. $23 9 p.m. — My partner isn't much of a cook, but he attempts to make grilled cheese sandwiches and tomato soup for dinner. It's not too bad, and we're all about saving money by cooking at home as often as possible. We spend the evening catching up and watching Amazon's new show, . We're both pretty big sci-fi nerds, so a series based on the stories of Philip K. Dick is right up our alley! Daily Total: $23",2,252
"10:30 a.m. — Thankful to be able to sleep in this morning. After I wake up, I go for a quick jog, shower, and do my skincare routine. My partner has to work from 12 to 5 today, so I've called up a few of my old college friends to see if anyone wants to hang out. One friend is free and we decide to walk to a coffee shop. I get a dirty iced chai tea latte, my favorite! It's pricey, but I know the owners of the shop and I'm happy to support a local business. $5.30 2 p.m. — My friend has Kohl's Cash that he wants to spend, so we go to the local shopping center. It's a small town so having Kohl's is a big deal. We spend a bit of time browsing, and I find a blue button-up top that over my bust (!) and is on sale! I find a cute pair of shoes on sale, too. I have a shoe problem, I'll admit, but these sneakers have a pretty embroidered floral design and they'll be great for spring. $45 5 p.m. — When my boyfriend gets off work, my friend and I pick him up and we all go out to dinner. Shakes and burgers for them and chili for me. We each pay for our own meals and spend a few hours chatting before we drop off my friend. I text my brother, who is watching my cat while I'm away. She's pretty independent and does fine on her own for a day or two, but he lets me know he's been over to feed her. $10.88 8:30 p.m. — My friend and I decide to meet for beers at our local craft brewery. I've been trying to do Dry January and it has been going well so far, but I really miss the local beer, so I get one and pay for one of hers, too. I have cash, which I use instead of my card. She buys us a charcuterie platter and we talk the night away. $12 11 p.m. — After my friend goes home, my boyfriend and I head to a local dive bar to catch up with other old friends and play pool. I'm not drinking the rest of the night, so he buys me a Sprite and I agree to be the designated driver. We close out the bar and head home around 1 a.m. Daily Total: $73.18",3,252
"11 a.m. — Ugh. I didn't drink a lot last night, but I've overslept enough that I get that icky, groggy feeling of too much sleep and not enough water. I do some yoga to try and shake it before making coffee. Boyfriend's mom is coming over for lunch today, so we go to the grocery store for ingredients. He pays. 1 p.m. — We whip up spaghetti with homemade tomato sauce, brussels sprouts, garlic bread, and red wine. His mom and younger brother come over with their dog, and we have a nice time catching up. After lunch, we walk to the park and play catch with the dog. It's brisk out but not as cold as it's been lately, which is nice. 7 p.m. — Boyfriend packs me leftovers to take home. It'll make a nice lunch tomorrow. I say my goodbyes, fill up my tank and hit the road. $22 10 p.m. — I like to take long, hot baths on Sunday evenings and then cozy up with a book and a cup of tea. Before going to bed, I program the coffee maker to brew in the morning. Daily Total: $22",4,252
"8 a.m. — I wake up, after snoozing my alarm twice, to my cat pawing at my face. My apartment is freezing. The temperature dropped at least 20 degrees overnight and it's near torture to drag myself out from under my heated blanket. I feed the cat breakfast and pour myself coffee. I consider going for a jog this morning, but I really hate running in freezing temps because I don't have the proper gear. I do some light stretching instead. Today is cold, but I don't feel like waiting for the bus, so I just walk. 12 p.m. — One of my coworkers presents a paper she's working on and hoping to submit soon. We give feedback on her work, and after the meeting is over, it's back to the lab. I eat the leftover spaghetti I brought and an apple. 6 p.m. — After I get home from work, I take a look in my fridge and realize it's time to go grocery shopping. I grab my reusable bags and head to the Trader Joe's about 20 minutes away. I usually go to Schnucks (a local supermarket chain) but I specifically want a few Trader Joe's items. I pick up plenty of fresh veggies, a loaf of bread, cheese, beans, rice, almond butter, hummus, coffee, oranges, chickpeas, granola bars, a bottle of merlot, a few tins of cat food, and other odds and ends. This will last me about two weeks. I have a system: eat all the produce and perishables first, then subsist on beans and rice for the last week until I get paid and can go shopping again. $90.15 8 p.m. — When I get home, I listen to Sango while I cook dal with rice for my dinner. I've come to really love cooking in the past year. There's something romantic and beautiful about filling my tiny kitchen with the aroma of garlic, ginger, and onions, and then creating a dish out of individual ingredients. A coworker gifted me a box of garam masala seasoning, which brings the dal to a whole new level. I put aside enough for my lunch tomorrow before digging in. 11 p.m. — I try out a new face mask that makes my skin so bright and clear! Then I play with my cat for a little bit before crawling into bed. She plays by herself for a while, but around midnight she usually crawls on top of my feet and sleeps there for the rest of the night. Cats are so weird. Daily Total: $90.15",5,252
"7:30 a.m. — It's so cold in my apartment, once again. Luckily a hot cup of coffee is a good incentive to get out of bed. I drink a cup, then shower, drink another, have a piece of toast, pack up my stuff, and head out. My impatience gets the best of me, and I walk in the cold rather than wait for the bus. 12:30 p.m. — A few of my coworkers also brought lunch from home today, so we all hang out and eat. We end up sitting and chatting for a while before going back to the lab. I've been working on getting samples ready for sequencing for about a week now, so I'm really excited to finally get it done. 6 p.m. — With the samples submitted, I finish up some documentation and walk home. I spend my evening Skyping with a long-distance friend while snacking on red peppers and hummus. After we say our goodbyes, I relax in a hot bubble bath and make it through a chunk of the book I checked out from the library. 11 p.m. — Bedtime! I set my alarm, prep the coffee machine, and browse Reddit for a little while before falling asleep. Daily Total: $0",6,252
"8 a.m. — I follow my usual morning routine. The weather is a little nicer today, so I go for a quick run. Then, it's shower and skincare, pack my lunch, and out the door! 1 p.m. — Over lunch (red peppers, hummus, a granola bar, and an apple, I text with the mom of a potential tutoring client. (I tutor on and off during the semesters. It's a nice way to make a bit of extra cash when I have the time.) I usually tutor high-school students because I'm more familiar with their math level; it's been a while since I worked with any elementary schoolers, but how hard can it be, right? We set up a time to meet. I charge $30 per hour, but the first consultation is free. 3 p.m. — My student loan bill is on auto-pay, and I get a notification that this month's transaction was successful. Yay! Chipping away at that debt piece by piece. Around this same time, I start to get a migraine aura. I suffer from migraines a few times a month. They happen less in the winter, but I think this one was triggered by the big temperature jump today. For me, aura includes scintillating scotoma, which basically looks like an oscillating, shimmering fractal pattern disturbing my normal vision in one eye. Luckily, my job offers really great paid sick time (and my boss is very understanding about migraines), so I am able to go home early and take my medication. Then it's just a matter of laying in my room in the dark and waiting for it to go away. 8 p.m. — Migraines always throw off the rest of my day a little bit. Once this one subsides enough, I force myself to eat toast and drink plenty of water. The medication gives me side effects (brain fog, exhaustion, and a decreased appetite), but they usually wear off in a few hours. I read more of my book, play with my cat, and browse the Internet for a bit before heading to bed. Daily Total: $0",7,252
"10 a.m. — I have the day off, so I roll out of bed slowly. Even though I tend to get very cranky at work, I often feel like I have no purpose on my days off. I decide to spend the day exploring places in NYC that I've neglected since I moved here six months ago. I squeeze in a quick yoga video, scarf down some cereal, get dressed, and am out the door. 12 p.m. — First stop: Glossier! I feel slightly ashamed calling myself a millennial and not owning any Glossier products. I have an anxiety-triggered shopping problem, so I've been trying to rein in my personal care purchases. I feel proud of my single purchase and walk out with a tube of Boy Brow. $16 1 p.m. — I continue to window shop around SoHo and have a mental battle over whether to stop for coffee and treats. I've been trying to cut down on all non-essential spending, so I pull out my emergency snack bag full of nuts, cereal, and miscellaneous items and nibble while I walk around. 4 p.m. — I'm not a fan of football but my sister invited me over for the Super Bowl — and she is a fabulous cook. I buy a bus ticket and make the hour-long trek to Hoboken. $3.50 4:30 p.m. — I make a quick pitstop for wine. My brother joins us as and he kindly brings me a bag of Trader Joe's groceries that my mom paid for! $6 5 p.m. — My sister does not disappoint: I arrive to find a spread of cheeses, berries, homemade wings, taco bowls, chicken parmesan bites, garlic bread, and meatballs. I stuff myself until I can barely breathe. 9:30 p.m. — Sister pays for my $34 Uber home because it's raining cats and dogs outside. She is the most generous person I know. 11 p.m. — I do an abbreviated version of my skincare routine because wine always has a way of making me feel lazy AF. I snuggle in bed with my meditation book and doze off into dreamland. Daily Total: $25.50",1,253
"8 a.m. — Back to the grind! I wake up and do my makeup while listening to one of my favorite podcasts, . It really sets the tone for my day. I head to work and try to spend the majority of my time on the subway meditating; it keeps me from getting ticked off at the MTA system. 10 a.m. — Start my day with quinoa hot cereal from Trader Joe's. I throw in nuts and honey for excitement because it tastes like hot, grainy cardboard by itself. 11 a.m. — The phone in my office is ringing off the hook today, making it difficult to get my work done. I do deep breathing and get back in the game. I am the first point of contact for clients and I like speaking with new people all day, but it can be hard to jump from interacting with clients back to creating reports and spreadsheets. 1 p.m. — I pull out my salad and devour it. I'm very grateful my family buys me groceries from time to time. 5:30 p.m. — The late afternoon crash hits me. I decide to make hot chocolate instead of my typical coffee, and I pair it with SkinnyPop and prepare to leave for the day. My parents ordered a new mattress for my birthday (my first full-sized mattress!) and I can't wait to get home and set up my first adult bed. 6:30 p.m. — Get home and sadness ensues: the mattress has not arrived yet. I throw together snacks for dinner and pack a change of clothes for my workout tomorrow. Generous sister is taking me to my first barre class after work! 8:30 p.m. — Full-on skincare routine is in play tonight. I cleanse and then apply facial mist,  exfoliating serum, and a moisturizing facial oil. 10 p.m. — The mattress finally arrives and I am too excited to not open it immediately. I sweat profusely while setting it up and make a mental note to do more physical activity. Then I open a bag of gummies, intending to have just one, and end up inhaling half the bag. 10:30 p.m. — I FaceTime my long-distance boyfriend and he unloads his work stress onto me. We plan a hotel night for the upcoming weekend and say goodnight. We usually split everything evenly between us, but he just got a raise and a bonus so he pays for the hotel. Daily Total: $0",2,253
"8:30 a.m. — The subway is super crowded today, so I can't sit down and meditate. Bummer. I've been trying to be more flexible when things don't work out perfectly, but it's a struggle for my type-A personality. Instead, I practice deep breathing on my walk from the subway to the office, but it doesn't last long because I get lightheaded. 9:30 a.m. — I avoid a specific walking route that passes by my guilty pleasure coffee spot, La Colombe. I recently read that relying on willpower alone is often ineffective when trying to break habits, so I try to outsmart my brain. Mission fails as I pass by another enticing coffee shop and succumb to the soy latte devil. Tomorrow is another day. $4.50 12:30 p.m. — It's been pretty slow in my office now that it's so cold out and people aren't shopping for new apartments as aggressively, so I peruse job listings my friend sent me while nibbling on Cheerios for breakfast. Sadly, I am vastly under-qualified for all of these jobs. 3 p.m. — Munch on my TJ's salad and wish it was anything other than a salad. Somehow, I end up on Glossier's website. I peek at a few items that interested me in the store a few days ago and search for a gift for my sister's upcoming birthday. Just like that, I have fallen down the online shopping rabbit hole once again. I buy a lip gloss, two bottles of the Solution, and a highlighter. $85 4:30 p.m. — I text my mom about a ballet performance I'm interested in seeing on Thursday. She's intrigued as well, so we each buy our own tickets. $29 6 p.m. — Sister can't find a barre class that I can make it to in time, so we reschedule. I stop at a grocery store for ranch and tomato sauce, frozen veggies, and echinacea tea to (hopefully) help boost my immunity. Flu season is too real. $29 8:30 p.m. — I heat up zucchini noodles with spicy tomato sauce. It's shockingly tasty. 9:30 p.m. — I watch an episode of , do body scan meditation, and dive into my book for a bit before passing out. Daily Total: $147.50",3,253
"9:15 a.m. — I get ready for work today and try leaving my apartment a few minutes later so that I won't have enough time to buy coffee. My plan fails again and I somehow arrive at my stop earlier than I ever have...and I stop for a coffee. Instead of my usual latte, I compromise with a plain coffee. $3 11 a.m. — They've added some new protocols at our office and everyone moans and groans about it. I do the same but secretly am excited to have more things to do! I've been having somewhat of an existential crisis for the past six months or so. This is only my first full-time job since graduating, but I feel like I'm not developing any of my skills here and haven't had any luck finding something else yet. 1:30 p.m. — I don't feel like eating the salad I brought with me today, so I order a Mediterranean platter. I am hoping I can squeeze two meals out of this so I don't feel so guilty ordering out. $16 3 p.m. — I'm heading to a seminar this evening hosted by Yael Shy, the fabulous lady who wrote the meditation book I'm reading, The book has seriously helped me navigate this rocky transition I'm experiencing post-graduation. I'm jumping out of my chair thinking about meeting her tonight! 5:30 p.m. — I attempt to place an order on Forever21.com for shirt options to wear on my birthday, but the page keeps freezing. I take it as a sign that I shouldn't spend money on clothes I'll only wear once. 6:30 p.m. — I Uber to the seminar but arrive quite early, so I pop into CVS intending only to browse but end up buying a lipstick I've had my eye on. $8.50 8:30 p.m. — The seminar is very intimate, which I love. Yael begins with a guided meditation that includes Buddhist-style singing bowls. The rest of the time is spent talking about loneliness and how we can become comfortable with the feeling rather than fighting it. She signs my book and I chat with her for a bit but then I get really flustered and bolt out of the room! 9:30 p.m. — Grab the subway home and nosh on leftover sad French fries from my lunch. I rinse off quickly so I can snuggle in bed and watch another episode of before falling asleep. Daily Total: $27.50",4,253
"8:30 a.m. — I wake up feeling surprisingly anxious, considering I spent the majority of last night meditating and self-reflecting. I grab a coffee on my way to work. Normally, I only buy coffee about once a week because my office has a Keurig, but we ran out of K-Cups and I'm cutting myself a break this week. $1.86 3:30 p.m. — I eat the salad that I neglected yesterday and I really regret it because the cheese has melted together and the lettuce has wilted. I nibble on the tortilla strips it came with and make a cup of hot chocolate to hold me over until dinner. 5:45 p.m. — I leave work a few minutes early to see the ballet I got tickets for with my mom and sister. 8 p.m. — The show has a fantastic live jazz band accompanying the dancing and exceeds all our expectations. Afterward, we Uber to an Indian restaurant for a feast. My sister pays for the Uber and my mom pays for the food. I not-so-subtly try to convince my sister to write a Money Diary because she makes bank and I really want to know more about her financial management. My mom and sister send me home with the leftovers. 9 p.m. — I walk home and literally collapse into my bed after a lovely evening. Daily Total: $1.86",5,253
"1 a.m. — I do my usual morning routine and head to work, stopping for a hazelnut oat milk latte along the way. $5 11:30 a.m. — A friend of mine recently passed away, so I read over some of our old text conversations until I'm on the verge of crying and realize this is inappropriate to do at work. 12:30 p.m. — I reflect on the fact that I really need a change in my life, and decide to send a friend my résumé for the job I feel under-qualified for. Fingers crossed! 2:30 p.m. — I eat leftover chicken tikka masala and naan for lunch. I got my period this morning and am dying for some comfort food, so this is perfect. 6:30 p.m. — Leave the office to catch a bus back to my parents' house for the night. My parents are both retired, so I go home a lot to spend time with them and my older brother, who lives at home as well. Plus, I get to see my puppy and kitty; I miss them like crazy. $8 8:30 p.m. — My mom picks me up from the bus stop and we go home for a night of relaxing and snuggling with my pets. Daily Total: $13",6,253
"11 a.m. — I mosey out of bed and my wonderful mother cooks cheese blintzes for breakfast. 1 p.m. — I shower and get on the road to meet my boyfriend upstate for our hotel night. 2 p.m. — We both arrive, get in a solid snuggle, and head downtown to walk around the adorable shops. I stop at an art supply store and pick up a few small craft items as souvenirs. $3.50 3:30 p.m. — We stop at a boutique coffee shop and I get a soy latte to sip on while my boyfriend eats lunch. We sit next to people who are practicing speaking French. I know a decent amount of French, so I try to follow along with them, but then realize I know a lot less than I thought I did. Sigh. $5 5 p.m. — There's a vegan café here that I am dying to try, so I drag my boyfriend in and order a green juice. $7 7:30 p.m. — Boyfriend and I go to a German gastropub for dinner and order pork belly street tacos, garlic parmesan fries, and chili-rubbed wings. It's so refreshing to go out for a nice meal that doesn't cost an arm and a leg like everything in NYC does. Boyfriend pays and I Venmo him for my portion. $22.50 10 p.m. — Boyfriend and I watch Olympic figure skating for a bit and then I read him some of my meditation book before we both call it a night. Daily Total: $38",7,253
"7:30 a.m. — Wake up for work and prep my lunch and snacks for the day. I chug a glass of warm water with lime juice and Himalayan pink salt. 8:15 a.m. — Didn't have time to eat breakfast, so I stop by my fave local joint and get a black coffee with an everything bagel and cream cheese. Bagels here are a far cry from American ones, but this is one of the best in this city and I'll take what I can get on a Monday morning. This reminds me of a bagel recipe I found on Pinterest that I want to try soon. $7.11 10 a.m. — Have my morning snack at my desk: protein shake and macadamia nuts. (I have to have five meals per day if it's a training day.) 12:30 p.m. — It's a slow time of the month at work, so I go for a short walk around the area on my lunch break and read my book. I'm trying to enjoy the summer as much as I can while it lasts. 1 p.m. — Lunch is baked chicken with frozen veggies (biggest life hack is keeping these in the freezer!) at my desk while drinking water. I do my best to drink about four liters a day because of how much I work out. As soon as I started increasing my water intake, my workouts got better. 4 p.m. — Eat my afternoon snack: yogurt, oats, apple, and protein powder mixed together. 5 p.m. — Drive home and quickly change for my HIIT class at 5:30. The gym is around the corner from my apartment, so it only takes five to 10 minutes to get there and back. 6:30 p.m. — I'm buzzing from my workout. When I get home, I tidy the house, do the dishes, and start cooking dinner (with playing in the background) while I wait for my boyfriend, A.*, to come back from his gym session. 8 p.m. — For dinner, we have baked barramundi fish, brown rice, and green beans. Pre-cooked rice is a lifesaver! 8:30 p.m. — I have a phone interview tomorrow morning for a new job, so I research the company and review my résumé and notes. I close out the day with my usual routine: shower, change into PJs, light a candle by my bed, brush my teeth, wash my face, and apply my serum, moisturizer, face oil, and eye cream. I've been trying to floss more, but often find it hard to remember. (Baby steps.) I'm pretty happy with how strict I've become with my face routine — I used to be horrendous and only washed my face in the shower! Daily Total: $7.11",1,254
"7:15 a.m. — Wake up and do my usual routine. I always sleep poorly when I have a lot on my mind and if I don't get my seven to eight hours per night, I'm a zombie. 8 a.m. — I have my phone interview at home and then rush to work. Luckily, my office is a very short drive away! 8:30 a.m. — Eat breakfast at my desk with a cup of black coffee I make at work.  I got hooked on these one-cup filter coffees when I recently visited family in Japan. My auntie sends me more when I run out (plus other teas and snacks I love, too). 10:30 a.m. — Usual snack of macadamia nuts and a protein shake. 1 p.m. — I eat leftover baked chicken breast with green beans for lunch, but am still feeling super tired around 2:30. I buy an iced black coffee and a large chocolate chip cookie with pistachios. The comatose feeling after is well worth it! $8.30 5:30 p.m. — Head straight to the gym after work and today I'm feeling strong. I love a good strength training session! 6:30 p.m. — Immediately rush to a Yin yoga class to stretch out my muscles and zone out after a hectic day. A good Shavasana is just what I need. It's my anniversary with the yoga studio today, so my drop-in class is free (instead of $15). 8:30 p.m. — Arrive home to dinner cooked by A. – steak, brown rice, and salad. 9:30 p.m. — In bed early to read a few pages of by Eckhart Tolle. It's a slow read, as it takes me a while to comprehend some of his insights, but it's been sitting on my bookshelf for a year and I finally have the chance to give it a go. I put on Calm app music in the background while I'm reading. I've done Calm meditations before, but I recently discovered that the app also has sleepy time music for adults, and I'm hooked.

"7:30 a.m. — Wake up from a great night's sleep. A. and I cuddle, which leads to other fun activities ... and then it's time to get ready for the day so I'm not late. 8:15 a.m. — I drop my boyfriend off at his work since it's on my way. We try to appreciate just how lucky we are with our current commutes because we know it won't last forever. It's great to have so much extra time for life instead of being stuck on public transport or in a car for long periods of time. 9:30 a.m. — I eat my breakfast at my desk but am still hungry after, so I go next door to the coffee shop and get a black coffee with my morning snack. $2.70 1 p.m. — Eat the same leftover lunch while browsing for an anniversary gift for A. I have a 20% off voucher for a luxury hotel we've been wanting to book. It's five-star and the amenities seem unreal, plus the room comes with a bottle of Champagne and late check-out! I make a reservation for $230, which I will pay upon arrival with my debit card. 1:15 p.m. — Get a text from A. that says he's secured us a new health insurance through his company. We get a 7% discount and will only have to pay $79 each per month. Our first charge won't be until next month. 3 p.m. — Payday! I recently changed banks and have a system of dividing my money into four separate accounts allocated for spending and saving. I've calculated that if I follow this new method, I'll have an extra $15,000 saved by the end of the year and will be hopefully close to paying off my loans (two of my 2018 goals). 4 p.m. — My partner and I recently became permanent residents of Australia. We're excited, but this visa status comes with a price tag. Luckily, this is my last payment of $250 until we decide to become citizens! My boyfriend owes me money from the prior week's spending, so I only transfer $100 to him and he covers our payments. $100 6:20 p.m. — Take another HIIT workout class and am exhausted afterward. I don't feel like cleaning or cooking, so I do a little bit of journaling and reading while I wait for A. to get home. 7:30 p.m. — Dinner tonight is leftover steak, green beans, and brown rice while watching the Olympics. We prep basa filets and broccoli for the next three days of lunches. Daily Total: $102.70",3,254
"7:15 a.m. — We hit snooze again, though we had the best intentions of waking early today. We shower, pack lunches, and eat breakfast with the Olympics on in the background. 8 a.m. — Drive my boyfriend to work again and stop at the post office to pick up a package from my friend in California. She's the best! 10 a.m. — Eat the same snacks. (It may sound boring, but I rotate my foods week to week so I'm never bored.) 12:30 p.m. — I call my parents on my lunch break and we chat for a nice 30 minutes. The time difference is 16 hours, so this is usually the best time. I really miss them and California. I ask for their opinions on how to best pay off my student loans, as I have $7,000 left and need to factor in the currency exchange rate. 1 p.m. — I browse jade rollers online while eating my lunch. They're sold out everywhere I check and seem to be quite the craze these days. I think I'll save the purchase until next month anyway. 4 p.m. — Snack is yogurt, protein powder, apples, and oats. So yummy! I also update my personal finance spreadsheet, which tracks my monthly spending and saving against a budget I created. 5:30 p.m. — Weight day at the gym. I'm feeling tired and my grip strength is not good tonight. 7:15 p.m. — Write out my goals for 2018 — better late than never! I have a monthly goals book that I keep separate from my journal. 8:30 p.m. — I put on my silk face mask and earplugs, which I sleep with most nights. Then I try to read but end up falling asleep super early. Daily Total: $0",4,254
"5:30 a.m. — Wake up early and head to the gym for an InBody scan before my morning cardio session. I pay for three scans that I'll use over the next few months. $60 6:30 a.m. — Back home, where I make my warm water concoction and heat up my brekky. 8 a.m. — Walk to work because the weather is stunning (and I'm happy to move my muscles again after this morning's session). I listen to a podcast I just discovered, . All I can say is ""Wow!"" 9:30 a.m. — After a productive hour at work, I desperately need a coffee. I walk next door and order a flat white while resisting any extra treats. $3.50 12:30 p.m. — Read during my lunch break in a pretty park nearby. One of my goals for 2018 is to read a minimum of one book a month (I read two in January!), so this leaves me with one week to finish this book. I'm determined to read at least 20 pages per day. 1 p.m. — Last day of the basa fillet. Every day with lunch I take fish oil, magnesium, multivitamin, vitamin D3, and vitamin B complex. I also always take a probiotic after my last meal of the day (and sometimes even add in calcium and vitamin D, depending on how I'm feeling). 5 p.m. — It's the weekend! I walk leisurely and get home in about 20 minutes. Perfect amount of time to listen to another podcast, by . 6 p.m. — Boyfriend is out having work drinks, so I decide to make myself a Dark and Stormy while trying out a new turkey taco recipe. I bake diced sweet potato and zucchini while stir-frying onion, garlic, turkey, corn, herbs, and spices. Then I combine everything and add rice and cheese. It turns out delicious and I will definitely make it again. 8:30 p.m. — I light a lavender candle and put on a face mask while I start to read. I like to keep the Olympics on mute in the background. I'm a sucker for the Olympics. When A. comes home, I make him a cocktail and we chat on the balcony for awhile. I'm going to miss summer evenings. Daily Total: $63.50",5,254
"7:15 a.m. — Wake up and head to the gym for an amazing sweaty session – best way to kick off the weekend. 9:30 a.m.— A. and I make scrambled eggs, spinach, toast, and eat nectarines for breakfast. 10 a.m. — I only have one flavor of protein powder left (strawberry), so I order more online at a 10% discount. I buy chocolate, vanilla, and mocha, but I get a small size of the mocha one in case I don't like it. $114 11 a.m. — A. and I drive to Port Beach, about 20 kilometers south of the city. The water is crystal blue and so calm. We swim in the ocean and lay out on the soft sand. 1 p.m. — Back home, I reheat last night's leftovers for lunch. I'm exhausted from the beach, so I take a small nap while A. goes into the city to do some shopping. 7 p.m. — We pick up limes, soda water, beers, and mint leaves at the store, and then two of our friends come over before our dinner reservation. We make gin and elderflower cocktails and Dark and Stormies while chatting on the balcony. $10 8:15 p.m. — We call an Uber to take us to dinner. I'll pay for this ride because I know A. will pay for the one home. $9 8:30 p.m. — Dinner and drinks at Nobu were phenomenal. We had champagne to start and then split two bottles of wine with the meal. We had a Teppanyaki set meal, which I cannot recommend it enough! $135 11 p.m. — We go to a sports bar after dinner and have a drink while watching the Ireland vs. Wales rugby game. My friend and I are so full from the meal that we can only manage one gin and tonic each (bought by our boyfriends). The atmosphere at the bar is great, and Ireland wins with an amazing finish! Around 1 a.m., we catch a taxi back home. (A. pays.) Daily Total: $268",6,254
"10 a.m. — Waking up is a struggle this morning! We toss and turn for hours and then finally decide to face the day. I am always famished the morning after I drink. I try to satisfy my cravings by making healthy pancakes topped with banana, peaches, and maple syrup. A. makes his own brekky of eggs, bacon, and toast. While we eat, we watch the Olympics to enjoy the last of the events before the closing ceremony tonight. 12:30 p.m. — Leave the house to pick up a friend who's in town from Adelaide. We drive to a nearby coffee shop and talk leisurely for hours over coffee and lunch. I order a flat white with lamb bruschetta, A. orders a sandwich, and our friend gets a coffee. By the time we leave, it's 2:30. Quality catch-up time! $16 3 p.m. — We drop off our friend at the airport and stop by the store on the way home to do our food shopping for the week. We buy asparagus, zucchini, red pepper, onion, spinach, lettuce, cauliflower, cherry tomatoes, apples, bananas, ground pork, beef, turkey breast, chicken breast, snapper, barramundi, smoked salmon, grass-fed beef steak, Brazil and macadamia nuts, Greek yogurt, feta and cottage cheese, instant brown rice, sparkling water, eggs, and low-carb bread. A. and I split the groceries based on what and how much we eat. $90 7 p.m. — Once we get home from the shop, we lounge around and tidy the house, do laundry, and watch TV. We finally muster the energy to make dinner and A. whips up one phenomenal dish: pad Thai with chicken satay! I'm lucky that he is a such a great cook. After dinner, I know I should meal prep for the week, but my hangover is making me lazy. I decide to wake up early on Monday to prepare lunch instead. After watching Netflix and the closing ceremony, we finally go to bed. I'm going to miss the Olympics, but fingers crossed that I get to go to Tokyo for 2020. Daily Total: $106",7,254
"6 a.m. — Alarm goes off and I'm up. Brush my teeth, throw on sweats, and immediately take the dog for a walk. I walk my dog for 30 minutes every morning, which is a great way to start the day. She's a 40-pound rescue mutt and the vet estimates she's around six or seven years old. 6:30 a.m. — Get home and get ready for work. For my morning skincare routine, I use Cetaphil cleanser followed by Paula's Choice liquid BHA and then sunscreen. I try to make breakfast most days, but today I'm just not hungry today, so I throw leftovers in a bag to eat at work. I also drink a ton of water and take vitamins in the morning. Right now I'm taking vitamin D, vitamin C, N-acetyl cysteine, and BioSil, plus B complex whenever I eat. When I'm ready for work, I give the dog a Kong filled with pumpkin and tell her to kennel up. Then I walk to the co-op and buy a kale Caesar salad and a passionfruit LaCroix for lunch later ($5.24). (I buy all my groceries at a food cooperative.) I stop next door and buy a double bone-dry cappuccino from Starbucks ($4.35) before catching the bus to work. $9.59 9 a.m. — Eat Thai leftovers for breakfast and take my B complex. A coworker gets in about an hour after me and since it's a slow morning, we decide to do a coffee run. He treats me to another cappuccino. (I'm addicted.) 3 p.m. — I leave a little early. I always answer emails in the evening (both faculty and students expect it), so to balance things out, I try not to stay in the office very late. I stop by the co-op for groceries and buy coconut milk, fish sauce, shrimp, curry paste, broccoli, cauliflower, avocado, ginger, garlic, onion, red pepper, oranges, and a grapefruit. $51.33 5 p.m. — Wanted to go for a run, but it's raining super hard and I'm starting to catch a cold from my husband, J.*, so I just get into bed. He does the evening dog care shift and comes home soaking wet. Neither of us feels like cooking, so J. goes out to pick up a pizza — and he brings home candy to entice me out of bed. Daily Total: $60.92",1,255
"5 a.m. — Husband's alarm goes off. I wake up and chat with him a bit. Decide to go to work late because I feel sick. It evens out because I have to stay late at work today anyway. I email my coworkers, say goodbye to my husband, and go back to bed. 8:30 a.m. — I rouse myself and walk the dog. Then I make myself avocado toast with an egg on top and orange slices for breakfast. I also take my vitamins. My vitamin D levels are always really low due to the Seattle climate. Watch an episode of while eating breakfast. 10 a.m. — Realize the sun is shining, so I walk to Starbucks and buy a cappuccino before catching the bus to work. $4.35 12:30 p.m. — I grab a sesame seed bagel with strawberry cream cheese for lunch and start to feel a little better. I also refill my water bottle. $4.26 6 p.m. — Catch the bus and head home. I was supposed to start a new dance class tonight but I just don't have the energy. On my way home, I pick up hot food from the co-op deli for dinner: rice, steamed veggies, sautéed greens, butter chicken, and mac and cheese. I also grab a can of passionfruit LaCroix. J. and I eat dinner together while watching . Then I take a shower and go to bed. $22.35 Daily Total: $30.96",2,255
"5 a.m. — Alarm goes off because I have to be at work early today. I make breakfast to-go, take my vitamins, and get dressed for work while J. takes out the dog and feeds her. When I'm ready, I take her out for a 30-minute walk, scramble to get all my things together and run to catch the bus. 7:30 a.m. — Work, work, work. My job is always changing and the needs vary from person to person, so it's definitely never boring, although sometimes it is stressful. I eventually take a break from working to eat oatmeal with frozen blueberries, honey, chia seeds, and smashed pecans that I brought from home. I also get a drip coffee. (It's cheaper and sometimes just cozier than a cappuccino.) $2.15 11 a.m. — I eat lunch early today (leftovers from last night) because it's just an early kind of day. After I. finish, I decide to take a walk through my building because it's still cold and rainy outside. I'm feeling much better, so perhaps I've successfully warded off a cold! 3:30 p.m. — Head out of the office to my therapy appointment and realize I am starving. I'm early, so I grab a slice of pizza from across the street ($3.58). I've been seeing my therapist once a week for over a year. She's in my health insurance network, so I pay $11.20 for each visit, and she bills me at the end of each month. If she didn't take my health insurance or if my insurance didn't cover mental health, each visit would cost $170, so I feel incredibly fortunate. I wish there were fewer access barriers to good care in this country. My therapist gives me a bill for the past few sessions and I put it in my purse to look at later. $3.58 5 p.m. — Miss the bus home and decide to walk, since it's still kind of light out (yay!) and not raining (double yay!). Walking is my main source of exercise and a great way to meditate. Because I live in Seattle, every walk involves a sizable hill. When I get home, J. has cleaned the kitchen and I decide to finally make the shrimp soup curry I've been wanting to try.  (I bought the ingredients a few days ago.) The recipe method is weird: it's soup, but I'm supposed to steam the broccoli separately and mix the coconut milk with chicken stock in a different bowl. I ignore the instructions and put everything into a soup pot like I normally would. It ends up being delicious! Husband and I eat dinner together and catch up on our days. 9 p.m. — Jump in the shower and go to bed. J. is still recovering from his cold, although he sounds way better than he did a few days ago.

"5 a.m. — Husband's alarm goes off and no one is excited about getting up. I feel the dog burrow deeper into my leg. They groggily get up for their morning routine and I immediately fall back asleep until 6. 6 a.m. — Get up, walk dog. We meet a puppy on our walk and are both stoked. My dog absolutely loves other dogs – puppies in particular. She was chained up in a backyard for the first five years of her life and had multiple litters of puppies without getting the care she needed. When we got her, she had broken teeth (from chewing on a chain), long claws (from never getting nail trims), a fear of men, and horrendous leash behavior. We walk her so much, regardless of weather, because it gives her consistency and gives us all a chance to practice leash-walking. She has come a long way since we got her two years ago. She sits patiently and quietly when she first sees a dog and I can see her using all her little willpower to be good so she can say hello. If you'd told me two years ago that she would learn how to do this, I would have never believed it. 6:30 a.m. — Get home and do my morning routine. While I put lunch together, I remember that I have lunch plans today with a friend I used to work with at my previous job. This means I don't have to lug a giant bag of Tupperware on the bus! 8 a.m. — It's a gorgeous morning (read: light outside and raining slightly, Seattle's version of 80 degrees and sunny), so I walk to Starbucks and get the egg-white bites and a bone-dry cappuccino. My philosophy about money is that if I'm hitting my savings goal and paying my bills and rent responsibly, I can spend the rest of my paycheck on whatever I want. $8.48 11:30 a.m. — Walk to meet up with friends from my old job. It's great to catch up with them and hear updates on the department and their personal lives. We meet for cheap conveyor belt sushi with student prices. Walk back to the office to put in more werk. $16.97 3:30 p.m. — Get home and immediately start brown rice to go with curry soup leftovers for dinner. I clean the apartment a little and look for past billing statements from my therapist. I checked my bill this morning and notice I'd been overcharged, so I rifle through my extremely disorganized filing ""system"" (a.k.a. the drawer where I put bills after I pay them) and find the past statements. I'll bring everything to my next appointment and get it sorted out. 5 p.m. — Husband and I eat dinner and put on . I saw it years ago when it came out but haven't seen it since and I forgot that it's actually really good! (I'm excited for the next one because Rihanna.) I also take a hit from J.'s weed vape pen that we occasionally smoke throughout the week. Because weed is legal here, the stigma around marijuana use is virtually nonexistent. It's nice to live in a place that's ahead of the curve on this subject, but we keep an eye on the federal government. Halfway through the movie, the munchies hit and we start to crave sweets. It's pouring outside so J. orders us cookies to be delivered. Perks of living in the city. Daily Total: $25.45",4,255
"6 a.m. — I didn't hear J.'s alarm, so I wake up at 6 a.m., drink a ton of water, take my vitamins, and take the dog for her walk. I have a huge headache that's verging on a migraine. I hope water and fresh air will help. We go straight back to bed afterward. 8 a.m. — Friday is the best because it's my telework day! Teleworking is extremely common in the tech field, but higher education hasn't quite caught on yet. I'm lucky to have a boss who wants to retain good tech talent and has incorporated this option. I open my laptop and start on emails. Once my inbox is under control, I take a break to do a yoga flow and get ready to meet a friend nearby. 10 a.m. — I take my dog out and get her settled in her bed with a Kong and some balls to keep her occupied. She has never destroyed anything in our house, so I trust her to be out of her kennel occasionally when she's home alone. I head up to the coffee shop, get settled with my friend, and order a cappuccino and avocado toast with an egg and pickled cabbage. It's delicious, and my headache subsides! $15.40 12:30 p.m. — After catching up with my friend and working a little bit, I get up for a break and order another item. I try not to camp out at coffee shops for too long without buying anything because I think it's rude. My general rule is to purchase one menu item per hour. So I get their pear and cranberry shrub. $5.13 1:30 p.m. — I pack up and head back home to do more work. My neighbor texts me to see if I'm around for a dog playdate. Our dogs love playing together, and my neighbor has a nice-sized fenced yard, so the dogs can really party. While the dogs play, my neighbor and I have a glass of wine on her patio and enjoy the sunshine. J. texts and asks me out on a date tonight. We've been married for two and a half years, but I still get butterflies. 5 p.m. — J. comes home and takes care of dog duty. Then we decide to walk to a new place for dinner that we've been wanting to try called How To Cook A Wolf. My headache has subsided, but the rain is back, so we take a bus there. We walk in without a reservation but get a spot at the bar because we're so early. I order spaghetti and a glass of wine, and J. gets the gnocchi. It's all absolutely delicious! He picks up the tab. 7 p.m. — We stop by Trader Joe's and get snacks for our drive tomorrow. J. pays for those too. The rain has lessened a little bit, so we walk home. Living in the Pacific Northwest in the winter is like living in a rain cloud. 9 p.m. — We get home and take the dog out. Then we have romantic quality time, which is the best! I stay in bed and read while J. goes out to the living room and watches TV. Daily Total: $20.53",5,255
"6 a.m. — Dog alarm! She doesn't care about sleeping in on Saturdays; she's just hungry, so I feed her breakfast and we go for a long walk. 7 a.m. — Get home, make peanut butter toast and coffee for breakfast, start laundry, and pack. We booked an Airbnb for the night in a town outside the city where most of our friends live. Our plan is to move there one day, but there aren't as many career opportunities in that area, so for now, we're saving for a down payment and keeping an eye on job postings. 9:30 a.m. — We take the dog to her annual vet appointment. Our dog is strange in that she absolutely loves the vet and gets very excited in the car once she recognizes the vet office's street. She gets a Bordetella vaccine, a complimentary nail trim, a six-month supply of Trifexis, and most importantly, a clean bill of health. A couple of years ago, census data showed that more dogs than children live in Seattle, so we don't skimp on the vaccines or parasite protection. The cost for the visit comes out of our savings, earmarked for dog costs. $234.72 10:30 a.m. — We get home and J. gets himself ready for the weekend while I walk to the UPS store. I have a care package to send my sister, who's in college. The total for packing supplies and shipping comes to $15.24. Then I pop into the used bookstore down the block. Their inventory is excellent and they have a hilarious shop cat who yells at every customer. She won't stop until you greet her so I chat with her a little while I browse. I pick up by Elena Ferrante and by Anita Diamant ($18.72). $33.96 11 a.m. — There's an Aesop store on my way home, and I've been thinking about getting their Marrakech Intense rollerball for the past two months. (I stop in once a week to use the tester.) At $95, it's an expensive splurge for me, but today I walk in and decide to just buy the dang thing because I really do love it. $104.60 11:15 a.m. — Starbucks is right next door, so I figure since I've already spent hundreds of dollars today, I may as well get a cappuccino. $3.58 1:30 p.m. — We pack up the car and get on the road! My car is 15 years old and I take very good care of it. We could probably get by without a car where we live, but it's nice to have for large grocery trips, hauling the dog around, and getting out of the city. I drive while J. coordinates plans with our friends, and by the time we've reached the Airbnb, he has evening movie plans figured out and tickets bought with gift cards we had. 3 p.m. — Check into the Airbnb and I immediately lock myself in the bathroom to take the longest, hottest bath of my life while J. takes the dog on a long walk. There's a lot to love about our Seattle apartment, but the bathroom situation is not on that list. We have a small hot water heater, which means really short showers. It's good for the environment, but showering at home is not a relaxing part of my day. I luxuriate in the bath and use a toner sample from Aesop. When I finally leave the bathroom, J. puts on the DVD we found (it's a family-friendly Airbnb) to entertain me while I sit on the couch and do my makeup. 5:30 p.m. — Dog is exhausted from her long day and passes out in her kennel. We always travel with it so doesn't roam around new spaces unattended. We meet friends to watch and holy hell, it is amazing. Highly recommend. It's super cathartic to watch Frances McDormand embody this angry character who says and does whatever the hell she wants. It's not a perfect movie, but dang is it truly a movie for our times. 8 p.m. — We go to a new restaurant in town with some friends where another friend manages the bar. I get three tacos and a beer; the food is insane, the company is the best, and I never want to leave. J. and I go dutch. $16.70 10 p.m. — Say our goodbyes and head back to the Airbnb after a busy and fun day. J. and I hang out, get intimate, goof around, and just enjoy each other's company. Daily Total: $393.56",6,255
"8 a.m. — Everyone sleeps in, and it's heaven. J. gets up first because he's meeting up with some dudes for breakfast. He's really good at maintaining friendships with great people, which I love about him. Dog and I get out of bed eventually. I feed her, do my morning routine, and then we drive to a park nearby. It's raining heavily and the park is completely empty. I feel my brain stem relax – this solitude is impossible to find in Seattle. We hike the trails and enjoy the quiet, the rain, and the mud. 10 a.m. — We get home and clean up. I start packing up the Airbnb and a friend texts me for a spontaneous coffee date. The dog has passed out in her kennel, so I leave her a Kong and go see my friend. She buys coffee for both of us and we catch up. 11:30 a.m. — Head back to the Airbnb and finish packing up before checking out and heading back home. We drive through Starbucks on the way and I get egg-white bites. J. treats. I'm crying a little about having to leave my friends and the town I love. 1:30 p.m. — Back in the city. We unpack and unwind on the couch a little bit, and then get intimate, which lifts my spirits greatly. We go for a run to Trader Joe's, which is a mile straight uphill, so I stretch a little before we go. The sun is shining and I need sunglasses. It feels so great to be outside, feeling healthy and using my body. At Trader Joe's we stock up on dried fruit and nuts and get sandwich fixings for dinner. J. pays. 2 p.m. — We walk back to the apartment, but I continue on foot to the co-op to buy spinach, tomatoes, tangerines, two grapefruits, a bottle of wine, a chocolate protein Odwalla, garlic-stuffed green olives, and pickled cherry peppers. $30.71 3 p.m. — Get home and feel motivated to do a Gorilla Workout. The workouts on this app are super well-designed; I highly recommend it for something cheaper than a gym membership that you can do in a small apartment. I focus on time and can generally complete one workout in 15 minutes. I get this one done in 10 and am immediately starving afterward, so I snack on olives and cheese. 5 p.m. — J. makes sandwiches for dinner while I jump in the shower with a glass of wine. I've actually gotten pretty good at three-minute showering, and it's just fine for a quick rinse after a workout. Then I hype myself up for a phone call with my mom. My relationship with her is not very good, and the phone convo produces a lot of material that I mentally file away for my next therapy appointment in a couple of days. 8 p.m. — I do my evening skincare routine and jump into bed with my new Elena Ferrante book. I previously read in one day because her style is so captivating. I'm exhausted, so I don't get too far into . Fall asleep with the light on and J. eventually comes to tuck me and the dog into bed. Daily Total: $30.71",7,255
"7:30 a.m. — After hitting snooze a few times, I finally drag myself out of bed. (I am not a morning person.) This is the latest I can sleep without being late to work or without my cats walking all over me until I feed them breakfast. I take a quick shower and use my trusty dry shampoo and mascara to hold me over for the day. Give my husband a quick kiss and I'm out the door by 8. 9:41 a.m. — I don't have much going on today, but already the morning seems to be going by fast. I've submitted a few files and have already spoken with a few retirees about their 401(k) and pension plans. 12 p.m. — Lunchtime! My company is very strict about making sure its employees take a full lunch hour, which is great. Since I live very close to work, I sometimes go home and eat, but today I brought leftovers from last night's Blue Apron meal. 5:18 p.m. — Just as I'm getting home from work and settling in, I get a text from a friend asking to meet for dinner. I haven't seen her in a while, so I say yes and head over to a local restaurant. My husband, B.*, meets us and I pay for my husband and me. The three of us spend the next few hours talking about our travel plans for the upcoming months. She's going to NYC in a few weeks and we are going to Europe in the spring. $37.38 Daily Total: $37.38",1,256
"7:10 a.m. — Wake up, feed the cats, and hop in the shower. I race around the house to find a pair of tights because it's warm enough to wear a dress. I need to buy another pair... I'm out the door by 8:05, which makes me eight minutes late for work. 12:05 p.m. — Since we went out for dinner last night, I don't have any leftovers to eat for lunch. Luckily, my company has a cafeteria with great food for great prices. I order the main entrée, grilled, herb-marinated chicken with mac and cheese and veggies. $5 5:30 p.m. — After work, I head over to my parents' place to use their treadmill. I'm training for a few races in the early summer but don't want to spend money on a gym membership. For now, I'll use my parents' equipment until it's not -5 degrees outside. Tomorrow should be nice enough to run outside. (The joys of Wisconsin weather! It can be -5 degrees one week and 45 the next.) 7 p.m. — My gas light comes on during the drive home and I make a stop. I drive a small SUV that gets good mileage and since my daily commute is less than three miles a day, this tank should last me at least two weeks. $25.10 Daily Total: $30.10",2,256
"7:10 a.m. — Normal showering morning routine, except this time, I nix the tights and decide on pants and my trusted Tory Burch riding boots. The weather has been nice enough that the city has stopped salting everything and I feel confident that I can wear them without them getting salty and ruined. 1 p.m. — The morning and early afternoon fly by. I peek at the shared calendar I have with my husband and notice we have nothing going on tonight. I want to do something since it's Friday, so I send B. a quick text to make plans. 2:15 p.m. — I check the Milwaukee Bucks schedule to see if they're playing tonight, which they are. We frequently go to Bucks games in the winter because it's a short, 40-minute drive up to Milwaukee and we both love sports. Once April comes, we'll shift our focus to our favorite sport, baseball, and our favorite team, the Milwaukee Brewers. I buy the tickets ($250) and request B.'s half through Venmo. $125 6 p.m. — B. and I head up to the Bucks game. We park a few blocks away from the arena to get cheaper parking ($15), which B. covers. Once we get inside, we stop at a concession stand and I pay for food and drinks ($30). We spend the evening cheering for Giannis and the rest of the Bucks. $30 Daily Total: $155",3,256
"9:30 a.m. — Since it's Saturday, I sleep in and try to ignore the cats pawing at our closed bedroom door. I love being able to sleep in and take my time in the morning. B. makes pancakes for us and I make a pot of coffee. Weekends are the only time where I really eat a full breakfast. Normally, I just grab a granola bar or muffin on the way out of the house. 11:30 a.m. — My dad texts me and asks if B. and I want to go the Wisconsin Badgers hockey game tonight. I am leery and reply, “How much?” since my dad normally makes me pay for these tickets. When he responds that I don't have to pay, I happily accept. 4:45 p.m. — We bum around for a little longer until we start to get ready for our day. First, we stop at my grandma's house to pick up the homemade chicken and dumpling soup she made for me. B. is worried about leaving the soup in the car, but since it's freezing outside, I'm not worried that it'll go bad. The two-hour drive to Madison really supports the farmer stereotype of Wisconsin – it's dairy farm after dairy farm! 6:45 p.m. — We get to Madison just in time for the game, and our tickets include parking. Once we get in, we go to the team store and wander around for a while before I pick out an Under Armour crewneck sweatshirt that is literally the softest thing I've ever felt in my life. It's a little more than I would normally spend, but the softness of this sweatshirt makes it worth it. $70 7:25 p.m. — After the first half, we decide to get food. We go to the nearest concession stand and order buffalo chicken fries for B. ($8.50) and a brat ($5.50) for me. I offer to pay, but he shoots me down, calling it a date night. Daily Total: $70",4,256
"10:30 a.m. — I sleep in a little later than normal today. B. has already woken up and let me sleep, bless him. I make my way to our basement, where I find a mountain of laundry to do. 1:30 p.m. — After binge-watching for a while, we hop in the shower and get ready for the day. B.'s out of shampoo, so I guess we are making a trip to Target today. 4:30 p.m. — We leave Target with a new flavor of Halo Top ice cream ($6.99), shampoo for B. ($2.99), socks for me ($9.99), and a bottle of wine ($13.99). On the drive home, I realize I forgot tights. How does this always happen? $35.83 5:30 p.m. — I start making our Blue Apron dinner and B. throws in a load of laundry. A perfect Sunday of doing nothing! Daily Total: $35.83",5,256
"7:20 a.m. — Back to the weekly grind. I struggle to wake up this morning, as I do every Monday. A quick shower, a swipe of mascara, and I'm out of the door by 7:55. 1 p.m. — I've been so immersed in work today that I forgot tomorrow is my birthday! I've only been with this company for five months now, but it seems like when it's your birthday here, you can bring in something for everyone. I look up a few cupcake recipes on Pinterest before settling on one of my classics: chocolate chip cookie dough cupcakes. 5:30 p.m. — I get off work a little later than usual and stop by the grocery store on the way home to buy the ingredients for cupcakes and fajitas for dinner tonight. $25.12 7 p.m. — After dinner, I do some yoga and then start on the cupcakes. I love baking, which definitely runs in my family. My mom, aunt, and grandma are all incredible bakers. I call my mom for her buttercream recipe. Daily Total: $25.12",6,256
"7:10 a.m. — Today's my birthday! It snowed six inches overnight, so I know I need to hustle this morning to get to work. My normal routine takes a little longer and I make it to work with the cupcakes by 8:03. 11 a.m. — I get a few texts from friends wishing me a happy birthday and confirming they can come to my birthday dinner. Most of my friends live all across Wisconsin, so I figured it would be easiest for everyone if dinner was on a Friday after work instead of in the middle of the week. 4 p.m. — I've been thinking about how much waste I throw away when I cook and have been researching countertop compost buckets for scraps. The one I want from Target just went on sale, so I quickly order it online and also throw in a sheet mask to treat myself. $22.87 7:05 p.m. — I call my insurance agent to find out if my car insurance will go down now that I'm 25; she tells me that it will go from $160/month to $156/month. I was expecting it to be more than that! Once B. turns 25, I hope it'll decrease even more. I know that some people don't enjoy their birthdays, but I think of it as a day all for myself. I can only assume that birthdays from here on out won't be as exciting, so I'll enjoy today while it lasts. Daily Total: $22.87",7,256
"6:10 a.m. — I struggle to get out of bed after the long weekend, but I put my gym clothes on and head out the door. If I don't go before work, I know I wont go at all! When I get home, I make breakfast (coffee and apple chia oatmeal) and prepare my lunch for the day. 8:35 a.m. — Off to work! I've been working at this organization for the last six months. My executive director can be a drag but I really love our mission and my other coworkers, so they help make up for it. My MetroCard ran out last Friday, so I refill it for another 30 days. 12:15 p.m. — I eat lunch in my office (chickpeas with a tomato sauce and cabbage salad on the side) and read Money Diaries. I limit eating out to twice a week because restaurants are so expensive here and, for some reason, I can't seem to spend less than $25 every time I go out to eat. I also love to cook, so I don't mind bringing my own food for lunch every day. 4 p.m. — I accidentally had a package sent to my last address in Boston and one of my old neighbors was kind enough to help me out by sending it to my Brooklyn address. I Venmo him for the cost of shipping. $12.80 7 p.m. — Get home feeling kinda meh (hello pre-period hormones!), but am pleasantly surprised to see that I got a letter from my grandfather in the mail. He lives in Paris, so I don't get to see him too often, but I'll be visiting in April and am so excited to spend time with him and my grandmother. I found roundtrip tickets for only $250 a few months back and bought them because it was too good a deal. I make a mental note to write him back ASAP. 8 p.m. — I make miso and veggie dumpling soup for me and my roommate. When she gets home, we eat and watch on Netflix, which is soooo good. I later get a phone call from my ex in California — we broke up eight months ago, but we're still friendly and chat on the phone once every few months. It makes me miss him (dammit!), especially considering we only broke up because we were moving to different places after college. I've gone on a few dates since we broke up, but all the guys ended up being dicks. I think it's a New York thing. Lately, I've been focusing on myself and have made a point not to look for dates. I've been feeling really great recently without the pressure of finding anyone. Self love FTW! We chat for an hour before I go to bed at 10. Daily Total: $12.80",1,257
"6:20 a.m. — I wake up and do my same usual morning routine: gym, shower, and breakfast, and am out the door by 8:30. My roommate leaves early for work today so I have the place to myself for a solid hour. I know I pay a lot for rent, but I absolutely love my apartment: We have a huge sliding door window with a view of Manhattan, a balcony, and huge rooms. It's the perfect place to relax after being in the hustle and bustle of Manhattan all day. 12 p.m. — It's been pretty slow today because both my supervisor and executive director are out of the office. I eat lunch (leftover dumpling soup that I added chickpeas to) and read some articles, including a really interesting one about the fruit/vegetable shortages in Alaska during the winter. I am so privileged to have access to a year-round farmer's market, which is why I'm happy to spend a little extra to support my local farmers. 1:45 p.m. — I'm still kind of hungry from lunch, so I cut up an apple I brought and munch on it while working on invitation designs. I bought a half bushel of barely bruised apples (around 20 pounds) for $12 at the market on Saturday and have been eating them nonstop. 3:30 p.m. — Get an email from ClassPass about a 70% off discount. I've been wanting to try it to take fun classes, since I just lift weights with minimal cardio at my old school gym. I decide against it for now but resolve to sign up the next time a good discount comes around. 4:30 p.m. — I get to leave an hour early from work, hooray! I rush home so I can take advantage of this strangely warm weather. I sit on my balcony and continue reading by Malcolm Gladwell. For the last few years, my New Year's resolution has been to read at least 25 books over the course of the year. With all my commuting, I've been able to get so much reading in! It's gorgeous outside and I start to feel so nostalgic for summer. 6:30 p.m. — I roast potatoes for dinner and add homemade sunflower seed ""cheese"" from making sunflower seed milk (which is way cheaper than almond) over the weekend and devour it while watching YouTube videos. After finishing dinner, I am craving something sweet but don't have a ton of snacks because I try to live zero waste and tend not to buy pre-packaged stuff. I end up mashing sweet potato and topping with cinnamon and maple syrup. It's certainly not ice cream, but it does the trick. I spend the rest of my night reading and writing a letter back to my grandfather. In bed by 9:30. Daily Total: $0",2,257
"6:10 a.m. — Feeling groggy when I wake up but I push past it and head to the gym. Today is chest day. I usually ask for a spotter because I'm benching pretty high (105!), and after a few rounds, one of the guys spotting me takes weight off the bar without asking and says I should go lighter. I would usually brush this off, but I've been feeling serious microaggressions from men lately and this really bugs me. I breeze through the lighter set and walk away. 7:15 a.m. — When I get home, I shower, make apple chia oats (creature of habit), and drink chai with sunflower seed milk. My roommate went out to dinner last night so I didn't get to see her before bed, but we chat a bit this morning before she heads off to work early. 12:30 p.m. — I heat up my lunch (sweet potato with chickpeas and spices) and decide to go into my office's conference room to eat and read my book. Ideally I'd be having lunch in Central Park, but it's grey and drizzly today. 1 p.m. — Back at my desk with apple chia pudding. I'm meeting a friend for dinner later and have zero intentions of eating healthy tonight, so I'm getting in nutrients while I can. 6 p.m. — I randomly run into this guy I went to college with and we chat for a few minutes as we get out of the subway. This is probably the seventh or eighth time I've run into someone I know in NYC, and it's still so insane to me every time it happens, especially considering I grew up in Texas. The guy gives me his number just before we part ways, and I plan on inviting him over the next time my roommate and I throw a party. 6:05 p.m. — Get to the burger joint and wait a few minutes until my friend arrives. We each order the Impossible Burger, which is totally vegan but ""bleeds"" like real meat! We catch up on each other's lives since we haven't seen each other in a few months, and end up sharing a coconut milkshake with avocado, lime, and coconut flakes that tastes like key lime pie. $23 8 p.m. — When I get home, I have two packages waiting for me! The first is a wooden frame for a poster in my room and mesh produce bags, and the other is a stainless steel French press I ordered because I broke my glass one over the weekend. When my roommate gets home, we do clay face masks (she works in beauty and gets tons of free products) and watch more I go to sleep around 11. Daily Total: $23",3,257
"6:30 a.m. — Woke up well before my 7:15 alarm this morning, but I stay and relax in bed while listening to a podcast my friend recommended to me: by Malcolm Gladwell. I get up to make breakfast and decide to boil potatoes for potato salad with a Dijon vinaigrette that I'll bring for lunch. 8:45 a.m. — While waiting for the train, I run into other friends from college (!) and chat with them until we get to our stops. We haven't seen each other in a while, so we talk about our jobs, my friend's experience in graduate school, and my sustainability blog. One of them asks to come to the farmer's market with me sometime soon and I happily say yes – I usually go by myself but love to have company with me! 12 p.m. — I eat potato salad with half an avocado I brought from home while attempting the crossword puzzle. My roommate texts me and asks if I want to go out for dinner tonight with her friends, and while I'd rather not spend money since I have food at home, she pressures me into it. I've spent less money than usual this week, so I don't mind too much. 3 p.m. — I see a theater matinée today (work perk) and get to leave a few hours early from work! The show we see is very strange and I don't understand a thing, but it's interesting to see the story unfold. Afterwards, I head home, since I have time to kill before meeting my friends for dinner. 6:15 p.m. — There's a homeless man on the train asking for money, and while I usually prefer to give food, I don't have any on me, so I give him a dollar. I didn't grow up in a place with so many homeless people and it's heartbreaking, so when I have the opportunity, I like to help. $1 6:30 p.m. — I get to the restaurant and meet up with my friends, but the place is super crowded so we end up going to another sushi spot a couple of blocks away. My roomie buys me a beer (I think she feels bad for pressuring me to go to dinner, but I gladly accept) and I order miso soup, a veggie California roll, and a sweet potato tempura roll. Before we all leave, she gives us gifts from her work: samples of a very chic perfume from one of her clients! It smells like spring and I'm so excited to wear it once the weather gets warmer. $14 8:30 p.m. — Right as we're about to catch the train home, my roommate's boyfriend calls and asks if we want to go meet him for drinks. We end up going to this weird dive bar and I order a Guinness. We stay for an hour and play Hangman, and by the time we get home at 11, I am fully exhausted and ready for bed. $7 Daily Total: $22",4,257
"8 a.m. — It's the weekend! I've gotten into a Saturday morning routine that I look forward to every week: wake up, hit the gym, come home and shower, eat breakfast, and take the bus (or walk if it's nice outside) to the farmer's market. It looks like it might rain soon, so I decide to walk along the bus route just in case I want to hop on. I bring my week's compost and a ton of reusable bags so I'm totally prepared. The rain holds off so I walk the hour there while listening to music. 11:30 a.m. — I get to the market and it's super busy. The weather is nice, so lots of folks bring their dogs and I even spot an actress from ! I buy red potatoes, sweet potatoes, mushrooms, bread, onions, a vegan chocolate chip cookie, and a beet, and put in another order for a half bushel of ""imperfect"" apples from the apple farmer. Americans waste nearly 40% of food, so I like buying fruit that otherwise wouldn't get sold. Hooray for saving money and the planet! I have plenty of dry goods like beans, rice, and oats left from a bulk trip last week, so this week's grocery haul is somewhat inexpensive. I usually spend around $50 per week. $27.80 3 p.m. — I make avocado toast for a late lunch with roasted butternut squash that I have leftover from last week. The roomie and I watch the rest 0f and try to wrap our heads around the ending. It's kind of confusing and we are hoping to get more answers when the next season comes out. 7:30 p.m. — I make pasta with the last of the homemade tomato sauce I froze from the summer. It's so much better than premade sauce, and I got a huge discount on bruised tomatoes from the market back in September. I watch some episodes of , scroll through Instagram, and do remote work for a co-op that I'm a member of. Chill night overall, and I'm in bed by 10:30. Daily Total: $27.80",5,257
"7:30 a.m. — Wake up, make breakfast (coffee and apple oatmeal), and finish my book while eating. I make a plan to read more Gladwell soon; he's a phenomenal writer. Next up: by John Irving (another amazing author). My tenth book of the year! 10:30 a.m. — Head off to the gym for leg day and then come home to shower and get ready for lunch with my roommate's mother and grandmother. They're stopping by our place for bellinis beforehand, so we make sure to deep clean the apartment so we look like responsible adults. 2:45 p.m. — We decide to go to Forrest Point in Bushwick, and I order a Mediterranean plate with Israeli salad, pita, hummus, harissa, and potatoes. I love my roommate's family and really enjoy chatting with them. Her grandmother treats us. 6:30 p.m. — I heat up leftover pasta from last night and do another face mask with my roommate. We decide to throw a party in a few weekends, since we have plenty of alcohol left over from our last party and love having friends over. I look online to see if I can find a planter for a plant I bought a few weeks ago, but can't find anything that fits my style. I go to sleep around 9:30. Daily Total: $0",6,257
"7:20 a.m. — Slept in for my rest day and made coffee and toast, which I topped with leftover roasted butternut squash. I'm all out of my usual toast toppers (PB, jam, avocado, hummus) but this turns out great! I also add nutritional yeast, red chili flakes, and salt, which is a delicious combo. I listen to music while getting ready for work. 10:30 a.m. — My executive director brought back pecan pralines from her trip to New Orleans and even got a few vegan ones especially for me! They're super delicious, and the southern treat really reminds me of home. 12:15 p.m. — I heat up my lunch (apple chia oats) and read articles while listening to music. I also start writing down cool restaurants I want to try when I visit Paris. That's another reason I'm trying to save up – I don't want to feel deprived while I'm there! While I definitely plan on having inexpensive picnics, I also want to try some of their fine foods apart from just baguette and salad. 2:30 p.m. — I spend the afternoon working on emails, social media, and website updates. I munch on another pecan praline and more leftover butternut squash for my snack. Just waiting for Monday to be over... 5:30 p.m. — I'm out of work! When I get home, I check my mailbox and see a letter from my mom, who sent me a $25 Target gift card she wasn't planning on using. She is such a sweetheart and I feel like we've become extra close the last few years, which I love. 7 p.m. — I roast potatoes and a beet and listen to an old Drake album. While that's roasting, I prep cabbage salad for the week as well as more sunflower seed ""milk."" I make more vegan cheese with the leftover pulp and add it to my roasted potatoes. After dinner, I'm craving something sweet again, so I make hot cocoa with water, sugar, and cocoa powder. Daily Total: $0",7,257
"10:30 a.m. — I wake up and learn that there's a story I need to work on. I'm a little irritated because it's going to take up my entire afternoon, and I become grouchier and grouchier about it as the day goes on. My boyfriend makes matzo ball soup with homemade broth we have in the freezer; it cheers me up a little, but my anxiety over work is pretty high. 3:30 p.m. — Finally done with work for the day; what a Sunday. It's rainy and gross out so we knock out our errands early and stay in for the rest of the day. I call an UberPool to Whole Foods. $2.89 3:45 p.m. — Spending money on “fancy” groceries is probably my biggest vice. I like to cook with food I'm excited about, and it makes me want to eat out a lot less. I grab ground chicken, kale, broccoli rabe, parsnips, chickpeas, steak tips, salsa, bell peppers, and a bag of honey-roasted chickpeas I keep in my desk to snack on ($58). My boyfriend picks up two bottles of wine, a bag of Linzer cookies for me and a few cans of cold brew, which he pays for. (He usually eats dinner at his office on weeknights, so most of our groceries are my stuff). $58 6 p.m. — I decompress from a stressful morning and afternoon by reading. I'm just getting to and am loving it, as a journalist myself. My boyfriend makes roasted sweet potatoes and broccoli over rice (a favorite Smitten Kitchen recipe) while I watch He's wonderful and we really work to support each other on days when one of us needs it. He sits down beside me and tolerates a full episode of the show. 8 p.m. — We make a pot of tea. (We're big on tea, less on coffee, in general). It turns into a solid Sunday after all. Daily Total: $60.89",1,258
"8:00 a.m. — Wake up just as my boyfriend is leaving for work. I get dressed and throw a breakfast round into the toaster oven. (We get them at Whole Foods, and I'm obsessed. Today's flavor is cranberry apple.) I make a cup of matcha too; it's way cheaper than buying coffee or a matcha latte at work, and healthier, too! I read and scroll through Instagram. 12:30 p.m. — For lunch, I eat leftover broccoli and sweet potato over brown rice with soy sauce. I really try to minimize how much I eat out during the week. (I'd say this played a huge role in how early I was able to pay off my loans after college.) 1:45 p.m. — I had a fairly successful no-shop January. As someone who freelances a lot, it's hard not to treat freelance income as “fun money” and not budget appropriately with it. To get over this, I'm really trying to only buy things I love and can't stop thinking about buying. So far this month, I've bought a pair of pants from Everlane that I think I'll wear all spring and summer. (I've officially decided I can no longer wear short shorts on a regular basis. RIP.) To that end, I see L.L. Bean is having a sale on summer clothing, and I find a seersucker sundress that can replace a white linen dress I've had for years, which is sadly too short for me now. $63.25 5:30 p.m. — On my walk home, I decide to be nice and pick up my boyfriend's dry cleaning since he's having a really busy week. It's cash only, but luckily, I actually have cash for once. He Venmos $5.40 me for it. 6:30 p.m. — I hop on a call with a creative recruiter I found on LinkedIn since I want to take on more copywriting projects. He's nice enough, but it sounds a little bit like a scam. I read reviews online and learn that people do like working with this agency. It's not for me, but I'll follow tomorrow with a ""thanks, but no thanks."" 7 p.m. — Dinner is leftover short rib, collard greens, fingerling potatoes, and matzo ball soup –what a feast! I snack on kalamata olives (my favorite) that I bought at the overpriced Whole Foods antipasto bar. Then I chow down while watching for the 500th time. I also embark on an ambitious lunch creation for tomorrow, and TOTALLY mess up – it turns out really gross, and I can't bring myself to package it up in Tupperware. I'm mad at myself for wasting steak tips, veggies, and an hour of my time. Dejected, I toss the whole production into the trash (so wasteful), and shower to try and de-stress. 10 p.m. — Remember I never invoiced one of the writing projects I just filed. I submit the invoice, looking forward to the $200 check that should come my way in two weeks. Then it's time for a little reading before I am tuckered out. My boyfriend texts to say he's leaving the office soon, but I fall asleep before he gets home. Daily Total: $63.25",2,258
"8 a.m. — Breakfast is a cranberry-orange whole wheat round and vanilla cold brew with almond milk. I really don't want to buy lunch, so I grab a frozen burrito and a Siggi's lemon yogurt. I throw deodorant, lipstick, and a perfume sample in my bag because I have a photoshoot for a freelance gig after work, and I want to feel somewhat put together. 12:15 p.m. — Several fire drills in the office since we're well into production for our spring issue. I clean up edits on an online piece that's running tomorrow. I also get an email from a client I'm eager to work with on freelance editing work, asking if I'd be interested in pursuing a new project for two or three hours a week. I'm so excited: It'll be about $400-$500 a month, regularly! Not pitching publications and brands for copy work is so nice, and having anchor clients is my dream as a freelancer. I accept and then happily eat my frozen burrito and Siggi's while reading Into The Gloss. 4 p.m. — I walk back to the office and try to finish last-minute tasks on my to-do list, like laying out a marketing email and chatting with our art department for my online piece that will run tomorrow. I also book a bike for a post-work spin class on Thursday because it's going to be over 50 degrees and that is TROPICAL in Boston this time of year. 5 p.m. — I have a photoshoot for a piece I wrote for one of my side-hustles, along with a friend who works on it with me. It's at a local wine store, and we are really excited about it. We hop on the T. $2.25 6 p.m. — The photoshoot is a blast, and we get to sample a few different wines. I ask for a recommendation and pick up a new Bordeaux. $22 6:30 p.m. — My friend and I want Greek food right across the street for dinner, so I break my no-eating-out-during-the-week rule because it's nice out and sometimes life is worth breaking your own rules for. I get a chicken gyro and we split fries. $9.50 8 p.m. — Time to plop down on the couch. I make a small pot of green tea and force myself to make lunch for tomorrow: refried beans, whole wheat tortillas, salsa, and cheddar. Daily Total: $33.75",3,258
"8 a.m. — I eat a hard-boiled egg for breakfast and make a quick mug of matcha. My boyfriend kisses me on his way out the door. 11:30 a.m. — I'm hungry earlier than anticipated, so I start picking away at my lunch. I'll be really hungry later, too. I can feel it. While eating, I look at lingerie and wish I'd bought something when there were Valentine's Day sales, even though I know I was being lured into the marketing. I interned at a lingerie brand when I was in college (it was a total nightmare) but it instilled a love of nice undergarments in me. There's a lovely boutique down the street from my office. I walk over on my lunch break with the intent to browse but leave with a Chantelle bra I love – a quality purchase! $50 6 p.m. — Once I'm home, I start cooking what turns out to be a very ambitious dinner for one. I wasn't expecting my boyfriend to make it home, so I thought I'd treat myself. It's ginger-maple ground chicken meatballs over pasta with broccoli rabe. Broccoli rabe is my favorite vegetable, but tricky to get right. I turn on music (Arctic Monkeys, the classics) and get to work. 7:45 p.m. — My boyfriend gets home relatively early and with a box of chocolates from Burdick's! I'm really pleased and surprised and eat three truffles at once. We make tea and catch up before bed. Daily Total: $50",4,258
"11:30 a.m. — I run an hourlong recurring meeting for our team twice a month. Initially, it was daunting to get up in front of so many people and be in charge, but it has turned into a great learning experience for me that I wouldn't trade. This one goes fairly smoothly, luckily. 3:30 p.m. — My day slows down considerably, so I walk around the corner for a cold brew. Surprise: it's way too late in the day for me to be drinking coffee, and I'm way too hopped up and borderline nauseous the rest of the day. $4.25 5:45 p.m. — Once I'm home, I work on freelance projects, trying to channel the energy into something productive. I pitch an editor a new idea for a piece, and he actually responds an hour later (rare) with the green light. At least I'm selling work in my queasy state. 10:30 p.m. — Pop a Pepto Bismol and crawl into bed. Daily Total: $4.25",5,258
"8 a.m. — Friday, glorious Friday! I make a smoothie with almond butter, blueberries, strawberries (I keep these frozen), and almond butter. Plus a sprinkle of matcha. 12:40 p.m. — I have a stressful morning at work. My copy is getting a ton of edits that I don't necessarily agree with, and it frustrates me more than it should. I do a Headspace session in my office, and then realize I just really don't want to eat my frozen burrito for lunch. A friend and I order Dig Inn on Caviar. I get the herb chicken marketplace bowl over farro with cashew Caesar and sweet potatoes. $16 5 p.m. — I'm meeting friends from my old office for drinks before we go to karaoke. I swing home to drop off my stuff and change before calling an Uber to the bar by our old office. It takes forever in traffic, but my phone says the T is very delayed so I thought this would be better (plus, I have 40% off of Uber for the week). $7.68 6 p.m. — I buy a Corona and pay in cash, which sucks because I can't budget well when I don't use my card. Catching up with old colleagues is fun, though! $3.50 7 p.m. — We walk to a Japanese place down the street because we figure the trendier spots near the karaoke spot will all have terrible wait times. We were right: This restaurant only has a 25-minute wait. We each get a sake cocktail at the bar while we wait for our table. I order soba in warm miso broth with fried bean curd and fish cakes. $38 10 p.m. — Several rounds of drinks later, my work week exhaustion is catching up with me at karaoke. I stick to gin and tonics to avoid a hangover tomorrow morning (mixing liquors is my downfall) and am pleased that everything is fairly cheap. $25 10:45 p.m. — We debate staying for another set, but there's a great restaurant across the street. We get raw cookie dough and profiteroles for dessert. I order a personal pot of sencha, feeling very adult about this decision. $13 12 a.m. — I walk home and it's freezing out. My boyfriend is also out with friends and isn't home yet. In the mirror, I notice my face looks really dehydrated (probably because am dehydrated), so I do a face peel followed by a hydrating mask after taking a quick shower. I also drink a lot of water and watch an episode of before my boyfriend gets home. Daily Total: $103.18",6,258
"10 a.m. — Not hungover! A bit achy, but that might have been all the sugar before bed. We make breakfast burritos with eggs, veggies, and refried beans. 11:45 a.m. — The weather's fairly nice out (for Boston in the winter) so we go to a museum. My Charlie Card is out of money again, so I reload for us to take the T there. I have free admission at the museum through work. $20 3 p.m. — After a full afternoon of walking around, we're both pretty hungry. We stop at by Chloe for lunch, where I get a black bean burger and sweet potato fries for us to share. This place is good but definitely overpriced. $15 6 p.m. — While walking around the stores on Newbury, I find lightweight linen pants at Marine Layer that I know I'll live in this summer (drawstring waists forever!) — and there's a 15% discount. $83 6:30 p.m. — We stop at Trader Joe's to buy groceries for dinner tonight (lentils, kale, and chicken apple sausage soup) and staples like oatmeal, tofu, and almond milk. Also, crumpets for breakfast, because they're so good. We split it evenly. $25 7 p.m. — Back home, we get cooking while watching mindless television. It's an easy recipe with a long cook time (about an hour and a half), so we want to get things going as quickly as possible. 9:30 p.m. — After dinner, we rent a movie on Amazon Prime through our Roku. I fall asleep way earlier than I mean to. Daily Total: $143",7,258
"8 a.m. — I wake up feeling lazy, so I grab a cup of coffee and relax while watching on Food Network. I've been hooked on cooking shows lately, even though I would never bother to make any of the recipes. I finally get up and make breakfast: eggs, garlic rosemary potatoes, and toast for my boyfriend and me. I'm not usually a big breakfast eater, but I'm hungry today. Then I get myself ready for the day and run errands. 12:15 p.m. — I spent most of the day yesterday working on our house, and need to get a few things to tie together the bathroom I just painted. The house is from the 1920s and I love the charm its age brings, but one downfall is the super tiny bathrooms. First stop is HomeGoods to find a new shower curtain. I don't find one I like, but I pick up new kitchen towels ($10), a utensil holder ($9.99), and a shower curtain liner ($5.99). Next stop is a little Mexican place close to my house that makes amazing guacamole ($3.02). We're going to a friend's place later and I'm bringing chips and guac. $29 1 p.m. — Next, I stop by Target and score a curtain on sale ($7.48), plus a few groceries, including a bag of Sour Patch Kids ($15.78). $23.26 4:55 p.m. — Arrive at my friend's home, which is about 20 minutes away. It's beautiful, but something about a neighborhood where all the houses are identical except for their varying shades of beige kinda creeps me out. I have a good time seeing friends, drinking a few Coors Lights, and stuffing my face with queso. Daily Total: $52.26",1,259
"7:01 a.m. — Woke up a bit late this morning after hitting snooze too many times. Quickly get in the shower, get ready, and make a quick smoothie of frozen cherries, half a banana, almond and coconut milk, and a bit of organic yogurt. It's delish! Pack that to bring along to work, feed the pup, and head out the door. I have a half hour commute in, so I finish my coffee on the road. 11:35 a.m. — Lunch is being catered today and I wander down to find food. I get a house salad, fruit, and a roll — I don't know who picked the restaurant but the food is terrible. As predicted, I'm starving by 2 p.m. But, hey, it was free. 5 p.m. — I make a quick payment on my credit card before leaving the office ($142). I try to use credit cards for almost all purchases and then pay my entire balance each month. It feels safer than using my debit card, and I like the bonus of getting points and cash back. My commute home is annoying and takes longer than usual. I'm really hungry when I get home and immediately inhale leftover chicken tacos with cilantro lime rice. YUM. I take the pup for a walk, watch a few episodes of , and crash by 10:30. Daily Total: $0",2,259
"6:50 a.m. — Wake up, shower, grab coffee, and get ready for the day. I make a smoothie and feed the pup before heading out the door. Arrive at work just before 8:30 and start going through emails. I have a meeting right at noon, so I heat up my leftover chicken and rice to eat at my desk a little early today. 4:38 p.m. — Leave the office and go to a friend's birthday dinner. We're meeting at a Russian restaurant in St. Paul, so it's a bit of a trek. On my way, I buy a nice bottle of sparkling wine ($33) from a nearby wine shop. I arrive 15 minutes late per usual, but no one minds. I order a Moscow Mule and chicken Kiev for dinner ($38). It's tasty and the portion is huge, so I plan to bring half home. I have a great time and get to try a new place, which I love to do. $71 8:50 p.m. — Back at home, my boyfriend is finally replacing the light in the bathroom. (We've had to use a lamp for the past few days.) We also decide to change the fan — the joys of home renovation never end! Daily Total: $71",3,259
"7:50 a.m. — Finally roll out of bed feeling a little tired. Luckily I'm working from home today, so I don't have to venture out into the cold. I'm over this winter and ready for warmer weather. I make myself a smoothie and a cup of coffee and get to work. I check my personal email and notice an email from my doctor's office letting me know about a bill I need to pre-pay, which catches me by surprise a little. I'm going through IVF and recently had my egg retrieval, but I ended up having to freeze all the eggs due to being overstimulated. I wasn't expecting an extra cost for that, so I'm feeling a little bummed out. The process has been pretty intense, physically and financially. I make the payment so we can schedule the frozen transfer and send an email to the business office. $2,750 1 p.m. — I heat up my leftovers for lunch today and they're a little dry. Blah. Later, I take a quick break and walk the dog. Not my favorite things to do when its 15 degrees out, but it's not as bad as I anticipated. 5:30 p.m. — Boyfriend gets home and brings groceries. I usually do the cooking but he's in charge tonight. Steak, potatoes, and veggies are on the menu. He's not the greatest of cooks, but I appreciate the effort. We relax after dinner and I'm in bed by 10:30 p.m. Daily Total: $2,750",4,259
"6:55 a.m. — Roll out of bed and start my usual routine. I remind myself to look for a fan replacement with a light because it felt a little dark in the shower this morning. I make a smoothie and drink my coffee while I get ready. 8:20 a.m. — Go through my pending items for the day at work. I have a long meeting at 9 that ends early (yay!), so I'll have a little more time to work on other projects. I take a minute to make a quick payment on my Nordstrom card ($187). I bought a new Rebecca Minkoff laptop bag on sale last month. I'm trying to get better about spending on things I want versus need, and this was a little slip up. $187 12:20 p.m. — A coworker asks if I want to grab lunch; since I didn't bring anything with me today, I'm game. We end up at Crisp & Green, which I haven't tried before. I get the fiesta bowl with chicken, black beans, avocado, peppers and brown rice. The bowl is good and large, so I save almost half for tomorrow. $12.51 1:30 p.m. — Back at work, I remember it was my mom's birthday earlier this week. I Venmo my sister my half of the cost of our gift to her. $33 5:45 p.m. — Get home from work and make dinner: pasta with chicken, capers, and artichokes. I make pasta often because its so easy and I love it. Chat with the boyfriend about a call I had with my doctor's office. I'm so over this IVF process and just want it to be done. I drink a glass of wine and we relax watching the Wild hockey game (they lose). I'm in bed by 10:30. Daily Total: $232.51",5,259
"6:25 a.m. — TGIF! I'm up a little earlier than usual today because I have an early meeting, at least a half hour away. I arrive right on time and work from there until about noon. I decide not to go into the office and work from home for the rest of the day. I swing by the car wash on my way back, which I've been putting off for too long. My SUV is covered in salt and dirt. I wait in line for roughly 30 minutes but in the end it's worth it. I was starting to forget what color my vehicle was! $11 6 p.m. — My sisters swing by my house at 6 p.m. because we're going to a visitation for my aunt's ex-husband, who just passed. I haven't seen him in many years but we want to show support for the family. We bring a card and I contribute money. $10 8 p.m. — The event is nice and afterwards, we're hungry, so we go to a bar to meet up with friends and grab a snack. We end up at one of my fave places on Eat Street. I get two Summit EPAs and French fries. Afterwards, we swing by a pinball bar and I play a few games. I'm terrible, so I give away my extra tokens ($2). $17 10:45 p.m. — I'm tired and and grab an Uber home. Pretty much go straight to bed at 11. $10.88 Daily Total: $48.88",6,259
"8:30 a.m. — Saturday morning! I love lazy weekend mornings and I'm feeling extra lazy today. I spend a good part of the morning snuggling with my pup and drinking coffee. At 10:30 a.m., I finally get up to make breakfast. My boyfriend is working on the house, so I make us eggs and breakfast potatoes. Then it's back under the blankets on this freezing cold morning to go shopping online. I'm looking for storage cabinets and a new vanity for my bathroom. Nothing is really doing it for me, and it doesn't help that my options are limited because my bathroom is so small. I also look on Google Flights for weekend trip ideas. I'm dying to get out of this miserable weather and I need sun! It's mostly wishful thinking, though, as I likely won't have time in between upcoming work trips. 5 p.m. — I spend the rest of the day cleaning my house and attempting to clean out my closet (rather unsuccessfully). We get sushi for dinner and order our usual spicy tuna, California roll, and shrimp tempura to-go from a little place by our house that we love. I also get the green curry with shrimp because I love having leftovers and their curry is so good and spicy. My boyfriend picks up the food and pays, and we spend the rest of the evening drinking wine and watching hockey. Daily Total: $0",7,259
"7 a.m. — I get out of bed and start getting ready for work. Make coffee in my French press and take my meds while I wait for the conference call to start. 7:30 a.m. — The call is for a service club that was created to help the organization I work for, and as usual, I wonder why I'm on it. I never contribute anything, so joining them each month feels a bit pointless to me. Still, the club itself is fantastic and does great work, and I don't have complaints about that. During the call, I keep myself on mute and check my bank account. I see that our immigration checks have cleared and am over the moon! Our first application was rejected because of bounced checks, so this is a huge deal. 8 a.m. — Leave for the office a little late. 9 a.m. — The team meets to discuss our upcoming summer camp, which is going to be wonderful this year (mainly because we are all on the same page about everything). 10:25 a.m. — Start contacting my families to check in with them. There's one in particular that my manager wants to make sure we help. 11:30 a.m. — Tell my manager I'm leaving for lunch and she stops me to discuss my impending move. Basically, she doesn't think I'm ready yet (neither do I) and says there are a lot of factors that need to be reviewed and discussed beforehand, which I completely agree with. Eventually, I leave and go to McDonald's, where I order a 10-piece McNugget combo with a Coke. $6.47 12:45 p.m. — Back at the office. I spend my time preparing for an event we have at work this week and updating my case notes. We do this event monthly and at this point, it's second nature to me. 5 p.m. — The clock strikes 5 and I'm ready to go, but our intern's Lyft hasn't arrived yet. I wait with her until it comes. 5:45 p.m. — I take my husband to the YMCA for his spin class and then make my way to Wendy's because I'm starving. I order a ""Son of a Baconator,"" fries, and a Coke. When I finish eating, I turn on the Uber Driver app and ride around to see if I can get any fares, but no dice. $8.51 6:30 p.m. — Pick up my husband and we head home. I watch TV while he showers and makes dinner. He reminds me that I still need to watch Sunday's episode, and I turn it on. I think about going out and Uber-ing again, but I decide to stay home and have a glass of wine instead. 9 p.m. — Bedtime! My left ear clogs up while I'm trying to fall asleep, which means I won't hear well tomorrow. Daily Total: $14.98",1,260
"7 a.m. — Usual morning routine: meds and getting ready for work. 7:30 a.m. — I'm ready early and have time to stop at Starbucks. The balance on my Starbucks card is low, so I add $10. I order a venti white chocolate mocha with an extra espresso shot and head to work. $10 8 a.m. — Same thing as yesterday: prepare for the family event and update my case notes. It's a boring week at the office. 12:45 p.m. — Leave for lunch. My manager talks me into trying a popular (and cheap!) Japanese place. I order hibachi steak that comes with mushrooms and carrots, and it's delicious! I wonder why I've waited this long to try it. After I eat, I visit my husband at home until it's time for me to go back to work. $7.83 1:45 p.m. — Back to the office for more case calls! 5 p.m. — I turn on the Uber app and remind the intern that I'm an Uber driver, so I can take her home sometime. We wait for her Lyft again together. After she leaves, I get a ride request! 5:10 p.m. — Drop off my passenger and check for. other potential rides. My husband is at the Y until 6:30, so I have time to kill. I get a ride request an hour later from a town in the opposite direction. I take it and finish right at 6:30. At least I made some extra money! 6:40 p.m. — Pick up my husband and we go home. He suggests ordering pizza, which I'm all for, and we decide on Domino's. I order a medium pepperoni pizza and he builds his own. I add an order of chocolate lava cake — SO good. He pays. 7:25 p.m. — I notice that our order status has changed a couple of times and call to see where the pizza is. The dispatcher says they are low on delivery drivers and that the wait is two hours, so I go pick up the food in person and request a refund for the delivery fee. 7:50 p.m. — We eat and watch TV as usual, and I have a glass of wine. My cat cuddles with me and I fall asleep on the couch in the middle of . Daily Total: $17.83",2,260
"7:50 a.m. — Leave for the office. I research how much an outstanding traffic ticket might cost me. Today is the court hearing and I'm extremely nervous. I got a citation for going 92 miles per hour in a 70 mph zone when I was out. of town for work a few months ago. Luckily, I have an affordable lawyer who can go to court for me. 8 a.m. — I distract myself with event preparation and a couple of research projects I've been putting off, but it doesn't completely help. I feel a panic attack coming on and text my two best friends to help me calm down. They're a lot of help, and I grab a water bottle from the office fridge. 12:15 p.m. — My manager goes home for the day since she's feeling sick, and I go to Starbucks for Double-Star Day. I already need to reload my card again (that was fast!) and put another $10 on it. Then I go to McDonald's (again) and order a 10-piece nugget and fries. I'm stress-eating like crazy this week, but eating out at lunchtime also gives me time to myself that I don't really get now that I'm married. I love my husband — but we introverts need solitude now and then. $16.46 12:45 p.m. — Stop at Spinx on the way back for gas. $15.01 1 p.m. — Distract myself with case notes and research until it's time for my meeting. It's a bi-monthly meeting where local nonprofits come together to learn about other community resources, events, and fundraisers. It's also an opportunity for agencies to get advice on how to handle certain cases. 1:45 p.m. — Leave for the meeting and struggle to find a place to park. The parking in downtown Spartanburg is awful. I'm one of the last people to arrive, so I get a pretty terrible seat. Today's organization isn't one I'll be using (for now), so I feel a bit out of place — but, at least it gets me out of the office for a bit! 2:45 p.m. — Check our mail and procrastinate more by registering for an upcoming young professionals event (it's free for members) and filling out their member survey. My job pays for my membership, so this is totally work-related, right? 3:50 p.m. — Husband suggests I call my lawyer, and I do. It's great news: the judge reduced my speed to nine miles per hour over the limit and my insurance may go up, but that's it! No driving school, suspension, or anything major, which I was nervous about — I'm thrilled. I call my husband to tell him, but he doesn't pick up. I also text my parents and my best friends from earlier. What makes it even sweeter is that I have 40 days to pay the fine and court costs. 5 p.m. — Turn on Uber so I can get a ride request from the intern to take her home. Somehow, another request gets to me first, and it's a long ride (which means more money), so I take it. 5:25 p.m. — This lady is going to the Charlotte airport! I drive her up there and we have a great conversation before I drop her off and drive home. I try to find more rides on the way back, but no luck. 8:30 p.m. — Come home, change clothes, grab pizza and wine, and plop on the couch with my husband. We watch last week's and I am slightly disappointed. 9:20 p.m. — Cuddle my husband until I fall asleep. Daily Total: $31.47",3,260
"6:15 a.m. — I wake myself up by some miracle. I consider getting out of bed and being productive but I've been a terrible wife lately, so I stay in bed and hug my sleeping husband. 7 a.m. — Usual morning routine, but today, I add makeup to the mix! I don't wear it all the time but today is a big day: not only is is the monthly family event, but I'm also doing hospital visits in Greenville. While I get ready, I add $20 to my Starbucks card. $20 7:35 a.m. — I've been skipping my daily meditations for a couple of weeks, which has made my anxiety increase. I take a minute to meditate using the Aura app, and I feel better already. 9 a.m. — Arrive at the hospital only to learn my first appointment has been moved to tomorrow. Sometimes communication isn't my families' strong suit. I text the other families I'm visiting to see if they want anything from the cafeteria. They don't, but I need coffee. I go to the Starbucks in the hospital's cafeteria and order a grande hazelnut latte. I pay with the app. 11:15 a.m. — Stop at the gas station, which has a McDonald's. I get something to eat and pay for it with my work credit card ($6.47 expensed) since it's a business trip. $20 12:10 p.m. — Back at the office, I start to get nervous about the event tonight, even though I know it'll be fine. I also still haven't gotten the email from my lawyer about how to handle the fees I owe, so I'm very nervous about that, too. For a slow week at the office, it's turning out to be high-anxiety! 3:25 p.m. — Starting to feel sick... 4 p.m. — Go home to have a moment alone and pick up my husband. He is not home and I'm irritated at his lack of time management skills. 4:30 p.m. — Leave for the event, which is at a church. (These events are not designed for atheists like me.) The moment at home does make me feel much better, and I ask my friend (who is coming to volunteer) if she can pick up my husband on her way over. 6 p.m. — I eat some of the catered food; as usual, it's terrible. It's baked ziti (which was not what I asked them to deliver), salad, and garlic bread. 6:25 p.m. — Break out the birthday cake and sing to the February birthdays! The cake is gone by the time I want some, so I miss out. Once everyone finishes their cake, they break out into their groups. One of the moms leaves her disabled baby with me, which I'm uneasy about. But I manage – he's a sweetheart! 7:25 p.m. — Ask my husband, friend, and the intern to start cleaning the crafts up. Thankfully it's almost time to leave! 7:45 p.m. — Finally done! The intern isn't feeling Uber today (understandable), so I take her home. 8:10 p.m. — Meet my husband and friend at our favorite brewery for a beer. I LOVE the Hefeweizen here. I order one and join them. My husband orders hummus and pita with his beer (he pays for his order), so I help him finish that while we talk about the night and other goings-on in our lives. $6.40 9:30 p.m. — We close out and head home. Husband and I stay up talking for a bit before I cave in and go to bed. Daily Total: $46.40",4,260
"7 a.m. — I finish my morning routine early and I treat myself to a Friday Starbucks (paying with my Starbucks card) before heading to the office. 7:45 a.m. — I get to the office early and have more time to get little things done! 11:10 a.m. — I remember that I need to schedule an immigration medical exam for my husband. I call and set an appointment for Tuesday morning, and tell my manager that I will be late that day. I call my husband about the appointment and he says USCIS sent him an email saying they will refund one of our filing fees. They won't talk to me without him there, so I have to wait until we're both available. 11:40 a.m. — I meet my husband for lunch at a nearby deli. It has amazing sandwiches that are made with local, organic ingredients. We both order spinach wraps with pulled chicken, cheese, avocado, and tomato with special mayo. He orders water and I have sweet tea. I pay. $23 12:45 p.m. — Husband sends me the rest of the money we need for his exam via PayPal. I drop him off and go back to work. USCIS calls when I park and, yet again, they can't tell me anything. Sigh. 12:50 p.m. — Husband texts me to see if he can add the Latino package to our cable account. It's $7.99 for 40 channels and it means fewer video downloads, so I say yes. Now we can watch our favorite Spanish shows at home! 5 p.m. — After a long afternoon of discussions, calls, texts, emails, and filing, it's FINALLY the weekend! I pick up my husband at home so we can run errands. We go to Supercuts first for haircuts and I get an eyebrow waxing as well. (We each pay for our own haircuts.) $52 7 p.m. — We go to the grocery store and buy milk, bread, and a frozen pizza. Between the two stores, the total is $5.76 for everything. I love my cheap grocery stores. $5.76 7:45 p.m. — Husband puts the pizza in the oven and we watch TV. I plan on Uber-ing later, so I only drink a small glass of wine. 8:50 p.m. — My tired brain thinks it's a good idea to take a short nap before driving...but I fall asleep and don't wake up until the next morning. Daily Total: $80.76",5,260
"8 a.m. — Get up, get dressed, and turn on Uber. It's gross and rainy, which makes me think it'll be a good day for rides. I stop at Starbucks for a latte and pay with my app. 2 p.m. — I only get one ride all day and I feel a bit defeated. I go home to get ready for a dinner date with the hubby. I make an extra effort to look nice, which means curling my hair. It turns out okay, but I do end up with a nice burn on the left side of my neck. Ouch. 5:15 p.m. — Eat at the gourmet burger place downtown. We order mac and cheese, brussels sprouts, and fancy burgers with fries. Hubby orders a Heineken and I get a Moscow Mule. Our waitress isn't that great, so I don't tip her as well as I normally would. I pay. $57 6:15 p.m. — Go for a drink at the brewery next door to the restaurant. We each get a beer and play a lot of foosball. I lose every time. $10 7:15 p.m. — Go to Ingles to get something chocolatey to share and other miscellaneous items. Husband buys deodorant and I get ear drops and a few other things. On the way to the self-checkout, I spot Reese's, which I've been craving for weeks. I buy three bags just because ($12). $39.17 7:40 p.m. — Go home and watch our favorite show from Spain on the couch for the rest of the night. Daily Total: $106.17",6,260
"9 a.m. — Get up, get dressed, and go to feed and walk my boss' dogs. She and her husband live very close to us, so she asks us to watch their dogs when they're out of town. She graciously pays us, even though I would do it for her for free. After the. walk, I turn on Uber. I'm immediately busy and it takes me to Greenville. At some point, I stop at McDonald's for a biscuit, two hash browns, and a latte, though none of it is very satisfying. $8.50 11:35 a.m. — Take a break to visit a friend who's still in college at her apartment. We talk about random stuff and our plans for tonight; her dad is coming to town and wants to take us to dinner. The timing still isn't set, so I tell her to let me know when my husband and I should get to her apartment later. I stop at the McDonald's near the complex for fries and a Coke to try and make up for yesterday's letdown. From there, I get back on the road. I'm not as busy as before, but I still get some rides here and there. $3.12 2:55 p.m. — Get home and I'm exhausted, so I opt for a nap before getting ready for dinner. It goes longer than planned and when I wake up, we're rushed. 5:15 p.m. — Feed and walk the dogs before I go to Greenville. 7 p.m. — Go to dinner at a very fancy restaurant in downtown Greenville and it's AMAZING! We order two bottles of wine, split two appetizers of beef tenderloin bites and crab dip, each order an entrée (I order the coq au vin), and share sides of asparagus, gouda mashed potatoes, and mushrooms. To top it all off, we share tres leches cake and crème brûlée. My friend's dad pays. 10 p.m. — Husband and I head home, not realizing how late it is! We stop at my boss' house to walk the dogs one more time, but my husband tells me to go home and says he'll do it for me; he's the best. I have trouble getting to sleep, so when he comes home, he joins me in bed and helps me doze off. Daily Total: $11.62",7,260

I walk to a salad bar near the office for lunch. $13.32 7:25 p.m. — My slow day gets busier, and I end up staying later than usual to wrap a project. I take the L home. $2.50 7:50 p.m. — On my walk home, I swing by a CVS to buy a six-pack of beer, bacon, and yogurt. My boyfriend is staying over this weekend and I want to stock up on the essentials. $19.54 8:20 p.m. — My friend's new beau is in a band and I promised her I'd drop by to watch him play. By the time I get home, change out of my work clothes, and do my hair, it's late! I grab an Uber to save time. $7.17 8:30 p.m. — I get to the bar and pay the cover charge ($5). The band is surprisingly good and I have a great time catching up with my friend. I meet her guy between sets; he is her exact opposite and they are adorable together. I drink a couple of beers during the show ($12). $17 10:30 p.m. — After the concert, people are still hanging out, but my boyfriend texts me that he's already at my apartment.

We stay in bed cuddling, listening to NPR, and chatting past noon. 1:30 p.m. — We decide to see and walk to a movie theater about a mile away. My boyfriend buys tickets online and I pay him back with cash. The movie is hilarious! We laugh the whole way through it. $14 4:45 p.m. — As soon as it's over, I realize I'm starving. We go to a nearby Nando's Peri-Peri, where we share chicken wings and a wrap and each have a glass of sangria. We split the bill. $22 5:45 p.m. — It's cold and rainy out, so we catch a bus back to my place.

"10 a.m. — I hoped for another lazy Sunday, but instead, my boyfriend drops a bombshell over breakfast: ""Where do I see this relationship going?"" because it turns out he doesn't see it going anywhere. My boyfriend of three years is breaking up with me. We spend an awful morning talking, crying, and sitting in stony, awkward silence. Finally, he suggests going outside to get some sun. 1 p.m. — We walk on the path along Lake Michigan and fall into our easy chatter. We're so comfortable and warm together; it feels like a normal Sunday for an hour or so. 2:15 p.m. — As we're walking back to my place, we pass by a grocery store. I need to stock up for the week and my boyfriend offers to help me carry the groceries. I buy LaCroix, cucumbers, yogurt, eggs, hummus, grapefruit, green onions, paper towels, and cleaning spray. $30.58 3 p.m. — As soon as we get back to my place, the awkwardness returns. He tells me he's holding me back from living my best life. I thought my best life included dating my best friend. I guess I was wrong. 5:30 p.m. — My boyfriend leaves. I tell myself I'm going to be fine but a few minutes later, I notice that he's removed all of his stuff from my bathroom cabinet and I start crying. I moved to Chicago a few months ago for work and haven't made any close friends yet. I feel very alone. 6 p.m. — I spend the evening in and finish reading a book on my Kindle ( ).

"5:45 a.m. — I wake up much earlier than normal and decide to hit the gym for a spin class. This is not something I would normally do but now seems like a good time to start building good habits. I'm feeling good through most of spin class until a song comes on that reminds me of my now ex-boyfriend, and I tear up. I try to cover it up by burying my face in my sweat towel. After class, I shower and change at the gym. 7:30 a.m. — I start to feel a little faint as I leave the gym. I forgot to bring a water bottle to class, so I buy one from the gym's juice bar on my way out. $2.73 7:35 a.m. — Catch a bus to work. $2.25 8:10 a.m. — I buy a latte on my way into the office. Once I settle in at my desk, I realize I have no work to do and fret at the prospect of being alone with my thoughts. I read somewhere that if you feel like you're about to cry, taking a drink will stop the impulse. I carry a bottle of water around all day, just in case. Fortunately, several senior associates come in to ask for help on my new case. I spend the morning jumping between conference calls and working on a brief. $4.51 12:15 p.m. — A few new attorneys started this week, so our office catered lunch for everyone to get to know them. I grab a salad, grilled chicken, and a cookie. 2:30 p.m. — My busy afternoon hits a lull and I pull out my cell phone to check my messages. Big mistake: My ex sent me a text asking if I'm okay. He sounds genuinely concerned and I immediately start tearing up. 3:30 p.m. — An hour after the first text, my ex sends another saying yesterday didn't go the way he planned — then he calls. I ignore the call, feeling like I might burst into tears at any moment. I walk to a coffee shop a few blocks away, order a cappuccino, and leave my phone at the office. $4.45 5:30 p.m. — I still have a fair amount of work to do and decide to grab tacos from Chipotle for dinner before diving back into work. $8.21 7:15 p.m. — I leave work and take the L home. $2.50 8 p.m. — There's a bar near my apartment that hosts swing dancing on Monday nights. I wouldn't normally go dancing but I'm trying to do all the things I put on hold while dating this guy. I pay the cover charge ($7), dance for a few hours, and buy a beer ($6 including tip). Things are going well until a really handsome guy asks me to dance. I get nervous and lose track of my steps. $13 10 p.m. — While walking home, I pass by a Chipotle. I buy chips and salsa, my comfort food of choice. $2.21 10:15 p.m. — At home, I try something else I wouldn't normally do: watching on my laptop since I'm too proud to watch anything on my ex's Netflix account. I've never seen this show but I figure now is a good time to start. Arie is kind of cute but seems really fake. I judge him for kicking a perfectly nice girl off the show. Daily Total: $39.86",4,261
"5:30 a.m. — I set an early alarm last night to go to the gym, but I wake up with an upset stomach and decide not to go; it was probably the late night chips and salsa. I stay in bed for an hour, browsing on my phone and cuddling with my cat. 7 a.m. — I clean up around the house, eat a grapefruit for breakfast, and spend half an hour trying on different outfits. Nothing seems right. All of my clothes seem too colorful or too baggy or just plain ugly. I start piling things up to donate to Goodwill. 7:30 a.m. — I take the L to work. $2.50 8:15 a.m. — I pick up a cappuccino on the way into the office. $4.45 1 p.m. — After a busy morning, I realize I still haven't had lunch. I go to a salad bar near my work and get my usual giant salad. I Google ""how to get over a breakup"" while I pick at my salad. I'm feeling bold and delete my texts with my ex on my phone. Then I go to Facebook to unfriend him and tear up seeing his profile photo. I took it a month ago — he looks so happy! Unfriend-ing him is a big emotional moment for me. I don't have my usual appetite, and end up tossing most of the salad. $13.89 5:45 p.m. — It's a fairly unproductive day at work. I'm tired and it's hard to focus on anything. I decide to leave even though I haven't made as much progress on my case as I'd hoped I would. 6 p.m. — I swing by the gym near my office for quality time on the StairMaster. The workout distracts me from my ex (like magic!) and I feel much better afterward. I shower and change at the gym. 7:15 p.m. — I stop at Target and buy three new workout shirts in different colors, a pair of socks, and a padlock to use at the gym. $45.28 8:15 p.m. — I get back to my apartment and cook tacos for dinner. I watch on my laptop. Alicia Florrick is so cool; she wouldn't let a breakup slow her down! Daily Total: $66.12",5,261
"5:30 a.m. — I set an early alarm in the hopes of making it to an early yoga class, but I sleep in instead. 8 a.m. — I skip breakfast and take the L to work. $2.50 8:45 a.m. — I buy a latte on my way into the office. Work is better today; I feel like I can focus again! I play Taylor Swift on Spotify all morning. I bet she's the one who does the breaking up, not the one who gets dumped. $4.51 1 p.m. — After wrapping up a big court filing, I eat a yogurt that I brought from home and grab a sandwich left over from a deposition. I Google: ""how to win at a breakup."" 5:30 p.m. — I have more work ahead and pick up a burrito bowl from Chipotle before getting back to work. Lots to catch up on since I spent the first couple days of the week zoning out! $7.71 7:35 p.m. — I swing by the gym and watch more of while I work out on the elliptical. 8:50 p.m. — I swing by Target (again) to buy a few pairs of underwear (racy, all black). $35.04 9:10 p.m. — I catch a bus home. $2.25 9:40 p.m. — A box of HelloFresh is waiting on my doorstep, for which I'm charged today. I started ordering these intermittently after my boyfriend complained about my cooking and I'll probably stop getting them now. I cook pesto sausage pasta and split it into containers for lunch later this week. $60 9:45 p.m. — The IRS sent me a letter – they reviewed my taxes from last year and I still owe them money. I don't think it's worth disputing, so I write a check and drop it in the mail. $63.05 Daily Total: $175.06",6,261
"5:30 a.m. — I set an early alarm to go to the gym – and actually go this time! I work through a power yoga class that was everything I needed. It's been so long since I've gone to yoga! Why did I stop? After class, I shower and change at the gym before I take the bus to work. $2.25 8:40 a.m. — Buy a cappuccino on my way into the office. $4.45 11:30 a.m. — I heat up leftover pasta for lunch, and realize that I still have a bunch of photos with my ex on my Facebook. I don't want to go through and delete them one by one and decide it's easier to just deactivate my account. 1 p.m. — I'm feeling much better today and decide to casually mention to a friend at work that my boyfriend and I broke up over the weekend. She is super supportive and reminds me this is my chance to meet up with a guy I had serious chemistry with a few months ago. She Facebook stalks him for me and learns that he is a CrossFit trainer who is fluent in a Romantic language and is very attractive. Unfortunately, he lives across the country, but I'm happily distracted thinking about how great it would be to take him up on his offer for drinks sometime. 6 p.m. — I leave work and catch the L home. I cook another HelloFresh recipe for dinner (veggie quesadillas) and watch more of . I still don't fancy Arie, but I'm starting to get into the drama between the ladies. $2.50 Daily Total: $9.20",7,261
"10 a.m. — I get to sleep in a little, though not as long as I would have liked. I drove home from a conference in New Haven, CT, last night in the middle of a snowstorm, so it took longer than expected. I was completely exhausted by the time I got home, and would have liked to spend all day lazing around today. Instead, I shower and head into the city on an 11:30 a.m. bus (using my monthly pass) to meet a friend for brunch before she heads back to her new home in Colorado. Because of my conference, I barely got to see her while she was here, so I don't mind making the trip into the city for such a short amount of time. We get bagels and another friend pays, because she's still chipping away at paying me back for a concert ticket I bought her about a month ago. After the bagel, we decide that we can call it even now. 3:30 p.m. — Back from the city. I stop by ShopRite on my way home to grab a few things for my mom – red and green grapes, salad greens, limes, and a small tub of vanilla ice cream. I throw in tampons for myself ($8.99). $25.67 7:30 p.m. — We squeeze in dinner after my mom gets back from tennis and before my dad leaves for hockey (my parents are honestly more active than I am). My grandparents are here (and staying overnight) and we're teaching my grandmother how to use her new iPhone. She's learning pretty quickly, but is having a hard time with the touch-screen keyboard. Dinner is sheet pan chicken and chickpeas, with chocolate chip banana bars and a scoop of ice cream for dessert. After dinner we do more iPhone tutoring until everyone starts to get a little testy and we call it a night. Daily Total: $25.67",1,262
"8:45 a.m. — I wake up for breakfast with the grandparents. No work today because it's a holiday. My measly salary is slightly offset by my great time-off package – we get 11 paid holidays, 15 days of paid vacation, four personal days, nine sick days, and three summer Fridays each year. Breakfast is bagels and lox (supplied by the grandparents), and I chat with my grandma about her feelings of stagnation in her old age. It's pretty depressing. 11:30 a.m. — Grandparents head out the door. I love them, but one night with them was plenty. I do a 40-minute YouTube yoga video and shower. Then I get started on my taxes – I'm filing for the first time. I get held up when my dad tells me he isn't sure whether or not he and my mom are claiming me as a dependent this year. I'm already in the financial zone, so I pay my credit card bill and my student loan, even though the payments aren't due for another week. I like to make the payments early in case any issues come up. 3 p.m. — Time for grocery shopping. The drive to Trader Joe's is only 15 minutes, but it always takes at least another 10 to find a parking spot. I stock up on food for the week, including salmon filets, baby bok choy, snow peas, sweet potatoes, coconut milk, Thai green curry simmer sauce, anchovies, goat's milk gouda, cilantro, a loaf of multigrain sourdough, half and half, a bunch of KIND bars, Cheddar Rockets, and peanut butter pretzels (work snacks are a necessity for me). My family likes to shop at different grocery stores for different items (TJ's produce is usually not ideal), and whoever is doing the shopping pays. $63.52 4 p.m. — I manage to sneak in an episode of before a friend of mine arrives for dinner. We make lemon caper cauliflower and fusilli and eat with my parents. Pack up leftovers for lunch tomorrow. After that, it's TV and wine for the rest of the night. I'm in bed by 12 for a quick FaceTime with my girlfriend, who is still in school in Ohio, and I'm asleep by 12:30. Daily Total: $63.52",2,262
"6:50 a.m. — I wake up to my alarm and hit the shower. Uncharacteristically, I remember to grab my bag of recently purchased work snacks (along with breakfast and lunch) before heading out the door to catch the 7:40 bus. I arrive at work at 9 (the commute is strangely smooth today), put my snacks in my snack drawer, make myself tea, and heat up oatmeal I brought from home. I eat breakfast while catching up on the news from the weekend. 1 p.m. — I catch up on emails and putting out small fires until lunchtime. While some of our clients are very self-sufficient, others are more needy and require assistance with every last detail of their cases. It's easy to get frustrated, but I remind myself that financial literacy is not a privilege that all people enjoy. For lunch, I eat leftover pasta and cauliflower from last night while reading up on the options for my next book club meeting. (I'm in a book club with a group of coworkers who are all great.) We all work at the same level in our organization, so our monthly meeting is also a nice time to catch up on and complain about work stuff. I decide that I'm voting in favor of by Octavia Butler. I love reading, but watching TV is just easier – so my book club is a great way for me to keep it balanced. 4 p.m. — Word is making its way around the office that there are extra sandwiches leftover from a fancy corporate lawyer meeting in one of the conference rooms. Being a nonprofit, we don't usually get free food. (In fact, our office doesn't even have a coffeemaker.) Work is slow and I'll be eating a light dinner tonight, so I swing by and pick up a turkey and cheese sandwich. During my snack break, I quickly order a pair of jeans I've been eyeing that just went on sale. I'll be able to pick them up in-store in New Jersey later this week. $41.30 5:45 p.m. — Clock out and make my way to the Met to meet my mom. A work friend invited her to a Lunar New Year celebration and she's bringing me along. There's tons of great Chinese food and an open bar, and we spend about an hour people-watching before heading back to NJ. I watch TV with my dad, have a quick FaceTime with the GF, and I'm asleep by 12:15. Daily Total: $41.30",3,262
"6:50 a.m. — Typical morning routine. I'm out the door by 7:35 to catch the bus. I arrive at work at 9:15 with latte and donut in hand. I'm trying to cut back on the amount of money I spend on coffee, but Gregory's always has deals on Wednesdays and I've been missing my morning chats with the baristas. Plus, my account hit the $50 mark, so I get a $5 credit for future purchases. Gotta love rewards programs. $7.36 1 p.m. — The morning flies by – quite unusual for me, but I'll take it. I manage to shake a client who seems like he'll never hang up the phone, and head to Bryant Park for lunch with my coworkers. As unbearable as midtown is in most regards, I love being able to spend my lunch break in the park, but I can't remember the last time it was warm enough. It's 75 degrees today – I almost feel like a real human again! Lunch is TJ's chicken tikka masala, which I'm trying for the first time. It isn't terrible, but also not great or particularly healthy. I promise myself I'll actually make lunch for the rest of the week. 3:30 p.m. — I leave the office for a long overdue performance review with my supervisor, who graciously buys iced tea for both of us before we head to the park (twice in one day!). I was really nervous for this because he's difficult to read, but it turns out he's been very happy with my work thus far! I've been working here for about seven months now with little feedback, so it's nice to have this affirmation. I also work up the courage to express that I feel capable of taking on more work, and he responds immediately by sending a few more cases my way. I'm back at my desk by 4:30 to finish up a few things, and out of the office a little after 5. 6:30 p.m. — After swinging by the pharmacy to pick up a few prescriptions, I get home to an empty house and get started on a 40-minute yoga flow. I usually like to vary my exercise between cardio at the gym, workouts from the Nike Training app, and yoga, but my knee has been hurting lately, so I'm trying to minimize impact. My parents still aren't home when I'm finished, which is typical for my mom but not so much my dad. He had a heart attack about a year ago and is doing much better now, but I still tend to panic whenever he's unaccounted for. A text confirms that he's just held up at the fish counter at Whole Foods, picking up salmon for dinner. When he gets home, I whip up a miso glaze for the fish, plus green beans sautéed with ginger and garlic and white rice. I've really tried to get on the brown rice train, but I just can't. (Actually, in all honesty, I haven't tried that hard.) There are leftovers, so I get away with not having to make lunch for another day. $6.08 11 p.m. — Restock on my face cleansers on Amazon. I started double cleansing about a year and a half ago, and I swear by it now. I finally close my eyes at 2:40 a.m., knowing tomorrow morning will be tough, but #noregrets! $38.08 Daily Total: $51.52",4,262
"6:50 a.m. — As predicted, waking up this morning is miserable. I'm planning on staying with friends in the city for the next two nights, so I stuff my clothes and makeup into my backpack and somehow manage to fit my running sneakers and a workout outfit too. I have grand fantasies of going to the gym before this week is over…we'll see if that pans out. I'm going to a Phoebe Bridgers concert with two friends tonight but I don't really know her music too well, so I listen to her top songs on Spotify on my commute. I also listen to the Sufjan Stevens songs from the soundtrack. Why do I do this? Starting off the day emosh, I guess. I'm at work by 9:25 (traffic is not great today), make myself tea, and munch on a KIND bar for breakfast. 12 p.m. — Early lunch today. I'm heading to a satellite office we have at a courthouse in Brooklyn to help translate for another one of our projects with a Spanish-speaking client, and I want to leave my desk by 1:30. I'm excited for the chance to get out, since I didn't make it to my project's weekly court clinic on Tuesday and I really like my coworkers at the satellite office. I heat up my leftover salmon and rice, do the crossword mini, and finish this week's episode of . If I believed in guilty pleasures, would be mine, but I don't! Why should I be guilty for liking what I like? 5:45 p.m. — I make it back to my office by 5 and finish up a few things before heading out to Williamsburg to meet my friends for dinner. We eat at Vanessa's, a cheap but reliable dumpling spot near the concert venue. One friend pays for dinner and the Uber to the venue (it's walking distance, but not in the cold and rain). Once we get there, I pick up the tab for drinks for all of us, and my other friend covers the coat check. We call it even to make our lives easier. $27 12:30 a.m. — Arrive back to my friend's apartment, where I'm crashing for the night (she pays for the $8 Uber home). The concert was amazing, and I  may have even liked the opener better than the main act! I go to sleep pretty much straight away, still reeling from staying up so late last night. Daily Total: $27",5,262
"8 a.m. — I get to sleep in this morning! Unfortunately, I wake up feeling horrible. I'm definitely not hungover, so I attribute it to a lack of sleep. I make it to the office by 9:45, eat a rice cake with peanut butter and honey, and start my work day. 4 p.m. — I decided to work through lunch today so I can leave the office early. I had plans with a friend to go to the gym together after work, but we both decide we'd rather be horizontal. I swing by Whole Foods to kill time while I wait for her to get off work and get something substantial to eat: rice, chana masala, and a samosa from the hot bar ($8.01). We decide on homemade pizza for dinner since she already has dough, so I grab a can of diced roasted tomatoes, a bag of shredded mozzarella, two bags of frozen broccoli, a toffee and sea salt chocolate bar, and raspberries ($21.70). $29.71 5:30 p.m. — After meeting on the train, my friend and I finally get home. We stop for a double bottle of wine en route, which she pays for. She makes me watch the pilot of , which I end up loving, so we watch another two episodes while making and eating dinner. We decide tonight is a night to be stationary drunk, and three other friends join us. We get to sleep around 1:30. Daily Total: $29.71",6,262
"11:30 a.m. — Roll out of bed after taking full advantage of the fact that it's Saturday. My friend and I go for a walk so we can get time outside before it starts to rain, and pick up a breakfast sandwich and a salad at a café to bring home and share. (She pays.) We make coffee and chat while we eat, and then watch a couple episodes of . After that we do a 35-minute yoga video together, and then take turns showering. I spend so much time at her apartment on the weekends, I should probably be paying her rent. 5:30 p.m. — We leave my friend's apartment to meet more people for dinner, and make it to the restaurant around 6:40. We grab drinks while we wait for a table, and I pay for two friends' drinks to make up for the Ubers on Thursday and breakfast from this morning. $29 9:30 p.m. — After dinner and a stop at another bar (where I don't get anything), I head to Port Authority (ew) to catch the bus home to Montclair (paid for with my monthly pass). I like to sleep in my own bed for at least one weekend night. I FaceTime with my GF for a while, trying to iron out dates for our trip to Spain this summer. We found a flight for under $500, so I want to buy tickets ASAP. We catch up on the mundane details of each other's' lives until we both get too sleepy. Daily Total: $29",7,262
"6:30 a.m. — My alarm goes off and I lay in bed looking at my phone for a bit. My 14-year-old Basset Hound is still snoring in his bed on the floor, so I'm safe to chill for a minute. 6:45 a.m. — Get up, get ready, do my makeup, and throw a good amount of dry shampoo in my hair. Happy Friday! 7:15 a.m. — I feed my animals (aforementioned Basset Hound and a grey cat). Plus I give the dog his medication ($76/month eye drops for his newly diagnosed diabetes insipidus). The medication really helps and he's as healthy as can be! 7:45 a.m. — I am running late this morning, so I can't give the old guy a walk. He makes a point to howl at me about how unacceptable this is. I give him a carrot for his troubles. I eat avocado toast, pack my to-go coffee, and head out to the light rail. 8:01 a.m. — Hop on the light rail, which is five minutes late. We get free public transit passes through my work. I take the light rail about three times per week. It's always entertaining. I listen to a true crime podcast on my ride. 8:49 a.m. — Get into my office and fill up my coffee mug for round two. Settle into work. 10:10 a.m. — My back is hurting, so I get up for a quick 10-minute walk. I have mildly terrible sciatica and I've spent a small fortune trying to “fix” it. Walking is really the only thing that helps. 12 p.m. — I am meeting a friend for lunch at a restaurant about a mile away, so I walk over. We chat, gossip, and eat our weight in Mexican food. She drives me back to my office. $10.50 2:33 p.m. — Jump on the light rail home. I'm going to finish the rest of the work day from the couch. 5:50 p.m. — I'm starting to get hungry even though my lunch was so big. Some friends are going to a brewery for dinner, but I don't feel like spending money or taking off my yoga pants. I'll meet them at their house later for board games and wine. I peruse my fridge for dinner. One of my New Year's goals was to not waste as much food, so I really try to be conscious of that. I give up and go walk the dog. 6:30 p.m. — Rejuvenated, I make a quesadilla, heat up leftover refried beans, and cut up half a cucumber and the rest of the raw broccoli I find in my fridge. Voila, dinner! 8 p.m. — Pack up the dog and head to my friend's house for wine and games. We play What Do You Meme?, I drink a couple of glasses of wine, and the dogs play. 10:45 p.m. — Somehow, my friend with benefits shows up. I'm the token single girl in my friend group of married and long-term couples. They want the FWB and I to be together; I know this is a bad idea because of 100 different reasons. But we all know he'll come home with me tonight. 11:30 p.m. — Pack up the dog and leave. FWB follows. Daily Total: $10.50",1,263
"7:30 a.m. — Up early for a Saturday! FWB tries to stay in bed but I have gotta go, homie. I feed the animals, get ready, and eat avocado toast and a protein bar. I hate protein bars, but they get the job done. I pack up my coffee and I'm out the door. 8:25 a.m. — I drop my car off at the mechanic. She needs an oil change and something is weird with the brakes. 8:40 a.m. — Scottsdale has a couple of bike share programs, so I download the app of the bike I see. The first day is free. I get on the bike and ride a mile to a local park. 9 a.m. — I am in a local charity game for the Young Professionals Board I'm on for a large nonprofit here in Phoenix. It's $10 for the entry fee and $10 for raffle tickets. $20 12:30 p.m. — Mechanic calls me and tells me I need my brake lines flushed. I also need a transmission flush apparently. I tell them to do the brakes and hold off of the transmission until I can talk to my dad. 1:30 p.m. — We got second place out of 10 teams! In the end, we lost to the teens. A local high school had a team and they really beat us good. I get another bike and ride back to the mechanic. 2 p.m. — The mechanic tells me all is well and I pay, get my keys, and go home to relax. $112.81 5 p.m. — I peel myself off the couch, shower, and get ready for dinner with my favorite married couple. They are my collective BFF. 6:30 p.m. — I head to Downtown Phoenix for dinner. There are apparently 100 events going on, so parking is terrible. I finally find a meter. It's ""freezing"" in Phoenix right now (50 degrees, lol) and I have to walk four blocks. $4 8 p.m. — For dinner we have amazing burgers and fries, I get a glass of wine, and the three of the us share a spiked milkshake for dessert. They ask me about FWB, and I explain again that he and I are in on the same page and both know that a relationship is not in the cards. $30 9:30 p.m. — Home and in bed. The cat is cuddly. I binge-watch and fall asleep. Daily Total: $166.81",2,263

I am so interested in the way they depict mental health, as I work in that field pretty regularly. 10:30 a.m. — It's my weekend for some specific chores, per our roommate agreement. I clean the shared bathroom, pick up dog poop, and throw in a load of laundry. Then, I eat half an avocado leftover from yesterday. 11:45 a.m. — Leave to meet my stepmom at the mall for shopping. She retired three years ago but is looking into a new part-time career and needs professional clothes. She hates shopping and I love it. It will be, put lightly, like pulling teeth. I'm determined not to buy anything for myself. 12 p.m. — Shop, shop, shop. Stepmom buys me some Marc Fisher polka dot mules and wooooo they are cute! 3 p.m. — We have lunch at The Yard; I have a roast beef sandwich, kale caesar salad, fries, and an extra-large glass of chardonnay. We talk politics and gun control, and I head home after lunch. I'm too sleepy to go to the grocery store. 6:30 p.m. — I clean up my room, fold laundry, and feed the animals. 8:30 p.m. — One of my favorite food bloggers does something called Fridge Foraging. So I pretend I'm her and look through my fridge for something I can make for dinner. I make pasta with frozen peas and sad spinach. I make a little pan sauce with butter, garlic, dried herbs, lemon juice and chicken broth. Top it off with parm. 9:15 p.m. — I get in the shower, do a face mask, and get in bed to watch more Daily Total: $0",3,263

I realize I am dangerously low on dog food and buy some on Amazon. $35.61 8 a.m. — The pup and I go for an extra-long walk. I will be driving a lot today and want to give my back as much reprieve as possible. Plus I want the dog to be tired out while I'm gone for the day. 8:30 a.m. — I make breakfast (two scrambled eggs and half of an avocado) and go over my day. I am spending the day in the field doing investigations, and I have to drive to the suburbs about 35 miles from my house. I get reimbursed $0.54/mile and usually get a $150-$250 mileage check each month, depending on my assignments. 9:15 a.m. — I pack up water and snacks and head out. I stop and get gas at some point. ($18.53 expensed) 12:10 p.m. — I stop at Chick-Fil-A for lunch. Terrible practices, delicious chicken nuggets. $7.33 3:30 p.m. — Finally done with my investigations, so I begin the 45-minute trek home. 4:25 p.m. — I stop at the grocery store and get baby spinach, a cucumber, celery, broccoli, a shallot, lemons, Dave's Killer Bread, Kaiser rolls, Frank's Buffalo Sauce, Farmer's cheese, Siggi's yogurt, chicken broth, ground turkey, and a bottle of wine. I then head home to relax a little bit. $37.04 5:15 p.m. — After lying in bed for 25 minutes, I get up and go for a 30-minute run and a 20-minute walk with the dog. 6:30 p.m. — I throw defrosted chicken in the oven with garlic salt and pepper. I clean the kitchen a bit and listen to a podcast while I wait. When the chicken is done, I shred it and add Frank's Buffalo Sauce before putting it back in the oven. In another dish, I cut up the head of broccoli and add lemon juice, olive oil, red pepper, and salt, and roast that off. I take a Kaiser roll and toast it. I open the bottle of wine because you can't watch with your roommate and not drink wine. 7:15 p.m. — I feed the dog, add non-sauced chicken to his food, and then assemble my dinner. The sandwich is to die for and I want another one, though I don't need it. I pack the other half of the chicken and broccoli for my lunch tomorrow. 9 p.m. — Two and a half glasses of wine and a whole episode of later, I text the FWB to come over. When he says he's on his way, I pull out two frozen cookie dough squares and put them in the oven. Sustenance. Daily Total: $79.98",4,263
"5 a.m. — FWB leaves to go to work (or to do whatever he needs to do). I let the dog out and the cat is screaming for breakfast. I end up going back to sleep. 7:15 a.m. — Up and at ‘em! I get ready, walk the dog, and eat two slices of toast with avocado. I find a half-wrinkly bell pepper in the fridge. The dog gets the wrinkly part as a treat, and I cut up the other half for a snack today. I also pack up my lunch, throw another Kaiser roll in a baggy, and pack my coffee to go. 8:22 a.m. — Hop on the light rail and turn on a podcast. 9:15 a.m. — Finally get to the office and settle in for work. I refill my coffee mug. 12:30 p.m. — I eat my lunch while talking to one of my volunteers. I then take a 30-minute lunchtime walk and stop at CVS to get peanut butter M&Ms as a treat. $0.88 2:45 p.m. — I jump on the light rail to finish my day at home. 5 p.m. — The work day is over and I fight through traffic to get to a friend's house. On Tuesdays, we host a podcast. There are four of us and it's always a fun time. I stop to get Cheetos on the way. $1.69 6:50 p.m. — The podcast goes well and it is now raining and freezing, sub 45 degrees, which is terrible weather for Arizona. I stop at the store to get egg noodles for dinner. $2.99 7:30 p.m. — I loosely follow The Pioneer Woman's Chicken and Noodles recipe and make cheesy garlic bread with the last Kaiser roll. Perfect for a cold night. 8:40 p.m. — I walk on the treadmill for 30 minutes and watch old reruns of while drinking water. 10:30 p.m. — Bedtime. I wash my face, use Sunday Riley Good Genes because my forehead is breaking out, and head to bed. I want to get up early and into the office at 8. Daily Total: $5.56",5,263
"7 a.m. — I did not get up early. I feed the animals, throw too much dry shampoo in my hair, and walk the dog. The rain has stopped, but it's still way too cold. 7:45 a.m. — I throw leftover soup, crackers, and a yogurt for breakfast in my bag. I still have the bell peppers in the fridge at work from yesterday and a protein bar in my bag. 8:10 a.m. — I hop on the light rail. 8:50 a.m. — In the office, I check my bank account. I see that my state tax return has FINALLY been deposited in my account. I pay off the outstanding balance of my credit card that has a plane ticket to Argentina on it. I was going to use my tax return ($1,600) to pay down my car loan, but alas, a plane ticket to Argentina sounded better. 10:05 a.m. — I eat my yogurt. I also realize I got 2% yogurt instead of the full fat and I am sad about it. I also take a handful of jelly beans from reception. 10:30 a.m. — I go for a 10-minute walk and when I get back, my boss in the office. He brought me a bottle of wine from his and his wife's pretty extensive wine collection. Perks, people. 11:52 a.m. — My back is angry today, so I do sacroilliac joint stretches while I'm at my desk eating those bell pepper slices. 12:30 p.m. — I eat my soup and crackers and then go on a 30-minute walk. I also sign myself up for a 4:30 class with ClassPass, since my credits just re-set today. 2:45 p.m. — I get on the light rail to finish my day at home. A volunteer calls while I am on the train with an urgent issue and I walk her through next steps. 3:30 p.m. — I answer emails and write a report until it's time to get ready. I get dressed and make a pre-workout drink for my drive over. My brother recommended that I do this when I take this specific circuit class and lift weights (which is rare!), and it really makes a difference in my workouts. 4:30 p.m. — Circuit class time! It's honestly the hardest class I have done here. 12 workouts equal one circuit, and we have 12 minutes to do as many circuits as possible. Then we rest for one minute and repeat the whole routine two more times! I finish feeling great! 5:45 p.m. — I get home, walk the dog, and chat with my neighbors for a bit. They are watching the dog for three days while I'm in Argentina, since my roommate can't. 7 p.m. — For dinner, I make ground turkey tacos with refried beans, shredded cheese, green onions, and tomatoes. This is one of my favorite meals, and I make it usually once a week. I season the turkey with a ton of spices and assemble my tacos. 8:10 p.m. — I clean the kitchen and pack my lunch for tomorrow. I'm out of tortillas, so I put the turkey over a bunch of spinach with shredded cheddar and green onions. I also cut up half a cucumber for a snack. 8:30 p.m. — My roommate gets home and we open the bottle of wine my boss gave me. It's a tart white and not quite right for a 45 degree night, but we survive and drink it. It's usually a high of 80 degrees this time of year, but the last two weeks it's been a high of 60, which, in Arizona, is unfortunate. 9:30 p.m. — Shower and face mask. FWB texts me the equivalent of “u up?” and I tell him I am, but not up for company. 10:30 p.m. — Bed. Daily Total: $0",6,263
"7:05 a.m. — Up! I get ready, curl my hair, and notice I am almost out of my new favorite serum, Caudalie Vinoperfect Radiance Serum. I got a decent sample size of it and used it every morning for a month and wow — it makes a difference. I look it up on Sephora, but can't justify spending $79 for it at the moment. Sad. 7:35 a.m. — Walk the dog, pack my lunch and a yogurt for breakfast, and leave for the light rail. 8:15 a.m. — Public transit here is subpar at best, and the closest light rail parking garage is four miles from my house, which is about a 10-minute drive for me. I get on the 8:25 train. 9 a.m. — I get into work and make a to-do list. I have a training class from 1-4 p.m., and I have more on my to-do list than I expected. I settle in to work after filling up my coffee mug again. I eat my yogurt. I also gossip with my officemates about some policy changes in the court that we're happy about, as well as many others we're angry about. 10:18 a.m. — I realize it's the first of the month and my roommates have sent me the money for our bills. I am a self-realized controlling person, so I take care of the bills for the household. I pay our rent, pool service, and Internet bill. 11:50 a.m. — I have an early lunch before my class. I hope this training has snacks, because while salad is great, ya girl needs some chocolate to get through these three hours. 4:50 p.m. — Finally, I get on the train to go home. It was a long day of talking to people. 5:45 p.m. — I get home and change and take the pup to the dog park. There's a little library by the park and I have a book to return and two to donate. 7 p.m. — On the way home, I order a medium pizza with sausage and jalapeño! I'm over cooking for this week, and I've eaten all my leftovers. $12.98 7:30 p.m. — I stuff my face with pizza and watch Hulu. My back is hurting from sitting a ton today, so I schedule a chiropractor appointment for tomorrow and do about 30 minutes of stretching. 8:30 p.m. — I browse the Lululemon sale section online and find nothing (which is lucky for my budget). I start getting ready for bed and winding down for the night. 10:45 p.m. — Bedtime. Daily Total: $12.98",7,263
"8:30 a.m. — I wake up at 7:15 a.m. after snoozing my alarm twice. I debate whether I really need to shower, because it's so cold outside. I grew up in Bangladesh and struggle with New York weather. I'm marrying a New Yorker, though, so I have to get used to it! I decide to be an adult and shower and get dressed. I have learned that if I look good, I feel energetic. I walk quickly to the train ($2.75). Once I make my transfers and get on the G, I sit down and do my makeup (yes, I am one of those people). I put on the same makeup every day, and it takes me four minutes to do it. I get off the subway and pick up coffee ($2) from the corner diner. (It's this mom and pop diner run by an old Greek curmudgeon who yells at everyone and only accepts cash. I go there every weekday morning for my coffee). $4.75 10 a.m. — I work in a school building where my fiancé, R., is a teacher. (I know, eye roll – meet cute to the max – I can't stand us either.) He has a coffeemaker in his classroom, so I always go up to visit him for my second cup of coffee. I can't live without that first cup from the Greek diner – R. has tried to have this debate with me many times. I make my coffee, wave to R. (he's teaching), and go downstairs to start my work day. I have a list of items to do today that I put off last Friday. 11:15 a.m. — Because I don't eat breakfast, I am usually ravenous by 11:15. Today I brought a baked chicken breast with pesto and lime and stir-fried sugar snap peas with halved cherry tomatoes. It's very easy to make pesto at home, and so much more flavorful – just throw in a couple of cloves of garlic, a bunch of basil leaves, olive oil, salt, and pepper into a food processor and blitz it. I packed R. two chicken breasts, a couple of slices of tomato, baby spinach, and baby carrots for lunch. (I am in the process of turning a carnivorous man into an omnivorous man.) 5:30 p.m. — R. and I come home from work. (He drives and I ride home with him, which is why I don't buy a monthly Metrocard.) R. changes, pours me a glass of wine, and then goes off for his afternoon time on the couch while I start prepping dinner. We usually roast meat on Sundays (yesterday we roasted a whole chicken) and use the meat for lunches/dinners throughout the week. Tonight is chicken tacos. I chop up tomatoes, cilantro, red onions, and a jalapeño. Then I boil corn, cut off the kernels, and add them to the salsa with a squeeze of lime. Next, I shred cooked chicken thighs and toss with cumin, chili powder, oregano, onion, and garlic. R. and I sit and chat for a while before heading off to the gym. 9 p.m. — R. and I walk home after our workout class and pick up a bottle of wine on the way. Then R. warms up the tortillas and we eat our tacos while drinking wine in front of the TV. Bedtime at 10:30. $9.99 Daily Total: $14.74",1,264
"8:30 a.m. — It's Tuesday and I am not interested. R. wakes up and leaves for work an hour before me. I grunt and roll out of bed, shower, do makeup on the G train ($2.75), and am at my Greek diner by 8:25. I tell Old Man Curmudgeon he should have an XL-sized coffee cup offering. He says: ""Never."" I think he thought I was giving him bad business advice. It all got lost in our shared second language. $4.75 10 a.m. — Busy morning doing things nobody cares enough about. I go up to R.'s room to get my second cup of coffee. He's having a rough morning, so I listen to him vent for a few minutes and we both talk about how much we want to go home. 11:15 a.m. — Lunch. Read a Modern Love story on the website and eat leftover taco chicken and salsa. (R. got the last of pesto baked chicken from Sunday for his lunch.) I start to get hungry again at 2 p.m., so I walk over to the office cookie jar and get a chocolate chip cookie. 6 p.m. — Prep dinner at home while R. is on the couch. I throw a pork chop in the oven for R. to take for his sandwich tomorrow and struggle to tear off all the meat left on the chicken carcass from Sunday. It's a royal pain the butt. Why isn't there some kitchen gadget to do this? I throw the carcass in a Ziploc and stash it in the freezer to make chicken stock this weekend. I cook rice on the stove and chop celery, carrots, cherry tomatoes, and sugar snap peas. Then I call out to R. to get my gym bag together, and we head off to gym. 9:30 p.m. — Splurge on a more expensive bottle of wine on the way home from gym. Make chicken fried rice. Lights out at 10:30. I try to stay up and read P.G. Wodehouse after R. falls asleep, but my body has shut down. $11.99 Daily Total: $16.74",2,264
"8:30 a.m. — Take the subway ($2.75) and get my usual coffee ($2), which is too bitter this morning. At my desk at work, I write on R.'s Facebook page about how we are basically Prince Harry and Meghan Markle. (Aside from also being interracial, there are other similarities between us, like our timelines of engagement and impending wedding.) $4.75 11:15 a.m. — R. and I decide to take a walk to the corner deli, since it's cold but sunny out. We buy a couple of seltzer water cans, chips for me to snack on later, and R.'s roll for his pork chop sandwich. R. pays the $3.75 with his credit card. I have $2 with me and I try to give it to him, but he says I should keep it so he doesn't have to settle my coffee debt later. (Sometimes when I have no cash, I get Old Man Curmudgeon to give me my morning coffee on a loan and then have R. pay him back the next morning.) Back at my desk, I have leftover chicken fried rice with salsa and seltzer water and read a short story on website. 2 p.m. —Sephora emails me a discount code and I place an order for skincare products. Sometimes I wait too long to reorder my items because I want a code, and then I run out of them and create panic situations. (One time, I sent a clueless R. to Sephora for face moisturizer the day before Christmas Eve when every woman in New York was at Sephora.) I buy my facial sunscreen, face wash, cleansing and exfoliating wipes (so great for a lazy nighttime person like me), and decide to try Kat Von D's tattoo liner. How did women get suckered into spending literally thousands of hard-earned dollars on makeup and skincare? Two generations ago this would be unthinkable. $92.01 5:30 p.m. — At home, I drink a glass of wine while making gemelli with spicy Italian sausage, spinach, and cherry tomatoes. R. found this recipe in and it's one of our go-tos for weekday dinners and summertime picnic lunches. Incredibly easy and delicious. I cook the sausage in simmering olive oil with onions and red chili flakes. I chop up the spinach and quarter the cherry tomatoes, which I keep in a bowl to toss with the sausage when we come back from the gym. I also throw another pork chop in the oven for R.'s lunch tomorrow. Hang out with R. on the couch, and then it's gym time! 10:30 p.m. — I read P.G. Wodehouse and turn off the lights. R. is already lightly snoring. I shift him around until he stops and then fall asleep thinking of our wedding in June. Must browse online for wedding bands. Daily Total: $96.76",3,264
"8 a.m. — I wake up with brain fog and a desire to not move. I have thyroid issues, and even though my doctor checks my TSH levels annually and says I don't need medication yet, there are certain days when I feel like a straight-up old man swimming through soup. I decide to skip the shower and dress in my gym clothes, which will give me more time later for dinner prep. I also decide to skip the subway today and take an Uber Pool to work. $11.98 8:35 a.m. — Coffee. Desk. Let this day begin. $2 11:30 a.m. — Everything has snowballed into a giant mess at work. R. is having an equally frustrating day. I finally eat my lunch (leftover gemelli), all the while feeling like a hamster on a wheel. 2 p.m. — Time for a trip to the cookie jar! 4 p.m. — Done with work-related things today. I need to get shampoo, conditioner, body lotion, and R.'s hair styling cream (without it he is lost). I decide to place an order from Target online for pick up, and then head over to the one a few blocks away to get my order before going home. $30.30 5:30 p.m. — R. is a bad influence. He has talked me out of going to the gym since we went Monday (which is usually our no-gym, pro-laundry day) and instead into going to the neighborhood bar across the street from our apartment. We have one drink each. R. pays with his credit card ($22 with tip) and we head back to the apartment. Thursday night is our weekly dinner with my cousin who lives in the neighborhood. We have meatballs (from the leftover sausage meat) with gravy and a kitchen sink salad. My cousin walks in with a bottle of wine as I am preparing the gravy (pork stock from the last time we made pork roast, flour, salt, pepper, garlic, and onion powder). While we eat, we talk about our weeks and open two bottles of wine. 11:30 p.m. — Woof. Bed. Daily Total: $44.28",4,264
"7:30 a.m. — I wake up and want to die. I think about Bukowski and how he said ""you do it because you have done it before"" or something to that effect, and peel myself out of the bed. Uber Pool to work. Can't even think about it. $8.98 10 a.m. — I skip my morning coffee today, but by 10 o'clock I need caffeine. I slowly get myself up to R.'s room. He is talking to one of his students, and his face looks as devastated as I feel. I pour myself some coffee and head down to stare at Excel sheets. 11 a.m. — Apparently, I packed lunch for us last night. There are leftover meatballs and gravy on salad for me and meatballs on a sub for R. Eat slowly while drinking my fourth bottle of water. The water is like an IV drip for me. 4:30 p.m. — The work day is over. This is a miracle. Teachers are heading over for their Friday happy hour at the bar across the street, and R. and I head over. After two drinks, chicken wings, and fried pickles, we say goodbye to everyone and head home on the subway. R. pays for the food and drinks as well as both of our subway rides. 7:30 p.m. — We cuddle on the couch and drink more wine. We talk about the wedding in June and iron out some details. Most of everything is done. The total spending will be around $3,000.  The plan is to put everything on a credit card and then pay it off quickly. We're in bed by 9:15. Daily Total: $8.98",5,264
"8:15 a.m. — R. and I wake up without the alarm and walk around the apartment in our PJs. I make the bed, he waters all the plants and makes coffee, and then we turn on music and have a morning chat about world news. After an hour of this, I call my parents in Bangladesh and R. goes to make his breakfast of scrambled eggs and toast. 12 p.m. — I make tea, eat nuts, soppressata, and cheese, and start working on my novel. I finished the first draft almost two years ago (took me two years to write it), way before I met R., and have only recently started editing it. R. is on the couch watching a design and architecture documentary on Netflix that he wants to show his students. 2 p.m. — R. and I watch a movie and drink white wine from the fridge. After the movie ends, we sit down to do our meal planning for next week. R. jots down the grocery list. (We typically go to the supermarket every Sunday and do a big haul.) 5 p.m. — I shower and get ready to head out to a friend's place in Brooklyn for a group dinner. We have these three or four times a month. I throw the last of my cucumbers, tomatoes, red onion, and spinach from the vegetable drawer in a tote bag to make a salad once we get there. While R. is in the shower, I step out to buy a bottle of wine to bring too. Our friend who lives in the same neighborhood as us is driving to Brooklyn, so he picks us up and then we're on our way! $9.99 7 p.m. — Happily drinking away and playing with friend's baby. 10:30 p.m. — We're full from dinner and wine and getting sleepy. R. and I hitch a ride back to our neighborhood with the friend who's driving back. Once home, we watch a little TV and go to bed. It was a good day. Daily Total: $9.99",6,264
"8:45 a.m. — We wake up lazily and make coffee. Sunday is our brunch and grocery day. R. makes eggs and bacon while I make home fries. We pour ourselves two mimosas (cranberry instead of orange juice) and set the table for brunch. 11:30 a.m. — After we eat, R. cleans up in the kitchen while I shower and get ready. I make a short call to my friend in Bangladesh to catch her up on our June wedding details while R. is in the shower. And then we're off to get the day started. First stop, neighborhood bar where we chat with our bartender friend, each have a giant mimosa, review our meal plans, and finalize grocery list (there are always more items to add when we look at it a second time). Our friend says he can't stand how domestic we are and gives us another round of mimosas for free. The bill is $22 with tip, which I cover. $22 2 p.m. — We finish grocery shopping after what feels like a year and walk back home with approximately fifty bags each. R. uses his credit card to pay but I pay him back we get home. Once home, we put on music and start meal prep for next week. We also start stock on the Crock-Pot with the chicken carcass from last week. (Most of the time, instead of using just oil, I use oil and homemade stock to cook food.) $110 8 p.m. — The day flies by! I am tired but feel accomplished. After the kitchen is cleaned up and lunches are packed for tomorrow, we sit down on the couch with wine and watch . Bed at 9:45 p.m. Daily Total: $132",7,264
"8 a.m. — I wake up and get ready for work. This week is a weird one, as I just started my new job last week. My company is the food and beverage provider for a few major sports teams, and today is my first game day! I get ready and head downstairs to make my coffee, and see that it is snowing AGAIN. I have lived in Oregon for a month and a half, and we've already had four snow days! Coming from California, that's a big deal. I chug my coffee and head to the car, correctly predicting that my commute will be worse than usual. 10:05 a.m. — I get to work a little late, which is impressive considering the amount of traffic there was on the freeway. Because today is a game day, I have to park further away. After walking in the wrong direction, I finally make it to the employee entrance. I make it into my temporary office and begin processing all of the new hires that came to our orientation yesterday. 12 p.m. — Lunchtime! There are so many perks about my job (seriously, I have not stopped talking about how amazing my job is since I started), but one of my favorites is that while I'm at this location, I get free food! The culinary team is great and makes food for all our employees, and I load up my plate with a burrito, potatoes, corn salad, and braised chicken. Inputting new hire information is a lot more fun when free food is involved! 3:30 p.m. — It's finally time for the employees to come check in and get their assignments for the game, and I'm so excited! We finish with just enough time for me to run back into my office and grab my stuff for the game. My boyfriend got free tickets from a friend, and my boss is setting us up with a free meal. Needless to say, I'm pretty psyched. 5:45 p.m. — Dinnertime! My boyfriend brings his friend, and we all enjoy amazing food and great drinks from a local brewery. We tip $20, partly because my company paid for the rest of the meal, and partly because I know these servers rely on great tips from their customers! My boyfriend pays. 10 p.m. — Finally home! The game was great, and the drive home was better than expected. The employee parking lot isn't super convenient to get to, but it sure makes avoiding post-game traffic easy. I go through my nighttime routine of cleansing with micellar water and putting on moisturizer. I recently got really into my skincare, but my routine is pretty low-key and basic. Daily Total: $0",1,265
"9 a.m. — Another exciting day! It's our first hiring event for our new location, and my first hiring event with this company! I'm heading to my main office to pick up supplies and my administrative assistant. I stop for gas on the way and fill up my tank so I'm not stranded in Portland with no gas. I intend to run into Starbucks and grab drinks and breakfast for the both of us, but in the stress of loading up my tiny car in the rain, I forget. Oh well, tomorrow's a brand new day! $19.76 11 a.m. — We make it to the university where we're hosting our hiring event. We'd normally hold it in our offices, but they are under construction, and we don't have space to hold that many people at the moment. We set up much quicker than anticipated, and enjoy chatting with our HR team from the other office. 12 p.m. — Lunchtime! My boss runs out to grab everyone lunches from a cafe nearby. My rice bowl with avocado, cheese, olives, tomatoes, and sour cream isn't the most satisfying, but it does hold me over through the event! 7 p.m. — Finally home for five minutes. Tonight my boyfriend and I are attending the last of the six-week communication course we have been taking at our local Chabad house. I have just enough time before the class to run home to grab a package my mom sent. I open it and am so excited to find all sorts of goodies from California! On Purim, one of the things people do is give baskets or bags of goodies to people, and I'm so happy to have this special gift on my first real Purim away from home. We quickly head over to the rabbi's, where we attend our class (he does a special reading for the two of us) and eat homemade hamentaschen. Purim is one of my favorite Jewish holidays. We celebrate Queen Esther, who stood up to the King on behalf of the Jewish people and saved the Jews from Haman (boo!), who had plotted to kill all the Jews because he had major ego issues. 9:45 p.m. — On our way back from the rabbi's, I remember that I haven't eaten real food since noon, and have a sudden craving for a sandwich. My boyfriend drives me to Jimmy John's, where I get a turkey sandwich ($8) and a drink for my boyfriend ($2) as payment for going out of the way to feed me. We head home and go to bed. $10 Daily Total: $29.76",2,265
"6 a.m. — Ugh... I hate being up this early. I jump in the shower, do my morning skincare routine (Glossier Milky Jelly Cleanser in the shower and then Glossier Solution and Priming Moisturizer). Since I started using the Solution about a month ago, I have noticed such a big difference in the my overall skin. I drink a coffee while scrolling through social media before I have to head out. This is my first day going in at my new time, and I'm pleasantly surprised when my GPS is wrong and I get in 15 minutes earlier than expected. 12:30 p.m. — I am starving after not eating any breakfast, but manage to make it until my admin assistant's lunch break so we can head over to Fred Meyer together. I recently discovered this behemoth of a grocery store, and I am OBSESSED. I grab really good sushi from the sushi bar and a little triangle of brie (the best grocery store combo I've ever purchased). I get crackers once I'm back in the office, and eat while reading over the bunch of emails that came in while I was out. $13.79 3:30 p.m. — And I'm off! After a fun hour of rearranging office furniture, I sneak out early to head to a Purim party. I accidentally leave my admin assistant's keys on my desk. (I am using hers while mine are being made, because I come in so much earlier than her.) I'll have to come in later tomorrow so that someone else can let me in, which bums me out because I was so excited to stick to an early schedule. Oh well. I make it home just in time for the party, where I eat great food and hang out with great people, most of them under the age of five. (I'm a sucker for kids, especially when I don't know many other people at the party!) Daily Total: $13.79",3,265
"7:45 a.m. — Up and on my way to work! I'd usually be in by now, but I forgot the keys to my office, and the guy who can let me in doesn't usually get in until 9. I fill up my car for what feels like the millionth time this week, and head on up to Portland! $18.67 9:45 a.m. — My admin assistant and our controller are here, and we're switching desks around so that I can finally have an office! We finish just in time for my first area HR call with our regional director. I successfully sound like a responsible professional while sitting in a broken chair surrounded by computer boxes. Then it's back to work setting up my office and getting stuff done. Except I decide I absolutely need to order a three-pack of Glossier's Balm Dotcom. I love the flavor I already have. Now I'll have one in my office, one in my car, and two in my bag! I choose Birthday, Mint, and Cherry for my trio, and pray that they ship soon so that my fingers and lips stop peeling from the cold! $30 11:45 a.m. — I'm way too hungry to get any more work done, and venture out into the cold to try a food truck outside my office. It's a Korean fusion truck that everyone raves about, and I get a beef bulgogi rice bowl. I'm a little disappointed, but then again, my food standards are pretty high after growing up in the Bay Area. $9.78 4 p.m. — It's the weekend! I head out after running around like a crazy person trying to make sure everything that needed to get done before Monday has been done, and make an attempt to leave before the Friday traffic gets too bad. I make it back and have about 45 minutes before my boyfriend and I have to head to Shabbat dinner. I crawl right into bed and lie down for as long as humanly possible before putting my shoes back on and heading out the door. 10:30 p.m. — My boyfriend and I try to go to Shabbat dinner every Friday at the rabbi's house, and this will be the last one for a couple weeks because the rabbi is going to Israel! We're all very excited about the group going, and dinner is so much fun. We eat tons of delicious food, and I spend the second half of dinner playing with their two-year-old. We head out fairly early for us, and watch Netflix in bed until we fall asleep. Daily Total: $58.45",4,265
"9:45 a.m. — I had planned for a relaxing weekend because I've had such a busy week, but end up having to take my car in for repairs. My car is 11 years old, and is requiring much more maintenance than I expected. I get to the dealer, where they promptly tell me that someone must have hit my car and driven off. I leave with instructions to call a body shop on Monday and a warning to call a tow truck if any fluid leaks out. I proceed to freak out and refuse to drive my car for the rest of the day, even though I've driven to Portland and back for three days since I noticed the part and clearly have survived. 11:45 a.m. — My boyfriend decides to be productive and take us to Safeway so I can pick up coffee pods for my office. I get frustrated with the selection (why spend $10 on 10 capsules when I can go to Costco and spend $25 on 60?!). We pick up a butternut squash and bread so I can roast the veggies we already have in the fridge and round the mixture out with something new. (My boyfriend pays.) We also stop at a Russian store so my boyfriend can pick up a cake for an International Student Dinner we have tonight. (Boyfriend pays.) Then we head to Costco, and I somehow manage to go through all the aisles and only stop for a few samples. I grab coffee pods, a peanut butter trail mix we're obsessed with, and Tillamook snacking cheese ($53.57). While I pay, my boyfriend gets us two hot dogs. Score! $53.57 4:30 p.m. — I spend way too much time prepping the vegetables I'm trying to roast, but the end result is totally worth it — there is nothing better than vegetables roasted slowly with olive oil and garlic. 6 p.m. — We get to the dinner, even though I have last minute thoughts about going. I love my boyfriend's postgrad program, but deep down, I'm an introvert who hates meeting new people. In the end, I'm glad I went – it's really cool that the school puts on this potluck dinner every year to celebrate the different countries their students come from. Everyone brought a dish (or dishes) from their home country or culture. We eat until it is physically impossible to eat any more, and somehow get coerced into going out and getting drinks afterwards. 9 p.m. — The only reason I agreed to go out is because we're going to go to this bar that makes the BEST gin and tonic I have ever had. The bar is packed, so we head over to another cool bar that has really good drinks. I'm still hopeful, and order a gin and tonic while my boyfriend orders a Moscow Mule. I end up being seriously disappointed and also way too full to drink my drink quickly. My boyfriend teaches me how to play shuffleboard in the meantime, and I (surprisingly) don't suck! I make it until 10:30, when the mediocre alcohol hits me, and I start to get sleepy. We get home and dream of having a relaxing Sunday. $16 Daily Total: $69.57",5,265
"10 a.m. — Off to the gym! I don't have a membership, but I do use my boyfriend's student card to get me in to his campus gym (shh, don't tell anyone). I do 45 minutes on the bike and 15 minutes on the adaptive motion trainer, too. I'm really trying to get in the habit of working out five days a week. The biggest struggle is just motivating myself to get there. After the gym, I put on a face mask (Pores Be Pure Mud Mask from Formula 10.0.6 – I own almost all of their masks, and I'm obsessed) and jump in the shower. 11:45 a.m. — I head to Target to grab more micellar water, a ladle, a Harry's razor and shaving cream for my boyfriend, and a small set of Tupperware ($39.30). I've been bugging my boyfriend for months to try using Harry's. Last night, in his sleep, he told me he wanted it, so I figure it's finally time to bite the bullet and buy the thing. As soon as I get in the car, my boyfriend calls me and tells me his phone broke. I head across the street to Best Buy and buy him a phone case using a gift card of his that I've been holding on to. ($30 on gift card, $9.99 on my card. He'll pay me back.) Then, it's off to Trader Joe's! I grab milk, cauliflower, chickpeas, lemons, cherry tomatoes, greens, cooked chicken breasts, tahini, pasta, onions, and ground beef ($48.79). I'm trying new recipes this week, and I hope that they work out! $98.08 6:30 p.m. — I start making dinner (ground beef bulgogi over rice), and halfway through, my boyfriend asks if he can invite our friend for dinner. Normally I'd be super excited, but I was planning on getting two days of lunches out of the leftovers! I say ""of course,"" because I'm not coldhearted, and we enjoy the dinner and company. I get my boyfriend to try these ginger chews that my mom sent. They're terrible, but we all laugh and enjoy it anyways. I even have enough leftovers for one day of lunch! Daily Total: $98.08",6,265
"6 a.m. — Up and off to work! This is the first time in a long time that I didn't have the Sunday scaries before heading to work. I get into the office early and get to work on super fun training videos. I can't tell if time moves faster or slower with these videos, but sooner or later I get caught up and am almost late for a webinar! 2 p.m. — I finally get a call from the auto body shop, and they tell me to stop in when they open tomorrow morning. They should be able to take a look and get me a quote quickly. I let our Director of Operations know that I'll be in late, and start planning for tomorrow. 5:15 p.m. — Home and hungry! Boyfriend has class until 9, so I make dinner for myself and leave some for him. Lately I've been waiting for him, but today was long and I'm starving. I make a quick spicy udon stir fry using frozen udon noodles I bought last time I went to the big Asian market near Portland. It's delicious, and I sit on the couch rewatching and decompressing while eating. 9:30 p.m. — Boyfriend gets home and our neighbor comes over to watch . I'm too tired, but he convinces me to stay up and watch with them. We make it halfway through the episode and then our Chromecast decides that we need to watch the beginning over and over and over again. We call it a night. Nothing is better than crawling into my nice warm bed when it's in the 30s outside! Daily Total: $0",7,265
"6:15 a.m. — My alarm goes off so I get up, feed my dog and my cat, stretch for a few minutes, and get ready for work. Getting ready involves splashing my face with warm water, applying rosehip oil, and putting on a full face of makeup every workday. I love doing my makeup – it gives me some ""me"" time in the morning where I can listen to podcasts. I clean the cat's litter box before making coffee, packing up my breakfast and lunch, and heading out the door. 7:45 a.m. — I eat instant oatmeal at my desk and catch up on work. Since it's payday, I pay my student loan bill and transfer money to my various savings accounts. I took out very minimal loans in undergrad because I had a full Bright Futures scholarship, and then minimal loans in graduate school due to a research assistantship that nearly paid my full tuition. As soon as I got my full-time job, I made it a priority to pay off my loans as quickly as possible and get on with my life! I have been making about three times the minimum payment on my student loan bill for the past year, and at this rate it will be paid off in another year! So happy. 9:45 a.m. — I have been wanting MoviePass for a while, and it's having a great special right now for the entire year. My brother and my boyfriend are getting it too, so I anticipate a lot of ""free"" movies in our future! My brother and I are obsessed with horror movies and want to see all the ones that come out in theaters this year. $105.35 11 a.m. — I pop a bag of popcorn and snack on it. It's a little burnt, but I'm weirdly into it. I'm a big snacker. 12 p.m. — Time for lunch! I have leftover rice and beans that definitely need more salt. I almost always use my lunch breaks to read. I preordered Michelle McNamara's book about a month ago, and it arrived yesterday! I settle in to read and eat. 2 p.m. — My car has been yelling at me that ""oil maintenance is required soon,"" so I hop over to the mechanic shop, which is close to work. The guys who work there are super nice. (And VERY hot! Like all of them. Is it a prerequisite for working there?) While I wait for them to finish, I read more of . I take a break to scroll Facebook and see in one of my local dog groups that someone is looking to trade a medium-sized dog crate for a large dog crate. When I adopted my dog last year, I didn't know what I was doing, and got her an extra-large crate. (She's 50 pounds.) I message the guy and he gets right back to me. We arrange to meet and trade the next day. $57.99 3 p.m. — Finally back in the office, but it's a slow day. I eat two Halo mandarins and read Money Diaries. Before I leave work, I check my personal email and see I got an email from my volunteer coordinator at the local animal shelter, where I volunteer about once a week. She emailed to let me know one of my favorite pups, who had been with us for over six months, was adopted by a nice family with kids (and he loves kids!). Happy tears!!! 4:30 p.m. — I leave work and head to Costco. My boyfriend just got us a membership and it's the tits. I like to go once a month to get some staples and one or two snacks; my boyfriend and I eat pretty differently so we mostly buy food separately. This time I pick up sweet potatoes, organic bananas, six boxes of a sweet potato-tomato soup we both like, pasta, a huge jug of peanut butter pretzels (my kryptonite), organic peanut butter, frozen mango, and frozen broccoli. My boyfriend doesn't like peanut butter, but my dog and I do! $81.66 4:30 p.m. — I also pick up a jug of laundry detergent and a 36-pack of Fancy Feast for my fancy little panther. $29.28 5:15 p.m. — On my way out of Costco, I stop to fill up my car with gas. Since I drive a Prius and only work about three miles from home, I generally only have to fill up my tank once a month, which is awesome. On the way home, I cry a little more thinking about the adopted dog. I am so happy for him, but wish I had gotten a chance to say goodbye. $20.28 6:15 p.m. — I'm finally home! I kiss all my babies hello and unpack the groceries. I rearrange and clean the refrigerator and pantry, which is a weird thing I love to do every few weeks. It's so freakin' satisfying to have an organized fridge and pantry. I clean up a bit and do dishes. 7 p.m. — Finally time to start dinner! Every Wednesday my friend comes over for dinner and we watch a true crime-ish show while debating with my boyfriend. (He's a lawyer. We're not, but we like to pretend we know things). We've watched maybe seven shows together so far, and this week we are starting a new one: It's my week to make dinner, so I make pasta and broccoli with spicy peanut butter sauce, which is my specialty and my friend's favorite meal of mine. My BF, the peanut butter-hater, makes a separate meal. We sit down to pasta, wine, and the . 10 p.m. — My friend leaves, and I indulge in Girl Scout cookies that my BF got us. (Apparently I'm ""basic"" for liking Thin Mints. Uh ok, Mr. Shortbread Cookie.) Then I wash my face, apply rosehip oil, brush my teeth, and hit the hay. Daily Total: $294.56",1,266
"6:30 a.m. — I'm awake! I get ready while catching up on the minisodes from . Before I leave, I clean the cat's litter box and remind him to be a good boy. He never is but I love him anyway. I make a mango, banana, orange, chia, and coconut milk smoothie and coffee with coconut milk and pack it all up for work. 7:45 a.m. — I get to work and see my BF has Venmoed me his portion of the rent. After I transfer the amount to my bank account, I pay our rent. Then I start brainstorming for a new project I was assigned. 10 a.m. — I have the entire soundtrack stuck in my head and pause work to snack on peanut butter pretzels. My BF texts about a possible trip to Salt Lake City around my birthday. He's going for work, so we have a free place to stay, and all I would have to buy is the plane ticket. Yes, please. 12 p.m. — I get out of a meeting and am ready for lunch. I have leftover peanut butter pasta and work through lunch because I want to use my lunch break to run errands. 1 p.m. — I quickly head over to Petco for pet supplies. I have a membership card there and the rewards and perks are great. Today my dog's wet food is buy one can, get the other half off. I grab about a million of those and two bags of cat litter, which is also on sale. $41.36 1:45 p.m. — Settle in for an afternoon of research to the dulcet tunes of Britney Spears. 3:30 p.m. — Pause for a chilled apple and another handful of pretzels. They're just so goooood. 4:30 p.m. — I head home. When I get there, I find my BF has already walked the dog. I pout a little because I usually get to walk her after work every day and I enjoy it! I strap her leash back on for a short run so we can get out together. My dog was heartworm positive when I adopted her about a year ago and still hasn't been cleared by our vet. I put her on slow kill treatment right when I got her, and now I get her re-tested every six months. Our vet told me slow kill can take up to two years to be effective. Gulp. Until she's cleared, only mild-to-moderate exercise is allowed, so we don't run often and never run for long. When we get home from our half mile jog I do YouTube exercise videos and the cat joins in (a.k.a. he trips me). I also write in my journal. 5:45 p.m. — Internet kennel man gets here! We are mutually satisfied with our swap and I clean the kennel he gave me. He seemed like a nice responsible young man, but I'm paranoid about fleas. My cat and dog inspect and sniff the new kennel VERY closely. They're a regular bomb squad over here. ( got to me I guess.) I take a shower, wash my face, and apply rosehip oil. This oil is the BOMB (there I go again). My face was very acne-scarred and a little splotchy, and now I feel like an airbrushed IG model. 6:30 p.m. — I make dinner: pasta and spinach with a spicy sweet potato sauce. It's delicious! I watch while I eat. 7:30 p.m. — Curl up in bed with until a scheduled call with my friend. I reread the series every year and am on . I'm obsessed (and a Ravenclaw). 9 p.m. — I'm off the phone with my friend. She had work drama to discuss, and then we talked about my trip to visit her and her boyfriend (my other best friend from undergrad) in Philadelphia next week! I'm also going to see her this weekend, since we will randomly both be back in our hometown. I read until I start dozing off, then go to sleep. Daily Total: $41.36",2,266
"5:40 a.m. — I have the Sleep Cycle app, which wakes you up in the lightest stage of your sleep cycle within a 30-minute window. Sometimes the app and I disagree, however, so I snooze a little more when it goes off at 5:40. 6 a.m. — I'm up! I feed the animals and do a Yoga with Adriene video. I absolutely love her energy, and I always have a good day when I start it with one of her videos! 6:30 a.m. — Adriene was not playing today, so I take another shower before I get ready for work. I am finally caught up on r,  so I listen to an episode of . I pack coffee, lunch, and breakfast. 7:30 a.m. — At work, I drink my coffee and cranberry juice and eat my breakfast of instant oatmeal with coconut oil and coconut flakes. I'm a real coco-head. 10 a.m. — I have a meeting, so I scarf down leftover stale popcorn so I don't get hungry during it. Yes, I'm that coworker who complains about being hungry during every meeting: you're welcome. 12 p.m. — Lunchtime! I have leftover pasta with sweet potato sauce and read more . My favorite podcast ( ) recently did a five-part series on the East Area Rapist/Original Nightstalker, so I already know a lot about the case. However, I appreciate McNamara's thorough research and am enjoying the book overall. I'm looking forward to any possible speculations she may have about the identity of this creep. 2 p.m. — It's an afternoon of Internet research and catching up on the news. I eat peanut butter pretzels and a banana. My friend texts me about going to a -themed trivia in a few weeks. We love trivia and , so I am obviously down and make a note in my calendar. We decide our team will be ""The Bushiest Beavers."" 4 p.m. — I leave work and head to the library, which is right down the street from work. I FINALLY got a library card because my New Years Resolution was to read 50 books this year. I love our library and have put several books on hold. I pick up two: (fine, you caught me...I love true crime) and . My library card has encouraged me to try a lot of books I probably would not have otherwise bought, and I've read quite a few good ones so far this year! 4:20 p.m. — Home and time to take the dog on a walk! We do our usual circle but take a few detours so she can sniff new things. We also practice the command ""drop it,"" which she is struggling with, to put it mildly. 4:45 p.m. — I do dishes and pack for my weekend trip. I read a little bit of (I want to finish soon so I can get started on my growing stack of library books!) before making dinner. I heat up some of the sweet potato soup I bought and add some of the sweet potato sauce I made to it. It's a sweet potato bonanza. I eat it with bread and olive oil and watch . I gotta study up if I want to cream some nerds in a few weeks. 6:15 p.m. — My BF is home with a mattress topper for our bed. We recently bought a king-sized memory foam bed that sleeps pretty warm, so we got a mattress topper that has some kind of cooling gel in it. We tested it out and it worked fantastically, so we bit the bullet and bought one ourselves. I pay him back for half. $102 6:50 p.m. — I leave to head to my friend's house to share a drink before heading to a show ( at our local community theater. Going to live theater shows is my absolute favorite thing to do. Since my friend and I go to every show at our local theater, I am considering buying myself a season ticket pass to save money in the long run. We'll see. My friend bought us tickets a few days ago, so I pay him back now. $13 8 p.m. — I get a glass of red wine at the theater to enjoy during the show. $6 10:45 — Wow, what a stunning production. The entire show was fantastic. I say goodbye to my friend at his house and head home. I have a packet of ramen before brushing my teeth and going to bed. Daily Total: $121",3,266
"7 a.m. — I wake up, feed the pets, and make myself eggs and toast before getting ready. 8:30 a.m. — My brother is here to pick me up for our trip home. We chat with my boyfriend and I say goodbye to him and my precious pets and remind my BF a million times to clean the litter box. We chat and listen to horror movie podcasts in the car, and I read a little of my book. 11:30 a.m. — We arrive at my parents' house but no one is there, so my brother and I decide to get lunch at a sushi burrito place in the meantime. I stuff mine with tofu, cucumbers, seaweed, and spicy mayo. $10.70 2:30 p.m. — We head to our grandmother's condo to visit. It really is a nice surprise that both she and my other grandmother are visiting from out of town on the same weekend. My aunt is also over, so we spend time together catching up on family drama and arguing about who would be most valuable on (It would obviously be me.) I drink a Bud Lite that I found in the fridge. 4:45 p.m. — When we get back to my parent's house, we spend time catching up with the other grandma. For dinner, my brother wants to try a new Korean place, and we all agree that sounds good. 5:45 p.m. — We get to the restaurant and are seated immediately. My brother spends way too much time talking about his recent vacation to Japan, and I order a soft tofu vegetable soup called sundubu-jjigae and a Kirin. The soup is absolutely delicious, and I make a mental note to look up a recipe to see if I can recreate it at home. My grandmother grabs the bill from my brother, so the meal is free. 7:15 p.m. — My mom and I take her stinky Boston Terrier mix on a walk and gossip. I love catching up with her, and after going to undergrad almost five hours away, it's nice that I live a little closer now. When we get home, we watch with my grandma until my sister gets home. 9:30 p.m. — My sister shows up LITERALLY dressed like the women from the ""Women and Women First"" skit on Portlandia, and is very mad at me for teasing her about it. She tells me all about the event she was volunteering at. I'm getting tired, so I ask her to drive me back to our other grandmother's condo, where my brother and I are staying the night. He's off hanging out with a friend from high school and won't be back until late. I sweeten the deal by offering to buy her a McFlurry, and she accepts. $3.20 11:15 p.m. — My grandma and I watch before I turn in for the night. I wash my face, apply rosehip oil, brush my teeth, and am conked out within two minutes of getting into bed. Daily Total: $13.90",4,266
"8:30 a.m. — With no pets singing the songs of their people in the morning, I am able to sleep in a little bit. Still, I miss their morning kisses and sweet little faces. I rifle through my grandma's fridge looking for breakfast, and settle on a bagel with cream cheese before getting ready for the day. 9:30 a.m. — My brother and I leave to head to my parent's house. My mom is making mozzarella sticks, and I have a few. 10 a.m. — My friend (the one I caught up with on the phone) comes over, bearing gifts! Whenever she orders makeup and doesn't like it, she saves it to bring over for us. When we saw her at Christmas, my mom mentioned wanting a certain ColourPop eyeshadow pallet, and it turns out my friend got it as a free gift with a recent order, so she gives it to my mom. My mom screams with excitement and immediately starts rubbing the shadow all over her hand. My friend also hands over a book she recently finished and wants me to read. It is called by Magda Szabo. This TBR pile is real, y'all. 12:30 p.m. — My friend leaves, and we have lunch. My mom has made an excellent spread and I chow down on vegetarian chili, a green salad, cheesy bread, and corn chowder. I wish I lived in this house still, where the corn chowder flows freely. 1:45 p.m. — Time to head back to Tallahassee! My mom sends us off with a cantaloupe each, for which I am grateful. I will take all of the free food, please. We say bye and get on the highway. I read more of my book and nap. 3 p.m. — We stop to get gas and both decide we want a soda as well. While I am near the soda fountain, an employee accidentally drops all the soda lids, and I help her pick them up. I guess her manager saw me, because when I try to check out with my soda, they give it to me for free! How nice of them! I give my brother a little money for gas. $5.50 4:30 p.m. — We're home! When we roll into my apartment parking lot we see my boyfriend out walking our dog, who is so excited to see me she practically drags my BF over to the car. My brother comes upstairs with us to say hi to my cat and then heads back to his house. My BF and I assess our food situation and decide to pick up a few things at Publix. I get BOGO coffee, salsa, and deli slices, as well as Tostitos, chickpeas, and split peas. I also get dry cat food ($6.39). When we get home, we unpack and make dinner. I make pasta with marinara sauce and split peas. It's filling but not very satisfying, so I also have a Girl Scout cookie. $27.48 7 p.m. — I go over to my friend's house to hang out, and bring chips and salsa. I leave at around 11:45 and crash into bed at close to 1 a.m., which is unusually late for me. I'll be feeling this tomorrow. Daily Total: $32.98",5,266
"6:45 a.m. — My alarm goes off. I got a terrible night's sleep and woke up almost every hour. My BF and I snuggle a bit before I drag myself out of bed. I feed the animals, clean the litter box, and get ready for work while listening to and chugging coffee. I make an egg sandwich and head to work. 8 a.m. — I am at work and extremely sleepy. I eat my sandwich and drink more coffee. Once the coffee kicks in I get down to work business while listening to more My brother texts me about our cell phone bill. My portion is cheaper than expected this month because I just switched to a cheaper plan, but I didn't expect the savings to kick in so soon. I Venmo him my share of the bill and put the excess of what I had set aside in savings. 11 a.m. — I pause for a cup of coffee and peanut butter pretzels. I'm super hungry today. 12 p.m. — I stop for lunch, which is the last of the peanut butter pasta from last week. It is not so good and makes me feel nauseous. I remember an apple I left in the fridge at work and eat that to tide me over. I am still reading , but see a light at the end of the tunnel! 3:45 p.m. — I've done all I can do, and leave work early with thoughts of taking a nap. I snuggle in bed with my pets, but my cat wouldn't stop kneading my hair and my dog insists on lying right on my bladder, so I kick them out. After that, they whine and meow outside the door, so I never end up falling asleep. I'm very frustrated and on the verge of an anxiety meltdown by the time my BF gets home. 5 p.m. — I take the dog on a walk to try to clear my head, but she must be sensing my anxiety, because she's acting up. I cut the walk short and ask my BF to take our dog back out so she can get her exercise. I lay back down, do some deep breathing exercises, and remind myself I will get a good night's sleep tonight, so there's no need to feel this anxious. It helps a little bit. It helps even more when my BF gets back and offers to order us Chinese food. 6:15 p.m. — The food gets here. I ordered Szechuan tofu, a vegetable medley, and fried rice. We load up our plates and sit down in front of this week's . The segment tonight is on the NRA, which is a group all too familiar to us Floridians. After Johnny O., we snuggle on the couch and watch an episode of , some funny YouTube videos, and the beginning of a Katt Williams stand-up special on Netflix. 8 p.m. — I climb into bed and read for a few chapters before switching to . I finish and consider moving on to , but remember I need an extra good night's sleep tonight. I make a cup of Pukka Night Time tea (THE BEST tea for falling asleep!) and am out by 9.

"6 a.m. — My alarm goes off and I feel approximately one million times better. I snuggle with my honey for a few minutes and then get up to feed the pets. I put on my exercise clothes and stretch for a few minutes before doing about twenty minutes of butt and leg exercises. Afterwards, I shower and do my makeup while listening to 7:30 a.m. — I want today to be extra nice after yesterday's exhaustion fest, so I pull out my French press for my morning coffee. I also make a mango, banana, chia seed, and coconut milk smoothie for breakfast and a sandwich with Field Roast deli slices, spicy pickles, spinach, spicy mustard, and mayo for lunch. I pack everything up and leave for work. 8 a.m. — At work I catch up on the news while drinking my smoothie and coffee. I also check my bank account to make sure all of my Venmos have gone through. I work more on a survey I began yesterday while listening to showtunes, taking breaks to eat peanut butter pretzels when necessary. 11:50 a.m. — The pretzels aren't cutting it anymore, so I break for lunch. I have my sandwich with chips and salsa and a big glass of water while reading my book. When I'm done eating I take a little extra time to write in my journal and process some thoughts I had over the weekend. MyBF also texts me to make him a haircut appointment. His barber shop only takes appointments through an app, and that app only works on my phone! He is very particular about his hair and his barber, though, so I double-check all of the details he gives me before making the appointment for him. 1 p.m. — I make a cup of green tea to ward off the after-lunch sleepies and get back to work on my survey. 4:30 p.m. — After a pretty uneventful but productive afternoon, I head home. I feed my pets and when they're done eating, I pick my cat up like a baby and tickle his tummy. He's been acting extra naughty lately and I make a mental note to play with him more, because I think he just wants attention. I clip on my dog's leash and load up the new season of . We take an extra long walk while I figure out what, exactly, somebody knows. 5:30 p.m. — When we get home, I take a shower so my hair can dry before bed. I find it looks best when I do this. I consider doing a face mask, but my face feels a little irritated so I just rub on my rosehip oil. I am fairly low maintenance with my skincare routine and only use all-natural products. I wash with honey and moisturize with the oil, and will usually exfoliate a few times a week with a blend of coffee grounds and coconut oil. However, my mom got me a SheaMoisture exfoliating scrub that I've been using recently, and I think that's what's making my skin irritated, so I'll probably stop using it. After my shower, I fold and put away laundry that I managed to wash yesterday, empty the dishwasher, and wipe down my kitchen counters. 6:30 p.m. — My brother is over for a scary movie! I heat up leftover Chinese food, grab us beers, and we settle into to watch . It was very hyped online and while it was scary, and I love supernatural/possession horror, it wasn't ""the scariest movie of all time."" 8:15 p.m. — My brother leaves and I watch and episode of to unwind while cuddling with my cat. He drools when he purrs, which is simultaneously gross and very adorable. 8:45 p.m. — After my episode is over, I pull my boyfriend away from his video game to spend time with me in the bedroom. We take a quick shower afterwards and cuddle a bit before lights out. Daily Total: $0",7,266
"6 a.m. — I wake up, make a cup of black tea, and watch the local news for about a half hour. I let the dogs out in the backyard to run around. This was one of the main reasons we wanted to move to the suburbs – for the space! I pack Greek yogurt with almond butter, honey, and granola for my breakfast, ground chicken lettuce cups for lunch, and a can of lime seltzer water. Then I do my face routine: wash with plain raw honey, spritz with Caudalie Water to calm my rosacea cheeks, rub a drop of The Ordinary Hyaluronic Acid on my forehead, dab on a little Belif eye cream, layer Cetaphil SPF 30 sunscreen on top, and then apply a few dots of Glossier Perfecting Skin Tint on my cheeks, too, because of the rosacea redness. My boyfriend and I carpool into the city together at 7:45. I drop him off at the train and get to work by 8:20. 12 p.m. — I always use my lunch break to take a walk, even in the cold. I really need to stretch my legs and get as far away from my office as possible. Today I call my little sister and we have a nice chat. She and I are going to Myrtle Beach for a long weekend this month. My mom is letting us use her timeshare points, so the resort is free for us. Another friend is joining and agreed to drive, so I'm splitting the cost of gas and tolls with her. When I get back from my walk, I microwave my ground chicken stir-fry in the microwave and spoon it into the lettuce cups I brought – so tasty and satisfying. Most of my coworkers take their lunch breaks around this time, so the office is nearly empty while I eat at my desk. 3 p.m. — My energy is starting to drag – time for a green tea! Coffee and tea are free at my office. 5 p.m. — I pick up my boyfriend and we leave the city. We have to stop at Autozone to get a new bulb for my headlight, since we noticed it burned out the day before. I also get gas while we're out because I'm a nervous person and don't like driving with less than a quarter tank. I drive a little baby Nissan, so it's only $22 to fill it up. $33 6:15 p.m. — After I drop off the BF at home and change into exercise clothes, I drive to the gym. We have only been in Wilmington about six months, and I'm still getting used to having to drive EVERYWHERE. It takes 15 to 20 minutes to get to the gym from our house. I want to stay for an hour to make the drive worth it, so I do 30 minutes on the elliptical, 25-ish minutes of weights (arms today), a one-minute plank, and then run as fast as I can (not very fast at all in comparison to most people – ha) for five minutes. I hate running! That's why it's last! 7:45 p.m. — BF makes chicken thighs with roasted red potatoes and carrots for dinner. We bought meal stuff over the weekend to last us the whole week. Our grocery bill is typically around $150 for the week, and we split it down the middle. Daily Total: $33",1,267
"6 a.m. — We're having a big meeting at work today and I want to look nice, so I take a little longer getting ready and end up running late. Oops! I grab a thinkThin bar for breakfast. It's nearing the first of the month, so I send out my mortgage and trash checks. The taxes in Wilmington are super cheap (which is one of the reasons I like living here), but you end up having to pay for a lot of things yourself, like monthly trash removal. 12 p.m. — I take my usual walk for about 45 minutes before returning to the office and eating more of the ground chicken and lettuce cups that I prepped Sunday. 3 p.m. — I am a creature of habit, so 3 p.m. is typically when I need a pick-me-up. I have my Suja Uber Greens juice and a banana that I brought. This day is DRAGGING. 6 p.m. — BF and I stop at PetSmart on the way home, because my angel baby Pearl is low on dog food ($35). I also pick up cheap Milk-Bone teeth cleaning chews for both our dogs ($4.99 for a box of five). Then I make dinner. We have chorizo tacos with all the fixin's. $34.99 8 p.m. — I decide to unwind by taking an edible. My BF handles all pot-related transactions, so it's free for me. I get too stoned and eat two humongous bowls of granola with almond milk. I feel so sick and go to bed early, only to wake up at 12:30 a.m. and puke. Awesome. Daily Total: $34.99",2,267
"9:30 a.m. — I sleep in because of my midnight barfing incident. BF takes his car to work without me. I pop a pork shoulder in the Crock-Pot before lazily getting ready and getting to work around noon. Once there, I grab a free coffee to put some pep in my step. I'm not ready for real food yet. 5 p.m. — I leave work and go straight home, even though I usually go to the gym on Wednesdays. I pull the pork out of the Crock-Pot and shred it, then make cilantro rice and guacamole for rice bowls. (We eat a lot of spicy food in our house!) We watch because there's literally nothing else to watch, and I eat an orange for dessert. (I just canceled Hulu and Sling because I have too many subscriptions and need to save money however I can.) 9 p.m. — I'm a night shower-er because I like feeling clean when I hit the sheets. Tonight I do a Biore nose strip after my shower, followed by a face mask (Glossier Mega Greens Galaxy Pack). It's just okay. I will probably go back to using Kiehl's when I use this stuff up. Daily Total: $0",3,267
"6 a.m. — Start things off with a black tea. Get ready for work and hit the road by 7:45. My BF works from home on Thursdays and Fridays, so I'm on my own. I pack a smoothie for breakfast made of steamed carrots, orange juice, frozen strawberries, ginger, and turmeric. It tastes good and I personally believe it makes me ~glow~ but maybe I'm wrong. 12 p.m. — It's raining, so I can't go for a walk during my break. Instead, I take a nap in the back seat of my car for 45 minutes. When I wake up, I microwave leftover pork and rice from last night. 3 p.m. — Green tea time! I also brought a hard-boiled egg from home. I don't really like eggs, but people say they're good for you, so I eat it! 5:30 p.m. — I get home from work and my BF has dinner ready. It's roasted brussels sprouts with bacon, blue cheese, and a balsamic glaze (a recipe from Chrissy Teigen's cookbook). We use her recipes all the damn time. Like, so much that the outside of the book is sticky from ingredients getting all over it. 7:30 p.m. — We go to the movies to see . We both read the book and were really excited about seeing the film. We have MoviePass, so the tickets don't cost anything. My boyfriend got me a $90 year-long subscription for Christmas. We see movies about once a week, so it's definitely worth it for us. Daily Total: $0",4,267
"7 a.m. — I sleep in a little because we were up late. I grab a thinkThin bar for breakfast. I just remembered it's Lent and I'm not eating meat on Fridays. I can't think of anything meatless to bring for lunch, so I leave empty-handed. 9:30 a.m. — It's PAYDAY. Once I'm settled in at work, I throw $25 at my credit card payment. 12 p.m. — I take my lunchtime walk for 45 minutes. My sister doesn't answer the phone, so I listen to my cardio playlist on Spotify while I walk. There's not much around my office other than fast food, and since I didn't bring anything to eat, I just have a couple scoops of my almond butter that I keep in the work fridge. 5:30 p.m. — I go straight home after work. BF asks what to make for dinner. We both want something easy, so we drive to Food Lion and pick up two cans of Campbell's tomato soup and a head of broccoli. We make the soup with sautéed broccoli and roasted red potatoes on the side. Voila. Meatless meal. I also eat a handful of white chocolate chips from the pantry, because I want dessert and I'm stoned. Again. $8.12 Daily Total: $8.12",5,267
"9 a.m. — I roll out of bed and let the dogs out. We both have to be up because we're getting our new dryer delivered between 9 a.m. and 2 p.m. I make a pot of coffee. 10 a.m. — Dryer delivery dudes call and say they'll actually get here between 2 and 5 p.m. I'm annoyed with anything that takes up time on my Saturday, so I drive to the gym and do 45 minutes of useless cardio and then a bunch of crunches on the mat. 11:30 a.m. — I get home, shower, and am voracious. I eat leftover pork, black bean hummus with carrots (that have been in the fridge for a while), pickle chips, Greek yogurt with honey and almond butter, and a few pieces of salami. Then I get stoned and watch an old ABC Family movie on Netflix. I'm not known for making good choices! 5 p.m. — We decide to get an early dinner and try out a Mexican restaurant we haven't been to before. I get the shrimp fajitas and my boyfriend pays. Then, we walk to a nearby frozen yogurt place. BF doesn't eat many sweets, so I treat myself to a banana frozen yogurt with coconut, cherries, and whipped cream on top. We swing by the movies to see , but it's completely sold out, so we just go home. $4.55 Daily Total: $4.55",6,267
"9 a.m. — It's G-Day, a.k.a. Grocery Store Day, where we do all our shopping for the week. Last weekend, my BF paid for the whole thing because my bank account was on E, so it's my turn, and luckily, I just got paid. I do all our meal-planning and list-making for the week. The only reason he comes with me is to carry it all, honestly. $167.73 11:30 a.m. — I'm hit with the major Sunday scaries, so BF puts the groceries away and I lie in bed for five minutes to calm myself down. (Some people call this ""meditating."") I get up, take a puff of our vape, and chop up a head of cauliflower to roast in the oven for our lunch. I coat the cauliflower in buffalo sauce for our meatless version of buffalo ""wings"" and put on on Netflix to make myself feel better. I pop a load of laundry in the washer to feel extra accomplished. 2 p.m. — My movie is over, so I start making a big pot of chili. This will be our dinner tonight and lunch for a few days this week. I nap for two hours while the chili simmers and BF plays video games in his home office. Daily Total: $167.73",7,267
"11 a.m. — I don't always sleep in this late on weekends, but last night I went to a warehouse show in Bushwick until 3 a.m. My friend who lives about an eight-minute walk away invites me over to make brunch. I bring an avocado and goat cheese as my contribution. We gossip over omelets and then play a rousing game of Monopoly, which we agree is the perfect escape from reality. 4:45 p.m. — I walk to another friend's apartment, which is only 10 minutes away. I'm going to get my ID and credit card, which I left in her wallet last night, but we inevitably chat and snack for a bit before I leave. Snacking really gets me through this Sunday, both emotionally and financially. 8 p.m. — I take a yoga class to rejuvenate after an expensive and unhealthy (albeit extremely fun) weekend. I'm not sure what “toxins” actually are, but by the end I feel like I've released them, and my body is reset. I go home, shower, and watch an episode of before falling asleep around 11 p.m. Daily Total: $0",1,268
"6:45 a.m. — Thankfully it's light outside when my alarm goes off, because this is my first day back at work after spring break, and I've gotten very used to sleeping past 7 a.m. I prepared my breakfast and lunch last night, so I throw them in my L.L. Bean lunch box. I always make coffee at home to save time and money, and I drink it while I listen to a podcast on my commute. Today, it's an episode of NPR's about an Afro-Latina musician named Amara La Negra. 9:45 a.m. — I'm trying to be more chill at work, since I have a tendency to overthink and overwork in order to make things perfect. I create a schedule for the week that allows me to just supervise and manage, which are the most important parts of my role. I eat the breakfast I packed for myself (Greek yogurt, Trader Joe's almond clusters, and a little honey) while volunteers tutor our students. 12 p.m. — My breakfast is never enough to keep me full for long. I eat my lunch (leftover Trader Joe's ravioli with roasted asparagus and eggplant that I made last week) while doing some data entry. 3:30 p.m. — I leave work shortly after the school day ends and sneak in a quick trip to the gym before my weekly therapy appointment in Soho. I started seeing my therapist about six months ago, and I seriously look forward to it every week. 6:30 p.m. — I get home and call my mom — it's her birthday! I'm heading to the grocery store and ask her if she's cooked anything especially good recently. She is basically paleo, and I am , but she makes a lot of creative stuff, so I seek inspiration from her from time to time. She suggests I buy cauliflower to roast, and I do. I call my best friend in Chicago while shopping and charge the groceries to my EBT card. (I receive $194 per month in food stamps.) I head home to meal prep for the rest of the week with the items I just bought and stuff I already have from my last Trader Joe's trip. ($24.79 expensed) 8:30 p.m. — My roommate, A., and I watch an old episode of , our second favorite MTV reality show, and I munch on pasta with roasted cauliflower, zucchini, and collard greens, topped with goat cheese and marinara. I save the rest in a Tupperware for a future lunch and head to bed by 10 p.m. feeling envious of the cast members of the show, who just won true love and their share of $750,000.

"6:45 a.m. — It is so hard to wake up today. I leave with coffee in hand, but it feels like no amount of caffeine will be enough to enliven me. 10:30 a.m. — Yogurt and almonds time. 12:45 p.m. — Today I have to eat my lunch while tutoring a student. Usually they make fun of me for eating food that they think is weird. The best comment I've heard was: “Miss, why are you eating grass? That's soooo nasty.” But today the kids are unfazed by my mishmash of wild rice, lentils, Trader Joe's Vegetable Masala veggie burger, and roasted veggies. 3:30 p.m. — At the gym, I spontaneously decide to do the Arc Trainer, and then quickly realize I have no clue what it even is. Seriously, what is it? All I know is, my quads are burning. 5 p.m. — I shower and fry up Trader Joe's Thai Vegetable Gyoza, which I eat with soy sauce and Sriracha for an early dinner before Hindi class, which is (unfortunately) in Midtown. I stop by the dry cleaner on the way to drop off two pairs of pants that ripped in the last few weeks. One tore when it got caught on a door handle. How does that even happen? The teller says they'll be ready by Thursday but charges me up front. The price you pay for buying cheap jeans. $36 Daily Total: $36",3,268
"7:25 a.m. — I get to sleep in! Since most of my students are going on a field trip to the circus and the rest are doing state testing (#CynthiaNixonforGovernor), I'll be spending the day helping out at a different school that's closer to where I live. I still bring coffee. 10 a.m. — After tutoring an adorable student, I eat my yogurt and granola while catching up on the news. Paul Ryan announced he will not seek reelection, and I am ecstatic. Then I Google him and find out his sign is Aquarius, which is odd since he is a spineless sheep. 12:55 p.m. — I find it virtually impossible to meal prep enough for an entire week, so I try to keep a few pre-made lunches around. Today I'm microwaving Trader Joe's Paneer Tikka Masala, which is not the most filling, but is excellent as far as affordable frozen vegetarian meals go. As I eat, I buy bus tickets to go to D.C. with a friend this weekend! It's our last chance to see the cherry blossoms, and I've been itching to get out of the city for a night. Since we're going Friday to Saturday and booking last minute, tickets aren't the cheapest ($88 total). I pay, and he Venmos me his half. $44 3:15 p.m. — I get to walk home from work today, which is thrilling. (This is not sarcasm; April has been very cold.) I eat two clementines along the way and listen to DeRay McKesson's podcast, . At home, I try to work on grad school applications, but mostly scroll through Instagram. 5:15 p.m. — Go to yoga. Sufficiently sore, I come home and watch an episode of (I've already seen it, I'm just rewatching it because it's the best television show created in the history of humankind.) For dinner I cook Trader Joe's Mandarin Orange Morsels (orange-flavored fake chicken) and a scallion pancake. 8 p.m. — I'm going on a date! We matched on Tinder, and it's our second time hanging out. Dating is hard and second dates are scarce, so I'm excited. I chose a bar in my neighborhood last time, so tonight he picked the spot, and I make the trek into Manhattan. Last time, I introduced him to Narragansett, my favorite cheap beer (I'm biased because last year I lived in Rhode Island, where it's made). The bar has cans for $3, much to our satisfaction. He puts down his card, and there's a minimum; I tell him I'll get the drinks at the next spot. After two beers each, we walk to a nearby bar that a friend suggested. It's little more upscale, so we get the cheapest thing on the menu: $5 Tecates. We bond over our mutual disdain for olives, and he walks me to the train. $12.89 Daily Total: $56.89",4,268
"6:40 a.m. — Ugh. Going to work after a night of three beers is the worst. Once I get to my desk, I munch on a granola bar in the hopes that it will revive me. 9:45 a.m. — Coffee saves the day again. I only had a little yogurt left for today and tomorrow, so I eat the mini portion of it I threw in a Tupperware this morning. 11:25 a.m. — Clementine snack. I am a snacker. 12:20 p.m. — A student and a tutor who are working together have the same name, and they are loving it. I observe their lesson while I eat my lunch (pasta with the same vegetable mix from earlier in the week). 3 p.m. — Grateful I made it through the day, I head to the gym. I'm making myself go because I know I won't have time tomorrow between work and catching the bus to D.C. I do a lackluster workout and walk home, where I find my roommate made chocolate chip cookies! I immediately snack on them, as well as Salt & Vinegar Kettle Chips (my favorite food of all time, probably), and continue working on grad school applications with playing in the background. 7:20 p.m. — A. and I are lounging on the couch and she makes a box of bowties. I already had pasta for lunch, but I can't pass up an opportunity to avoid cooking, so I eat it anyway, with marinara and goat cheese. 8:25 p.m. — D., another roommate, and I go to trivia at a bar around the corner from our apartment. We love it there because it's so low stakes — there are only four rounds and the guy running it asks the question through a megaphone. I stick to water to save money for the weekend and make it to bed by 10:30 p.m. Daily Total: $0",5,268
"6:45 a.m. — That extra hour of sleep seriously makes all the difference. I wouldn't say I feel lively, but I feel like my normal self. I grab my lunch box and coffee and head out for the day. 10 a.m. — I eat the last of the yogurt and granola. 12:50 p.m. — Okay, so I experimented with a new lunch today and it was...disappointing. The idea was a DIY burrito bowl: a combo of rice, black beans, corn, avocado, Trader Joe's Soy Chorizo, chile lime salt, and oven-baked tofu. Where did I go wrong? It definitely wasn't bad, but, how can I improve this meal? Lettuce? Lime? Skip the tofu? 4 p.m. — After dropping my laptop at home and grabbing my bag for D.C., I hop on the train to meet my friend, V., in Midtown for our bus. I get there early and run into Duane Reade for snacks: Clif bar, mini pack of Milanos, and a lime seltzer. (I pay using food stamps.) V. and I meet on 7th Avenue and wait for our steed. ($11.89 expensed) 6 p.m. — Things take a turn. Turns out, buying the cheapest Friday afternoon bus tickets from New York to D.C. is not a wise spending choice. We haven't even made it to the Lincoln Tunnel yet when we get into a fender bender. We're waiting on the street for upwards of an hour with no information, so V. and I call the bus company to try to get a refund. They pretend they can't hear us and hang up — a bad omen for Friday the 13th — and the driver shuffles us back on the bus. We think we're finally leaving, until we realize the driver is not on the bus and has locked us in. Nightmares become reality. The emergency exit is locked, too. Some other passengers are freaking out with us, but others still have their headphones on and are pulling out their dinners. It's bizarre. Eventually, V. slams on the horn until the driver comes back and lets us out. We run out and eat the cost of the bus tickets in favor of not being trapped in a moving vehicle for five hours. 9:30 p.m. — Safely back in Brooklyn, we buy two bottles of wine and bring them back to my apartment, where A. and her friend are also hanging out and drinking wine. My appetite returns; I eat a box of Kraft Mac & Cheese and we chat until our anxiety subsides. $13 Daily Total: $13",6,268
"8:45 a.m. — I wake up early for a Saturday, since I crashed by midnight last night (thank you, half bottle of rosé). It's a beautiful day — the first real day of spring we've seen in NYC — so I drink coffee and go for a run outside (!) around Prospect Park. I'm back by 10:45 a.m. to wash my face and grab my wallet for brunch. 11 a.m. — A friend from college who lives in Boston is in town for a hot sec, so a bunch of us catch up over brunch at Barboncino, our favorite bougie pizza place. I eat half of a pear and gorgonzola pizza and save the rest for a lunch next week. My friend puts down her card and we Venmo her. After brunch, we take advantage of the warm weather and walk to the park. I end up playing Spike Ball for the second time ever, which is a very fun game, even if you suck at it. $19 5:15 p.m. — V. and I are hanging out tonight to make up for our D.C. dreams being crushed. We head to the East Village for an early dinner with another friend. She does theater and works weird hours, so we're meeting her during her break before a rehearsal. We wander around 2nd Avenue and eventually settle on Mighty Quinn's Barbecue, even though two of us are vegetarians, because the sides are delicious and the windows are open. We gossip over mac and cheese, kale slaw, and sweet potato casserole before she goes back to rehearsal. $11.05 7 p.m. — V.'s been wanting new clothes, so I decide to be his personal shopper for the evening. We go to Muji, where he gets an amazing pair of navy linen pants, and Uniqlo for basics. I see a short-sleeve tan linen button-down that I know will look amazing on him and buy it for him as an early birthday present ($19.90). Our last stop is & Other Stories, where we try all the perfumes and lotions, and I buy a much-needed pair of sunglasses ($20.69). $40.59 9 p.m. — Since we're in SoHo, I realize I know a great bar — the one I went to on my date on Wednesday! I feel a little weird going back so soon after, but it's the only good spot we know in the area, so we do it anyway. V. gets a Dark and Stormy and I get a $3 can of Narragansett (plus a $1 tip). He heads uptown for a party, and I go back to Brooklyn. $4 11 p.m. — I meet my friends at Crown Inn and decide to save money and skip the drink. I sip on water while we have a rousing discussion about cultural things that are over- and underrated. I make it to bed shortly after midnight. Daily Total: $74.64",7,268
"9:30 a.m. — We were up late last night, so I sleep a little later than normal. I generally spend about an hour in bed when I wake up dealing with messages and emails. I'm not a morning person, so I prefer to get work done that doesn't actually involve speaking first thing in the morning. 10:30 a.m. — My husband takes my car to the store to buy a fifth wheel hitch so he can work on his truck while I'm out running errands. We just got a new RV, which means new toys for the truck – a.k.a. man heaven. I'm not enthused about this large purchase, but it's necessary. $1,180 11:30 a.m. — Errand time! First stop – the pet store to grab digestive enzymes for my disgusting, poop-eating dog. This is the second bottle I've gotten her and fortunately, it seems to be working. I grab a toy while I'm there because my dogs are spoiled ($35.51). Target is next up on the agenda. I need tampons and they're the only store in town with the organic cotton ones I like. I run into a friend while I'm there, and we talk for quite a while before deciding we should both move on with our days. I grab a couple loofahs ($5) and a few pints of Ben & Jerry's because they're on sale! Ice cream is pretty much my kryptonite, especially when I'm on my period. I head straight to the checkout to avoid any more temptation ($26.49). $67 1:15 p.m. — I stop for gas before I get home. $62.37 1:30 p.m. — Back at home, I give the doggies their new ball, put my purchases away, and tidy up the kitchen while my husband finishes his project in the garage. By the time I'm done with that, my pitbull has already chewed a hole in the damn thing. I'm not shocked, but man it would be nice if a toy lasted more than an hour around here! 2:45 p.m. — Most of my business is done online, which is awesome. I do a quick motivational Facebook live on my business page and then another one in my team group explaining the qualifications for our next company trip. I work with an incredibly generous company – they sent me to Las Vegas in October and I am headed on a cruise to Bermuda in May. The next trip we're working towards is the Bahamas in November. I love to travel and it's even better when it's free! 3:15 p.m. — We leave our house to pick up my sister and brother-in-law, who live a mile away. We're headed to our uncle's surprise retirement party. 4 p.m. — Surprise! He arrives and is definitely surprised. It's nice to spend time with some of our family – it doesn't happen as often as it used to now that all the kids are adults. A couple of my cousins have little kids and two of them are there. It's fun to play with the kids, and then give them back! 5:30 p.m. — A friend is having a birthday dinner at 6 p.m. We want to stop by before we head to a show in Anchorage, so we leave to drop off my sister and brother-in-law. We stop at our house to drop the dogs off and do a little research since we heard the roads are really bad. Apparently the highway was shut down for three hours due to multiple car accidents. It's open now, but we decide to skip our appearance at dinner to give ourselves a little extra time for the drive. 6:30 p.m. — The show we're going to starts at 8 and we don't know what seating is going to be like, so we decide to head into town. My husband wants to read (what I'm sure is thrilling information) about his new hitch, so I drive. The roads aren't awesome by any means, but they're way better than we expected. We make it into Anchorage and I spend a solid 15 minutes driving around looking for free parking. (We're early, and I hate paying for parking!) There are apparently two other big events going on downtown, so we have to park several blocks away, but it's not too cold, so it's totally worth saving $20. 7:45 p.m. — We show up at the venue and there's already quite a line. It's a stand-up comedy show to benefit our local Planned Parenthood. The openers are funny, but the headliner has a sense of humor that isn't quite our style. It's okay, though, and we still have fun. I got these tickets a while ago, so we don't spend any money tonight. 10:15 p.m. — After the show we head to the airport to pick up our friend who's here for spring break. We stop by Taco Bell for a snack before heading back. $12.77 12 a.m. — Home at last! It's been a busy day, so we head straight to bed. Daily Total: $1,322.14",1,269
"1:40 a.m. — We're woken up by a call from the child protective services agency. We recently got licensed to be foster parents, and they have a child who needs an emergency placement. It sounds like this particular kiddo has a higher level of special needs than we're prepared to handle, so we decide to decline the placement. I have a hard time falling back asleep, wondering if it was the right decision. 9:15 a.m. — We're up! My husband heads to the garage for more work on the truck and I relax in bed with the pups. 10:30 a.m. — I actually get up and make myself look presentable. I have a scheduled video call with my team at noon, so I spend time preparing what I want to go over. I eat a protein bar, which will tide me over until our brunch plans later. 12 p.m. — My leadership team and I lead a successful call. This kind of stuff is important to our business and I really enjoy doing it. 1 p.m. — The mom of one of my husband's childhood friends is in town visiting, so we meet her for brunch. I've only met her once (she flew up for our wedding), but we keep in touch on Facebook. She's really sweet and it's nice to see her. She ends up generously picking up the bill. On the way home, we stop by Redbox and grab a few movies. While we're driving, we talk about the call we got last night and decide we want to call the social worker back and offer to take in the little boy if he still needs a place to go. Making that kind of decision in the middle of the night is pretty difficult, and we're feeling better about the situation now. His caseworker says she actually found him a placement with a special education teacher. We're happy to hear he's in a safe place. $4.54 3 p.m. — When we get home, we load up the truck to take the trash to the landfill. We don't pay for trash service because the landfill is less than five minutes away and it's way cheaper. Our borough sends a coupon in the mail twice a year, so today's load is only $2. $2 3:30 p.m. — Home! We've had a busy weekend, so we're both ready to plop down on the couch and watch our movies. We put in first and each snuggle up with a dog. 7:30 p.m. — We pause our movie marathon to order pizza ($22.77) and a crazy fry concoction from a burger place down the street ($7.99). My husband starts a load of laundry (because he's one of those amazing mythical beings who does his own!) and leaves to go pick up the food. I should get up and do something productive while he's gone, but I play Candy Crush instead. $30.76 9:30 p.m. — We made it all the way through Two movies in one day is pretty impressive for my husband, as he's not great at sitting still. He has to get up early for work, so it's bedtime. I always get in bed with him, but I read, get work done, or watch Netflix for hours before I'm actually ready to sleep. Tonight I choose ! 11:30 p.m. — This is early for me, but I'm actually pretty sleepy! I've been trying to get better at not staying up till 1 or 2 a.m., so it's sleep time. Daily Total: $37.30",2,269
"9 a.m. — I'm up! I take the dogs to daycare on Mondays, so I make myself get out of bed right away. My husband texts me and says he forgot to clip our pit's nails, so I need to do it before I drop them off. Ugh...I don't wanna! She's a squirmy little sucker and she hates it, but I get it done. I get them fed and off we go. They LOVE daycare. As soon as I turn onto the road they start freaking out because they know exactly where we are. 10 a.m. — Today's a work from home day and I have a lot of random things to get done. I set a timer on my phone for 30 minutes and sit down with a book. I have to time myself or else I won't get anything else done. I eat a protein bar for breakfast while reading. I really need to go grocery shopping today. When the timer goes off, I check my social media notifications, answer questions, and respond to the messages that came in while I was reading. I have an appointment at noon, so I need to get up and actually get ready for the day. 11:45 a.m. — I head to my lash extension appointment. The owner of the spa I work for does them. I hate lying still for so long, but it's amazing and I'm addicted. I typically get two fills a month. They're $75 a pop, but she gave me a freebie, which I use today. 1:30 p.m. — I go to the post office and realize I forgot my packing tape at home! I have a habit of walking out the door without all the things I need. I head to the store to pick up a few things. My husband travels a lot for work, but he'll be in town for most of the week, so I mainly need stuff for his lunches. There's only one grocery store around here with a good selection of organic produce, so I always shop there. Organic Honeycrisp apples are on sale! They're normally $4.59 per pound and today they're only $2.29. Serious score. I usually spend about $15 a week on five apples — that's Alaskan produce for ya! I grab carrots, radishes, lettuce, bananas, Alaska Grains bread (I try to buy locally-made things as much as possible), English muffins, cottage cheese, sliced cheese, Pop chips, and my weakness – white Monster energy drinks. I don't drink coffee and I don't have one every day – but what can I say, I just love them! $64.91 2:30 p.m. — I swing by my house to drop off groceries and pick up packing tape. I heat up leftover pizza for lunch and throw in a load of laundry. I snap a picture of my grocery receipt and enter it into my Receipt Hog and Receipt Pal apps. I get points every time I submit a receipt and can redeem them for Visa/Amazon gift cards. I've only been using them for a couple months and I think it'll take me about forever and a day before I earn anything substantial, but who am I to turn down free money?! 3 p.m. — Let's try this again! I almost left without the packing tape again...I always have a roll in my car because I make frequent trips to the post office, but I took it out when I got my car detailed a couple weeks ago. It's now back in its proper home – a.k.a. my cup holder. I stop at a little contract post office that only takes cash, so I pull money out of the ATM there. Of course there's a fee ($4). I mail a gift to one of my customers ($3.75). This post office is tiny and rarely has a line, so I forgive its cash-only status. Then I run right down the road to get two months' worth of probiotics ($40.11) from a nutritional store, before running into one last store because my husband forgot to tell me he needs mayo and a apparently a sandwich just isn't the same without it. I spy speckled jelly beans and I have to grab those too ($9.71). $57.57 4:30 p.m. — Sometimes the whole ""work from home"" thing doesn't involve a lot of time at home! I have time to get chores done before I have to pick up the dogs. I typically clean the house on Mondays and I'd like to get as much as I can out of the way before my husband gets home. Part of the deal of me being a work at home dog mom is that I do most of the cleaning and pack my husband's lunches. I think that's pretty darn fair since he works 60-80 hours per week. 6 p.m. — My husband gets home way earlier than usual, so we go pick up our fur children together. Daycare is worth every penny; they have so much fun and it wears them out. I'd love to be able to take them every day, but for now they typically go twice a week. I guess my husband got new tunes for his truck to help haul the fifth wheel better, so we're going on a test run to see how it drives. This is not my department, I'm just along for the ride. 7 p.m. — I cook dinner when we get home — chicken fettuccine alfredo. We watch an episode of while we eat. Most of the time we sit at the table without the TV, but we both kinda want to decompress tonight. After dinner, my husband has work to do for a class he's taking this week for his job. I prep lunches for the rest of the week: veggies, cottage cheese, and yogurt. 9 p.m. — I feel a migraine coming on, so I smoke pot and get in bed. I generally only smoke if I have a migraine or am getting one, which unfortunately is much more frequently than I appreciate. I bought this vape pen thing (which just makes me a little sad, because I think vaping is incredibly stupid, but it's convenient and doesn't dry out) at the dispensary for $90 about three months ago and the cartridge is about half gone. My drug habit is definitely cheaper than my prescription migraine medication! Daily Total: $122.48",3,269
"8:45 a.m. — I wake up and my head still hurts. It's better than last night, but definitely not gone. I'm super grateful for the night shift mode on my iPhone, because otherwise I couldn't even look at it when I have a migraine. I enter information into my Migraine Buddy app. It's supposed to help track patters and give me insights into what the causes are. I've gotten migraines since I was 12 and I still haven't figured it out! Today I have to be at the spa though, so since I'm not dying I get up, grab a quick breakfast and go. 10 a.m. — I have a few projects I'm working on here at the spa. I have a pretty set system of how I do things because I'm only here two and a half days per week, so I try to be as productive as possible. I'm almost constantly interrupted, but I'm used to it by now. This summer I'll be traveling with my husband for his job, so I'll be working remotely 90% of the time. I can't wait! 3 p.m. — The rest of the day is super hectic and I don't accomplish as much as I had hoped I would. It doesn't help that my head still hurts. 6:30 p.m. — I have a team video chat scheduled. I set up two per month for us to come together, do training, talk goals, and ask questions – whatever my team needs. I'm in communication with the people closely under me very frequently, but it's nice to touch base with my team members further down the line sometimes. 7;30 p.m. — Dinnertime! I hate cooking in general, especially when I've had a crazy day, so I throw together a pre-cooked roast and mashed potatoes. Easy and yummy. 10 p.m. — We get in bed and my husband almost instantly falls asleep. I take time to catch up on my social media and respond to messages. I haven't looked at Instagram all day! Social media is a big part of my business, but some days I just don't have the energy to keep up with it. It's probably time for a day off soon. Every once in a while I'll just put my phone away for the entire day, which is rather refreshing! I watch Netflix and finally go to sleep at about 2 a.m. Daily Total: $0",4,269
"9 a.m. — After hitting snooze a few times, I actually open my eyes all the way. I don't usually set an alarm, but I woke up earlier when my husband left and read for a while till I could fall back asleep, which always throws me off. My snuggly dogs make it incredibly difficult to get up. They want breakfast, and I need to get my act together and get ready. 10 a.m. — Get to the spa and get right to work. I have a project I've been working on for 10 months and I can finally see the light at the end of the tunnel! This will pretty much consume my time until it's finalized – hopefully next week. 2:30 p.m. — Take a mini break and eat cottage cheese, mandarins, and crackers. I try to get my husband to tell me what he wants for dinner – a.k.a. the hardest decision on the planet. 6:15 p.m. — I intended to go to the gym after work, but I forgot my gym bag and I'm just not feeling it. I normally go three to four times a week, but if I'm busy I don't force myself. I really enjoy working out, so I never want it to feel like a chore. I hop on the computer and submit our applications for our Permanent Fund dividends. It's an Alaska thing. Put extremely simply, each year, qualifying residents receive a payment tied to the oil revenue the state makes. It varies from year to year: In years past, I've gotten between $800 and $2,200. We have the option to select a nonprofit to pledge part of our dividends to. This year, we chose an organization that helps homeless teens in our area with housing, education, and job skills. I also order a Bite Agave Lip Mask from Sephora. My lips are insanely dry and a friend just recommended this, so I'm gonna try it out. It's $26, but I have a gift card. 8:30 p.m. — My husband just got home with tortillas, so I make tacos for dinner. You can literally never go wrong with tacos. I could eat them every day. We talk about our days and play with the dogs for a while after we eat. $4.29 10 p.m. — Bedtime for one of us! I stay up till about 12:30 reading and getting work done. Daily Total: $4.29",5,269
"8:15 a.m. — Somehow, morning has appeared again. I am so not a morning person, but I get up and feed the dogs and send my husband a good morning/thank you text. I didn't realize he put my car in the garage after he was done working on his truck last night. Much appreciated, as it's still about 15 degrees in the mornings. That message is shortly followed by a ""WTF?!"" one when I get out of the shower and realize he stole my towel. Scoundrel... I finish getting ready for the day. How much effort I put in definitely depends on how much sleep I want. I have lash extensions and my eyebrows are microbladed, so most days I mix Laura Mercier tinted moisturizer and Stila Stay All Day beauty balm, slap that on, and comb my brows and lashes. Piece of cake. I do like playing with makeup when I have time, but it's not my first priority. 10 a.m. — I drop the dogs off at daycare – and I don't even have to get out of the car! I open the back hatch, they jump out, and the owner meets them at the door. (They don't even turn around to say goodbye...) I head to the spa, where I work for a few hours. Thursdays are usually pretty quiet, so I can get work done in peace. 2:45 p.m. — I leave the spa later than normal because the owner comes in and we talk for a while. Now I'm going to the borough office to talk to them about a business license for our Airbnb, because I like talking to humans rather than trying to figure that stuff out online. Since we'll be traveling so much this summer, we've decided to take advantage of our absence and get Airbnb guests! While in the parking lot, I remember to pay our cell phone bill. We have a Verizon Up credit available, so I select a code for a free movie download from Vudu. 3 p.m. — That was easy! The lady was super nice and explained exactly what I needed to do. I run into the grocery store to buy a gallon of milk. We only buy milk that comes from our local dairy, because milk pus is a real thing, people! I drive by the dairy farm all the time, so I feel better knowing exactly where it comes from. $5.55 3:15 p.m. — Back at home, I make lunch and get to work. I have a decent amount of bookkeeping I need to finish up and send to our CPA for our taxes. I work on that, message with some of my customers, make a few social media posts, and overall have a very productive afternoon! I have to take a little break to run and get the dogs from daycare. 7:15 p.m. — We go to meet our friend we picked up from the airport the other night for dinner at our fave Mexican restaurant, which never disappoints. I have a weird thing where I need to make the total with tip an even number when I eat at restaurants, so it comes to $35. $35 10 p.m. — We go to bed pretty much as soon as we get home. I end up watching the Barack Obama and Malala Yousafzai episodes of David Letterman's on Netflix. It's an interesting show. Daily Total: $40.55",6,269
"8:30 a.m. — I wake up to the glorious sound of dogs barking. Dogs barking is like screaming babies to most other people — I can't stand it! I decide I may as well get up and start getting work done. I finalize my information and email it to our CPA. I'm crossing my fingers that he doesn't need anything else. I purchase both our state ($50) and borough ($100) business licenses. Next up is finalizing our Airbnb listing. I'm super excited and a little nervous. This summer is definitely going to be an adventure. $150 1 p.m. — My husband comes home to pack for his work trip. He doesn't typically work on weekends unless he's on call, but a good friend of ours is going through a crazy custody battle and the trial is next week, so he's going on his trip this weekend so we can both be there to support him. He tells me he picked up a bottle of insulin on his way home so he has extra to take with him. He's a Type 1 diabetic, which is not freakin' cheap! Neither one of use has health insurance through our jobs and there's no way we could afford it through the marketplace. It sucks, but we make it work. I am super anti-Walmart, but they have their own generic insulin for $25 a bottle instead of $300 at the pharmacy we used to get it from. I can be okay with Walmart once a month if it saves us about $550. $25.76 2 p.m. — Husband leaves for the airport. I'm never excited about that, but it's a frequent part of his job. Luckily, he's never gone for more than a few days at a time. 5:30 p.m. — A few friends come over so we can all ride together to a birthday dinner. We go to Benihana because she's never been there. Our chef is very funny and we have a lot of fun. Dinner is great, but of course this restaurant is more expensive for just me than dinner was for both of us last night ($43)! It's for a special occasion, though, and I'm glad I went. I purchased a gift card ($50) for her earlier in the day and a friend will split it with me later. $93 9:45 p.m. — We are not feeling like party animals, so we all head home. I get in my PJs, grab ice cream from the freezer, and find something to watch on Netflix. The only plus sides to my husband being gone are not having to cook dinner and being able to binge whatever show I want. I'm actually pretty tired, though, and I try to take advantage of any night I feel like falling asleep before midnight, so I head to bed. Daily Total: $268.76",7,269
"5:10 a.m. — My alarm rings just once before I catch it. My cat, begging for breakfast, woke me twenty minutes ago and I dutifully, albeit sleepily, fed her. I grab my outfit for the day off the top of my dresser and head to the shower. 5:30 a.m. — I listen to the most recent The Moth podcast as I get ready for the day. The episode is about the places we go that shape our lives. As the first story teller comments on the pain of leaving her home, I look up and see all the boxes in my own home. My lease is about to end, but this time I'm moving into a new home by myself, and the reality of my recent breakup hits me hard. I step away from the kitchen and find myself back in the bedroom. I open the closet and find one of my boyfriend's shirts, which smells like him. As tears stream down my face, I remind myself that the breakup is for the best, even though I don't fully believe that just yet. 5:40 a.m. — I come back to the kitchen but tune out the podcast. I pack a banana and a Tupperware of homemade ham and potato soup for lunch. I opt to have Thai takeout leftovers for breakfast instead of my usual smoothie. As I savor my Thai food, I heat water so I can bring a thermos of cinnamon black tea to work as I do every day. I'm on the road by 6 a.m. 11:30 a.m. — I'm a high school teacher, and my juniors are understandably struggling today after a week of standardizing tests including the dreaded SAT. I've had to be extra engaging all day today to make up for their lack of energy. Now it's lunchtime, and I plop into a seat in the staff lounge after heating up my soup. 3:30 p.m. — I'm home from work and it's the beginning of my weekend, but I start to wonder if I'm coming down with a cold. I scrounge around in the medicine cabinet to find DayQuil to help with my sore throat. It's raining outside, and the purple crocuses in the yard look beautiful during the storm. I force myself to be a bit productive by packing two boxes worth of books before taking a nap. 6 p.m. — I'm daydreaming about sushi, but make myself cook at home to save money. For dinner, I make pasta with a homemade sauce consisting of Italian sausage, onion, garlic, basil, diced tomatoes, and half-and-half. I pack up leftovers and bring them over to my friend's house. With me being sick and her being tired, we lazily spend the evening on her couch watching movies and talking. Despite it being a lackluster Friday night, I'm grateful for the company. I've been feeling lonely since my boyfriend (ex? that's painful to write) recently moved out. 10:30 p.m. — I make a pit stop at the local grocery store on my way home to pick up needed supplies before the ice storm kicks in: DayQuil, tissues, and cough drops. I head home and promptly go to sleep. $10.50 Daily Total: $10.50",1,270
"9:30 a.m. — I'm definitely sick. I don't normally sleep in this late. Before opening my eyes, I hear the rapping on my window. The rain must have turned to sleet. I turn to look outside and find myself sharing my pillow with my cat. I get out of bed, make green tea, prepare a simple smoothie, and sit down by a window to read after taking a healthy dose of cold medicine. 11 a.m. — I come into the kitchen to do my dishes and notice some of my food has spoiled. I throw away a number of clementines and salad mix. I feel bad wasting food, but it's certainly hard shopping and cooking for one person. I'm not used to it yet. 2 p.m. — I spend my early afternoon alternating between grading student papers and reading. I take a break and grab boxes from my car that I pilfered from work. I turn on a Spotify playlist and get to work taking down the art from my walls. 3 p.m. — I keep seeing on Facebook that a lot of businesses in the area are losing power and closing. I decide to shower and cook an early dinner just in case I lose power too. I fry potatoes on the stove and add garlic, cheese, and a fried egg on top. Simple, but tasty. 4 p.m. — The rain and general gloominess are relentless and uncharacteristic of April in Michigan. It's bringing me down. I've kept myself busy all day, but in this quiet moment, I think of my ex and my heart just aches. I want to reach out to him and see how he's doing, but I know I shouldn't and space is what we need right now. I look around the room and see constant reminders of him. This was our apartment, after all. I don't want to dwell in this sadness, so I make myself take a nap. 5 p.m. — I start focusing on my plans for the evening. Earlier in the week, I spontaneously reached out to Z., a guy I met in college. I asked him if he wanted to grab a drink sometime, and he said yes. We're meeting tonight in a few hours. I don't know if it's a date or not. I tell myself it isn't so I don't get nervous. As someone who has always been in long-term relationships, I haven't really dated as an adult. The thought freaks me out a bit. I take out my phone and do some light Facebook stalking. I don't think he has a girlfriend. I see recent pictures of him and his dog and of his recent travels. I make a mental note to ask him about both. 6:45 p.m. — A great part about my neighborhood is its walkability. I don a bunch of layers to protect myself from the wind and sleet and walk the few blocks to the restaurant where Z. and I are meeting. I arrive a bit early, take a seat near the back, and order a cider. 7 p.m. — As I wait for Z., a strange man walks up, makes a lot of eye contact, and bends over for a hug. I give him a one-armed hug as I rack my mind to figure out who he is. He starts to sit down and I say, ""Uhh, I don't think I'm the person you're meeting."" He realizes he's made a mistake and walks away abruptly. The people at the tables next to me chuckle. We assume he was on a Tinder date. I hope he found who he was actually looking for. 7:15 p.m. — Z. finds me and sits down. Over the next few hours, we talk about anything and everything: our travels, jobs, aspirations, college memories, and so on. The conversation flows easily. I like his smile. At one point, when ordering our second drinks, he says: ""I have to know – is this a date?"" I laugh and say that I don't really know, but it can be. He says he'd like that. For a moment, it's a bit uncomfortable, but our conversation picks up easily. 10:30 p.m. — By the end of the night, I've only had two drinks: a cider and a cocktail. With tip, the bill comes to $17.50. Before we leave, Z. says, ""Maybe this is too soon, but would you like to come over for dinner tomorrow? I'll cook."" He then adds, ""Just promise not to murder me."" I laugh because I appreciate a comment like that. He's right; spending time with a stranger does bring up questions about safety, at least for me. I tell him yes, and that that would be nice. We part ways with a second date in the books. I walk home and head to bed. $17.50 Daily Total: $17.50",2,270
"7:30 a.m. — I can't seem to fall back asleep, so I get up. While feeding my cat, I look out the window and see my car covered in a layer of ice. I have brunch plans with a few friends today and wonder if it'll end up being cancelled because no one wants to drive. 8:30 a.m. — The only sound I can hear is the howling wind. I'm on my computer in the breakfast nook and start looking at flights on Kayak. I'm heading to California this summer to participate in a National Endowment for the Humanities institute and I need to book my own transportation. One-way tickets from Grand Rapids to San Jose are $285. I decide to wait a few days to buy one to see if I can get a better price. 10:30 a.m. — There's a lot of back and forth in our group text on whether or not to cancel brunch. We ultimately decide to. I start daydreaming about a snow day tomorrow and getting my hopes up (hey, it's one of the perks of being a teacher!). As I start to plan the rest of my day, I toast an English muffin and slather on a generous amount of peanut butter and strawberry-rhubarb jam from the farmer's market. 1:30 p.m. — I inevitably start to feel a bit stir-crazy. I've been doing much of the same for the last few days and start feeling unsatisfied. While I'm sitting on the couch brushing my cat, my mind wanders to my ex. The pain and loss is a palpable thing. My chest hurts and I feel so heavy. I reach out to my best friend, M., through text for a bit of reassurance. I tell her how scared I am of the future and all the unknowns, about how the newness feels so heavy. M. sends a series of texts back: ""Be a little kinder to yourself and where you are and the decisions you're making. I think you're being too hard on yourself again. Each day gets you closer to where you want to be. Set small goals and allow life to happen."" M. has always been there for me and has had to give me pep talks like this before. I don't fully accept her words, but I try. I want to. I breathe a bit easier. 5:30 p.m. — It's time to head over to Z.'s house for dinner. I start to question if seeing him again is a good idea and if I'm ready to invest energy into a new person. I tell myself to take things one day at a time, though, and that making new acquaintances is what I need right now. Z. lives a little over a mile away from me in a different area of town, so I decide to drive. 6:30 p.m. — I'd been nervous about coming over, but Z. is so kind and his demeanor puts me at ease. I play with his dog as he cooks dinner and we chat. He serves me sweet potato and black bean tacos garnished with cilantro and avocado. After dinner, we notice the weather has finally let up, and Z. asks if I want to go for a walk in the woods outside his window. After days of feeling quarantined at home, I relish in the idea of being in the woods. 7 p.m. — Wearing our thickest boots, we tromp through snow, ice, and mud behind his dog, who excitedly leads the way. Z. and I share more about our families and our childhoods, bouncing from topic to topic. There isn't a lull in conversation and I can't tell if that's just because we're both so talkative, if it's out of nervousness, or if it's a combination of both. Regardless, talking with him is nice. We wind through the woods and trek across the neighborhood, making a big loop back to his house. 8 p.m. — When we make it back to his driveway, I thank him for the dinner and say we should hang out again soon. My departure probably seems a bit abrupt, but whatever happens next in my life, I want to take it slowly. I'm conscious of my fragility and am trying to take care of my myself. 9 p.m. — When I make it home, I check my phone and see a snow day has been called for work tomorrow. This is the best surprise I can imagine. It's time to make the most of the evening then. After a brief ab workout at home, I draw a bath. I quickly Google household items to add to bath water and get the idea to add a quarter cup of coconut oil. I also add a few drops of lemon and rosemary essential oils. I go all out for this bath – I bring in a book, my Bluetooth speaker, my computer, and half a bottle of wine I opened earlier in the week. I read for a bit, but ultimately decide to turn on Sylvan Esso, slide a bit deeper into the bath, and enjoy the wine. The only thing standing between me and full relaxation is my cat, who – during every bath – thinks I'm in danger and stands on the edge of the tub, alternating between pleading eye contact and hissing at the water.

"8 a.m. — A snow day in spring – who would ever imagine? I decide to get up and make the most of the day. I quickly jump in the shower and make scrambled eggs with toast for breakfast. I make a mental note that I'm stupidly low on groceries. I pack a bag with my computer, a book, student papers, and my wallet, and head out to walk to a café. 9 a.m. — The walk is tedious through the slush, but I get a call from my grandma, who asks if I want to come over for some homemade chicken noodle soup. I say yes. I can't remember the last time my grandma felt well enough to invite me over for lunch. 9:20 a.m. — From my house, I can easily walk to four different cafés, so I rotate where I go. Today, this particular café is relatively empty. I order a turmeric-ginger tea latte and use the time to submit a recent short story of mine to a number of literary publications, which is something I don't usually have time for. I'm pleased to have this extra day to myself and am grateful that I feel relatively positive today. $5.50 12 p.m. — I drive to my grandma's house and find her in the yard throwing old French fries near some robins. She tells me she's feeding them because: ""How are they supposed to find food in this snow?"" We head inside and she nearly force-feeds me bowl after bowl of chicken soup and crusty bread as she presses me with questions on my new house. I try to seem excited about the move. She gives me food to take home, as always. 3 p.m. — I feel inspired to do some downsizing. I go through my closet and find a handful shirts I never wear to give to the counseling office at my school to be given to students who need them. I take a dozen books to drop off at the nearest Little Free Library for someone else to discover. Then I take pictures of wall art I no longer like and post them on the Facebook Marketplace. 5:30 p.m. — I peer inside the Tupperware my grandma gave me and can't tell what is what, but heat it up regardless. I give it a taste and it really is delicious, so I have it for dinner tonight. 7:30 p.m. — After pouring over prices and times, I order my tickets to head out west this summer. $336 for a one-way ticket to San Jose, CA, plus a trip from California to Seattle for $123 to vist my friend. I don't book a flight home just yet. These costs will eventually be reimbursed by the institute I'm participating in, but that check won't come until August. $459 8 p.m. — Last night's bath was enjoyable enough to convince me to do it again tonight. I fill the tub and balance my gin and tonic with cucumber on the ledge as I settle in. This time, I bring my laptop in so I can watch on Hulu. A friend told me it was a funny show, but I find it irrevocably sad. 9:30 p.m. — I search for pajamas on this chilly night and find one of my ex's shirts again. I debate putting it on, questioning if it's the right thing to do. I slide it over my head and crawl into bed. Daily Total: $464.50",4,270
"5 a.m. — I get up to feed my ravenous cat and notice I have to scrape my car off again. Begrudgingly, I proceed to get ready and fill my thermos with peppermint tea to help with my persistent stuffiness and headache. For lunch, I pack more of my pasta leftovers and vow to myself to bring something different tomorrow. I munch on peanut butter toast as I brush my cat, giving her a bit of attention before I leave. 9 a.m. — During my prep hour, I email my principal to express my firm interest in only teaching English next year. Being new to the building, I spent a big chunk of this school year teaching a college-prep class dreaded by staff and students alike. I'm sure my request will be ignored, but I feel better at least verbalizing it. I check online to see if there are any open positions in neighboring districts. 10 a.m. — Z. texts me and asks if I've been to the new poke restaurant in my neighborhood. I text back and start to feel heavy. Hanging out with Z. was fun, but I'm beginning to recognize that I have a lot of healing to do. I make a mental note that I need to express this to Z. sometime this week. I can't keep seeing him and pretending I'm okay. 12 p.m. — Today feels harder than usual. I can't seem to shake the cloud hanging over me. The work hours go by in a blur. I only have a few more hours until I can head home. 3 p.m. — I slump into the couch as soon as I walk in the door. My cat jumps up and joins me in the sun. I remember my grad class meets this upcoming Saturday and I'm behind in my work. I get a lump in my throat and worry about not being prepared, but can't bring myself to work on it right now. I allow myself to rest and cry, but feel guilty as I fall behind in my responsibilities. 6 p.m. — I walk to meet a friend for tacos and a beer. As she talks about her recent work trip, I notice a ring on her finger. She didn't tell me she got engaged. I expect to feel upset, but I don't. I'm glad for her. We order a large appetizer and two tacos apiece. She picks up dinner this time. We head across the street to a brewery and order PB&J ales. I pay for drinks and promise that dinner's on me next time. $10.50 10:30 p.m. — I quickly tidy up the house and throw the ball for my cat before I head to sleep. I feel a bit better than I did earlier, acknowledging that my friends really do care about me. Daily Total: $10.50",5,270
"5 a.m. — I had some terrible dreams, so I've been awake for awhile. I dutifully rise with my alarm and repeat my normal morning routine before work. I'm not hungry, but I force myself to eat. As I eat my cereal, I remember my friend telling me about ashwagandha supplements and how she takes them when she feels overly stressed. I'm skeptical, but do a quick bit of research and order a bottle off of Amazon on a whim. $20 9:30 a.m. — I text a few trusted friends about the therapists they see and how they pay for it. The rave about their experiences and explain they only have a $20 copay. I convince myself it's something I should try. I look into my insurance and discover I'd have to pay my annual deductible of $1,350 before my insurance covers therapy. I'm crushed. I thought teacher's insurance was supposed to be amazing? I never come close to meeting my deductible and begin to feel like therapy isn't a viable option for me. 2:30 p.m. — The work day is over and I rush to volunteering. Once a week, I volunteer at a nonprofit that works with young students on creative writing. 5:15 p.m. — Driving home, I receive a message from my ex saying he'll be stopping over tomorrow to get the last of his things. Suddenly it feels like I can't breathe again. I try to push it out of my mind, but I can't fight off the tears. 6:15 p.m. — I drown out my thoughts with episodes of on Netflix. For dinner, I rummage through my freezer and find homemade egg rolls. I look at the Budget Bytes recipe again for directions on reheating and pop them in the oven. As I watch Netflix and eat dinner, I pack a few boxes of items in the living room, feeling numb to reality. 7:30 p.m. — My close friend invites me over and I quickly accept the invitation. I can't stand being home anymore. We don't do much of anything, but I'm fine with that. 9:30 p.m. — I'm back home and head to sleep. My mind runs rampant with dreams all night.

"5 a.m. — Today's the day I've been dreading for a long time. I get ready for work in a daze: I do all of my normal things (shower, make tea, pack lunch), but don't really notice I'm doing them. I make an egg-in-a-basket for breakfast, but barely eat any of it. I pick off pieces of the egg and feed it to my cat who's meowing next to me. She seems to live for moments like these. 6:30 a.m. — I'm at work and I get a text from Z.: “Your week going well?” He's trying to be nice and make conversation. I figure this is when I should tell him how I'm really feeling. I draft a text to send to Z. I briefly explain that I'm in a rough place emotionally right now and need to figure out who I am and what I want now that I'm in this position of being newly single for the first time in my adult life. I state that I need to invest in myself before I can invest in others. I tell him he's very enjoyable to be around and if we continue to hang out, it'll need to be just as friends, not as potential partners. I hit send. 11 a.m. — My new lease is emailed to me. I read through it carefully while my students are busy. I still can't get over the pet fee being $50 per month with a (refundable) $400 pet security deposit. 3:30 p.m. — This is the last time my ex and I will be together at our house. We both cry, embrace, and tell each other happy memories that pass through our minds. We're trying so hard to end this on the best note we can. He packs his car with the rest of his things. We have one last kiss on the porch. We don't say goodbye. 5:30 p.m. — A friend of mine pulls up into the driveway to pick me up. She's taking me to a poetry reading to help get my mind off things. After the event, we head to the cocktail bar by my house and order drinks. I pick up the tab. $25 11 p.m. — As I crawl into bed, I mull over everything that's happening, but am too tired to dig that deeply. I tell myself to take things one day at a time and drift off to sleep. Daily Total: $25",7,270
"6 a.m. — Wake up after snoozing several times. I had intended to do morning yoga at home with a YouTube video, but I opted for a hearty breakfast of eggs and avocado instead of downward dog. I do my hair and makeup and pack my lunch for work – roasted eggplant, zucchini, and onion with leftover rice and shredded chicken, plus my favorite drink, pineapple-flavored seltzer water. Lunch, done. 7 a.m. — 15 minute commute to work. I work for a nonprofit with a lax schedule, so I'm one of the first people on my floor to arrive. I fire up Outlook and start responding to vendor emails. 11:30 a.m. — I finish my morning meetings and reheat my lunch in the microwave. I want to go outside for a walk, but it's raining. I settle on eating at my desk and browsing Reddit. 3:30 p.m. — I leave work a little early to make my therapy appointment. I used to see my psychologist twice a week, but I've tapered that down to once every two to three weeks now that my parents aren't paying for it anymore and I have a high-deductible health plan. I've worked with this psychologist for eight years now, and talking to her is a priceless comfort. 4:45 p.m. — My therapy appointment is over. I feel drained but also lighthearted. We talked about my anxieties related to my face and body tremors, plus my dreams and fears related to having children. The medication I take is harmful to fetuses, and people with serious mental illnesses have a hard time – impossible, really – getting approved to adopt. My medication makes a normal life possible for me, but I've always wanted kids. It's been on my mind for the past few months, especially since my boyfriend of four years also wants kids. Google tells me that surrogates cost about $100,000-ish, which is a lot less than I would have expected. If I decide I want to have a child when I'm 35, which is in ten years, then I would need to save $10,000 per year starting now. 6 p.m. — I work from home a little to make up for the time I spent in therapy. Then I microwave a frozen meal for dinner. 8 p.m. — My boyfriend and I watch an episode of . He downloads the show online for free somehow. We already used the free month HBO offers to new subscribers on the HBO Now app, and we're both too cheap to pay the 15 bucks a month. I feel bad and resolve to start paying for HBO when starts up again in 2019. Daily Total: $0",1,271
"5:30 a.m. — Wake up on the first alarm. I groggily put on Spandex and a T-shirt and drive to the gym. I lift on Mondays, Wednesday, and Fridays with a coworker, who is quickly becoming a friend. Today is leg day. We do deadlifts, squats, lunges, calf raises, and hip thrusts. 6:45 a.m. — Leave the gym, go home, and contemplate showering. I decide not to, and instead use baby wipes, deodorant, and dry shampoo. 8 a.m. — Arrive at work. It's been a goal of mine to bring my lunch four days a week. On Sunday I tried making shakshuka from a popular recipe that popped up on my Facebook feed. I plan to eat it for two lunches this week, and today is one of them. 11:30 a.m. — Emerge from meeting. My tremors have been getting worse lately, and I don't know why. The antipsychotic drugs I take for my schizophrenia have caused me to develop something called tardive dyskinesia, which, for me, manifests as facial grimacing and hand tremors. It's not terribly noticeable, but I told my coworkers I have Tourette's to explain away the tics. 12:30 a.m. — Eat lunch. This shakshuka is delicious! 5 p.m. — Leave work and head home. I put a few chicken breasts into the slow cooker every Sunday so I can have shredded chicken in the fridge for quick salads and tacos throughout the week. I microwave chicken mixed with cheese and heat up a couple taco shells in a skillet. I add salsa, rice, and the other half of the avocado that I opened up in the morning. Voila – dinner in seven minutes! 6 p.m. — My boyfriend gets home from work. We usually spend an hour after work talking and cuddling on the couch. He tells me about the mystery thief in his office who has been stealing lunches from the break room, and I tell him about my presentation at work that went well. 7 p.m. — I head to the salon down the street to get a haircut. I see a junior stylist, which is considerably cheaper than getting a cut from the more experienced hairdressers at the salon. It's only 30 bucks for a cut, and I tip 20% as usual. My bangs come out a little wonky (they always do, no matter where I go) and I gingerly fix them in the bathroom with kitchen shears when I get home. My DIY bangs situation unsurprisingly doesn't work out, and I resign myself to bobby pins and head bands for the next couple of weeks. $36 Daily Total: $36",2,271
"7 a.m. — Wake up and make a quick breakfast of egg whites, avocado, leftover rice, and Sriracha. I make a large cup of coffee in my Keurig, which is more expensive and environmentally wasteful than a regular coffee pot, but the convenience factor is unbeatable. 11 a.m. — One of my 2018 resolutions is to donate to a different charity every month. I try to give about $20, which definitely isn't a lot (and I know I can do more…), but it's the number I settled on. I try to pick local charities instead national ones. Someone left a flyer in the break room for my city's youth robotics team, which is raising money so they can go to an international competition. I hop onto their GoFundMe page and contribute 20 bucks. $20 5 p.m. — I pick up my boyfriend from work. He usually takes the bus, but it's raining today so I offered to pick him up. We're home by 5:15 and decide to make beef strips and peppers with pasta for dinner. 7 p.m. — We're done with dinner, and to my dismay, we're out of coffee creamer, soy sauce, eggs, and a few other kitchen staples. We decide to go to Kroger. I pick up a few different sauces (sriracha mayo and sweet chili sauce!) for a roasted bang bang cauliflower recipe I've been wanting to try. I also get other food stalwarts like onion, peppers, kale, rice, chicken, limes, and my current obsession: Halo Top. $45 8 p.m. — I head to the gym and do an easy workout on the elliptical. I'm lifting tomorrow, so I don't overdo it. 9 p.m. — I take my evening medication. It makes me super drowsy, so I'm asleep within 10 minutes. Daily Total: $65",3,271
"8 a.m. — I wake up and head to my psychiatrist's office. I've been seeing her since I was 18, and she's the best psychiatrist I've ever been to. She's fee-only (no insurance), but completely worth the $200 per visit. I usually see her once every three months, but my symptoms have been flaring up and I want to try a different medication. We discuss some of the newer anti-psychotics on the market. I called three pharmacies beforehand to get price quotes on them with my insurance, and the most expensive came out to be over $500 per month. She tells me there are chemically similar meds on the market that are older and cheaper. She writes me a script, and I head to CVS to drop it off. $200 9 a.m. — I head to work late because of my appointment. 12 p.m. — I eat my packed lunch – another salad. I added roasted veggies and rice I had in the fridge, so it's not half bad. Then I browse Airbnb for places to stay in London. My boyfriend and I are going to the U.K. in a few weeks and we haven't done any planning yet. 5:30 p.m. — I'm finished with work. One of my friends and I make an effort to go on long walks together a couple times a week, which we do today. She's a little older than me, and is hoping to get married in the next couple years. She's been with her boyfriend for seven years, but he keeps telling her he's not ready for marriage yet. I'm better friends with her boyfriend, so I tread carefully while she unpacks her feelings about the subject. 8 p.m. — I read my book, , for about an hour. Then I do my skincare routine. I'm a little beauty product-obsessed. My best tip for saving money and having great skin is at-home acid peels. Obviously not for everyone, but my skin is very hardy and loves chemical exfoliation. I buy bottles of chemical peels for 20 bucks and they last an entire year of twice weekly sessions. Daily Total: $200",4,271
"7 a.m. — I decide to walk to work today. It's about two and a half miles away, so it's a bit of a hike. The route is pleasant, though. I cross a few parks and spend most of the way on walking and bike trails. 8 a.m. — I arrive at work a little sweaty, so I wipe down in the shower area with a towel before heading upstairs to my desk. 6 p.m. — I go to a local place to get my oil changed. I know nothing about cars, but the garage people always tell me I need full synthetic oil, whatever that means. $90 7 p.m. — Oil change complete. I get gas. Since my commute is so short, I only need to fill up once every three to four weeks. $25 8 p.m. — I FaceTime my parents. My obsessed-with-running mom tries to encourage/harass me into doing a half marathon with her in a few months. I've had persistent shin splints for a while now, so I rebuff her efforts. My parents are really into this thing called FIRE (Financial Independence, Retire Early). I don't know much about it other than people who subscribe to the ideology try to save a significant amount of money in a strategic way to retire before 65. As a result, my dad regularly checks up on me by asking me how much I've contributed to my Roth IRA. It's his way of showing that he cares. I tell him I'm at $4,500. I had a $3,500 tax return this year, so I put all of it into my Roth and another $1,000 I had saved up. He is pleased with my answer, but tells me I can always do better. Ahhhh, Chinese parents – gotta love them! Daily Total: $115",5,271
"8 a.m. — It's my friend's birthday tonight, and he texts me and my boyfriend inviting us to go out for drinks to celebrate. I reply that we'll be there. 9 a.m. — I swing by my gym buddy's house and pick her up. We live about half a mile away from each other, so we carpool whenever we can. 10:30 a.m. — Workout is done, and I'm exhausted. We did arms and abs today. On the bright side, I increased my bench PR! Yay, me! 12 p.m. — I make fried rice for lunch. My boyfriend gets home from his run, and we chill on the couch for a bit, just talking. We're trying to decide if we want to stop in Amsterdam or Paris when we're in Europe next month. I went to Paris about six months ago, and I've never been to Amsterdam, but my boyfriend is more interested in Paris. We discuss the pros and cons of each. 5 p.m. — Dinner! We decide to make baked ziti for dinner and have red velvet Halo Top for dessert. It's a feast! 8 p.m. — I get ready to go out. I settle on a dress and a denim jacket. 10 p.m. — I only let myself have one drink tonight, because alcohol doesn't mix well with my meds. I used to be more lax about drinking and would sometimes have over five drinks in a night, but last month I made the conscious effort to reduce my consumption. It's helped my schizophrenia symptoms considerably, so I'm happy with the compromise. $5 2 a.m. — My boyfriend and I stay up talking about the night. He's got a little bit of social anxiety so he usually unpacks his feelings after big social events for a bit when we get home. I listen to him for a while and we eventually fall asleep. Daily Total: $5",6,271
"10 a.m. — I wake up and my boyfriend and he makes us French toast for breakfast. We lay around on the couch talking and do more planning for our trip to Europe. 2:30 p.m. — I go to the local library. The book club I'm in picked out next month's book, and the library has one copy left! I schlep myself on my bike to the library and pick up the book, along with a couple others. 6 p.m. — I am super engrossed in . I know my book club is a couple years late on this one! It's a really gripping page-turner. I check the clock and I can't believe I've been reading for a couple hours! 8 p.m. — My boyfriend and I head to our friends' place for TV night, which they host once a week. We bring a bottle of wine and chips we already had at home. Daily Total: $0",7,271
"6 a.m. — I get up with the alarm and eat the granola bar on my bedside table before even getting out of bed. I'm just transitioning into my second trimester of pregnancy and the nausea hasn't let up yet. I've found that eating small meals throughout the day helps keep my energy up (“up” is relative) and prevents some of the nausea. I let our dog out and she happily stays in the backyard while I shower and get ready for my day. Then I answer emails and bill my time from the previous week from my home office in order to let the dog stay outside a little longer. Usually I don't worry about our dog in the mornings because my husband works from home and takes care of her, but he's out of town today, so the morning routine is on me. This means I leave for work later than usual. I would stay and work from home during the morning, but I have a flight to catch at 1 p.m. and several team meetings before that. I'm out the door by 7:30. 8 a.m. — I arrive at the office and get to work immediately. I eat a packet of instant oatmeal and take my prenatal vitamins. I also drink as much water as I can throughout the day, keeping a water bottle at my desk and refilling it several times. I used to drink about three cups of coffee a day (lawyer life), but pregnancy put a stop to that. By 11, I'm finished with my last team call and I'm on my way to the airport. 11:30 a.m. — I arrive at the airport and park in the lot. My husband's flight lands in a few hours and he'll pick up the car to drive it home. $20 11:50 a.m. — After I'm through security (thank you TSA Precheck), I grab a chicken burrito bowl with extra veggies from Qdoba and get as much work done as I can before boarding my flight. I also get a soda, which is out of character for me, but I want a small caffeine boost. ($14.92 expensed) 1 p.m. — On my flight to New York, I pay the ridiculous $34 for internet because time is money and I can't afford to be out of communication for five hours. The flight comes with “lunch” (a.k.a. a snack) and I choose the cheese plate. It's actually a perfect pregnancy snack – hard cheese, crackers, apple slices, grapes, and almonds. ($34 expensed) 9:30 p.m. — Arrive in New York at 9:30 p.m., thanks to the time difference, and hop in a Lyft to my hotel. ($60.10 expensed) 10:30 p.m. — I'm finally at my hotel and stop by the Duane Reade next door to buy a thumb drive (I can't believe I left mine on my desk at work), the salad that least looks like it'll kill me, a Kind bar, and instant oatmeal. Then I get back to work out of my hotel room while I eat the salad (without a fork, because I forgot to buy one) and half of the Kind bar, and take my prenatal vitamins. I'm not a late-night person, and I need sleep before my deposition tomorrow, so I take my anti-nausea medication and crash at 1:15 a.m. I read a few pages of a book on my Kindle before bed – it calms my mind and helps me stop worrying about work. ($33 expensed) Daily Total: $20",1,272
"5 a.m. — I'm rudely woken up by my own alarm. I don't even want to think about what time it is at home. I've been traveling so much lately that I'm not really on a time zone at this point anyway. I eat the second half of the Kind bar that I saved from last night, take my nausea medication, and snooze for about 10 minutes. (Snoozing isn't normal for me, but I've been more tired lately, thanks to growing a human child in my body.) Then I get out of bed and answer emails before hopping in the shower. While I shower, I let the steam de-wrinkle my suit. I eat two packets of oatmeal, take my prenatal vitamins, and drink of cup of decaf coffee while I finish prepping for my deposition. At some point, my stomach decides that decaf coffee is not cool and I promptly throw up everything I've just eaten. 8:30 a.m. — Makeup and hair done, suit on, deposition outline printed (thanks hotel business center), and I'm out the door. I grab a banana from a bowl of fruit on my way out of the hotel to save for later. I walk to the opposing counsel's office, since it's a relatively nice 40 degree morning in New York. It's only half a mile away, and a walk in the fresh air is much better for my nausea than a taxi ride. 9 a.m. — Deposition time. Opposing counsel provides lunch. I eat salad and a veggie sandwich, even though I would much prefer turkey, but I can't have deli meat. I grab a cookie too, to round out the meal. Since I haven't gotten to sleep much, I drink a cup of coffee during the deposition. (I take the 200 milligram rule very seriously!) 3:15 p.m. — I'm on my way to the airport. Halfway through the deposition I had my secretary get me on a later flight because the deposition was going longer than expected. The only flight she could book was three hours later and now I have time to kill. I would rather get to the airport and set up shop so I can work from there than spend time commuting to my company's New York office. During the car ride I have a call with one of our experts for the case. I try to keep my downtime as minimal as possible. Once I arrive at the airport, I send a couple of urgent emails before I even have a chance to go through security. ($83 expensed) 4:45 p.m. — I see that there's an earlier flight home on the same airline, so I go to the gate and request to be put on standby. There are only middle seats left, but that's completely worth it to me. And there is no change fee, so I'm not costing the firm anything. A large storm is coming into New York tonight and I want to get out of here ASAP. I work at the gate while waiting for the flight. 6 p.m. — I make it onto the earlier flight! I also keep getting alerts that my later flight is delayed due to weather, and I'm very happy I got to the airport early and asked to switch. I do regret not having the chance to grab food in the airport, but I eat the banana I hoarded as I line up to board the flight. Once on the plane, the $18.99 airline wifi is atrocious, and my emails keep getting stuck in my outbox. I can't connect to my VPN, so I do as much work as I can without having access to my firm network. It's painful to be on a five and a half hour flight and be disconnected from my team. ($18.99 expensed) 7 p.m. — I order a snack box with hummus, almonds, and crackers on the flight. ($9.95 expensed) 9:20 p.m. — I answer a few emails at the airport that I didn't get while on the plane and grab a Starbucks breakfast sandwich to eat on my way out. I would normally just wait until I get home to eat, but lack of food leads to nausea. ($4.63 expensed) 10 p.m. — I make it home after an entirely too-chatty Lyft ride. I'll still tip and give her 5 stars, but I did not need to know about her Tinder experiences. I crash into bed with my husband after sending a couple of emails and taking my prenatal vitamins and nausea medication. I'm so happy to be home. ($48 expensed) Daily Total: $0",2,272
"6 a.m. — My alarm is not my friend today. I snuggle with my husband for 10 minutes because I haven't seen him in five days. I wish I could sleep in and have him make me breakfast, but no rest for the weary. Before dragging myself out of bed, I take my nausea medication. Then I finally get up to shower and get ready for work while eating half a granola bar. I listen to a podcast while getting ready. I also spend a little time with our cat, who has been unhappy with all my travel. 7 a.m. — Out the door. I buy a bagel on my way to work because oatmeal does not sound appetizing. I'm in the office and working by 7:30 a.m. I take my prenatal vitamins – I keep a bottle at the office and a bottle at home because I take them in the morning and at night with food. $2.95 9:30 a.m. — I break down and drink a half-decaf, half-regular coffee from the office machine. A meeting was cancelled, so we have bagels and muffins in the kitchen. I grab half a muffin because I'm already hungry. I should have had protein this morning rather than just carbs to keep me full longer. 11:30 a.m. — I take half an hour to run to Mendocino Farms to pick up a salad and a side of spicy potato salad for lunch. I'll eat half of the potato salad and save the rest for an afternoon snack. The food is way overpriced there, but I haven't spent much money this week, so I splurge a little for the convenience factor. I'm so impressed by people who meal prep and bring their lunches to work. I'm lucky if I remember to bring leftovers from whatever my husband prepared for dinner the night before. I eat the salad at my desk as I get back to billing. $16.95 1:30 p.m. — Time for a coffee nap. Half-caffeinated coffee followed by 15 minutes laying on a yoga mat in my office. It takes about that long for the caffeine to hit my system, and in the meantime I can relax my body and my mind. 2:30 p.m. — I eat the second half of my potato salad while working. 4 p.m. — One of the secretaries gives me an apple from her backyard for a snack. She's so sweet and always shares her fresh fruit. 5:10 p.m. — I make the horrendous mistake of going to the pharmacy to pick up my nausea prescription ($40) right around the time most people get off work. It should take 20 minutes, and instead takes 40. I grab milk and a few apples while I'm there to keep at the office ($4.78). $44.78 7 p.m. — I make a green shake to eat at my desk while working. My work is never-ending and I'm uncomfortable in the pencil skirt I wore to work, so I decide to drive home at 7:15 and finish working from my home office. 7:40 p.m. — I'm back to billing from the comfort of my home, wearing pajamas as my husband makes turkey tacos. My husband typically does the grocery shopping and the majority of the cooking because he works from home. Back when we only had one car, I took on the grocery responsibilities, but I finally leased my car after four years of living in California. It's a splurge (my family thinks a car is “new” if it's less than 10 years old), but I love it, and my husband was going stir crazy in San Diego without a dedicated car of his own. I take a quick break from work to watch TV with my husband on the couch. is so good. Then I work from the home office until 2 a.m. Daily Total: $64.68",3,272
"6 a.m. — Up with my alarm. I would sleep in, but I have a 6:30 a.m. call with people on the East Coast and no time to lose today. I take a quick shower and am logged onto my computer in the home office by 6:25. I eat a couple of pieces of Hawaiian bread while taking my call. It isn't a real breakfast, but hopefully it'll stave off my hunger-induced nausea. 7:10 a.m. — I take nausea medication and make a quick scramble of eggs, spinach, leftover turkey meat, and cheese while getting ready for work. It's an unusual combination, but I need the protein and my iron levels have been low despite the prenatal vitamins. I spend the extra two minutes putting on under-eye concealer (not part of my typical makeup routine) because I look like death today from the lack of sleep. 8 a.m. — I'm out the door an hour later than normal, so traffic is heavy. I get into the office at 8:30, grab a half-caf coffee from the office machine, and immediately get to work. I have another call in half an hour. I eat a banana I brought from home after the call. 11:45 a.m. — I take a half hour break to get a shrimp bowl from Rubio's. I eat it at my desk while working. $10.29 3 p.m. — After a midday filing I need a little pick-me-up, so I drive to Starbucks and get a chai latte. I get an extra one for the secretary who has been busting her butt for us on this case. Sometimes after a particularly brutal midnight filing I'll give each of the secretaries a bottle of wine as a thank you. They aren't compensated nearly as well as attorneys and they have to deal with high-stress situations all the time. $9.20 4:30 p.m. — I eat an apple with a sizable portion of Nutella, which I keep in a dedicated food drawer in my desk for days like today. 6 p.m. — My brain is no longer working and I have more work to do, so I head home to switch into comfortable clothes and work from there. I pick up Thai food for dinner (since my husband is out watching basketball with friends) and take a break watching trashy TV while I eat. I'm back to working by 8 p.m. $19.50 9:30 p.m. — I can only stay focused until about 9:30, so I take my nausea medication, eat half a granola bar, and quit for the night. My husband gets home about the time I'm slipping into bed with a book and we chat for a bit while I fall asleep. He knows I'm exhausted and doesn't try to keep me up too long, but it's good to spend time with him during this crazy week. Daily Total: $38.99",4,272
"5 a.m. — I wake up an hour earlier than normal because I didn't get nearly as much done as I needed to last night. I'm working by 5:20, but unfortunately another fire drill pops up for the case that has been monopolizing my time, and I have to shift focus to that from the case I was planning to work on. While working, I make avocado toast for breakfast with an avocado from the tree in my backyard. One of the many reasons I love living in Southern California. Then I take a quick shower and switch over to working on another case. 7 a.m. — So much for the avocado toast. I forgot to take the nausea medication this morning and now I really regret that. I lay back in bed for about 20 minutes to feel better after throwing up breakfast. Then I eat a banana and get back to work. 10:30 a.m. — I take a 10-minute break to eat an apple and hang out in the backyard with my husband and our dog. We bought a tiny house on a large lot (large for San Diego) and the backyard is my happy place. 11:30 a.m. — I eat my leftover Thai food for lunch while working. By noon, I'm exhausted, so I lay down for 45 minutes before we have to go to our ultrasound. Work can wait for a bit. 12:45 p.m. — My husband and I drive to the ultrasound separately because I need to go into the office afterwards. Ultrasounds are amazing. Our little girl is only three inches long, and yet we can see her stubby little fingers and toes and hear her heartbeat! Everything looks good, which is a relief because I've been feeling so awful lately. We get a couple copies of the best print-out to give to our parents. There is no copay at the appointment – thanks, insurance! 2 p.m. — I pick up a Crunchwrap from Taco Bell on my drive into work. Yes, I love Taco Bell. And yes, as a native Southern Californian I am aware that it is not ""real Mexican food.” I also happen to love real Mexican food, but sometimes a girl's gotta eat a Crunchwrap with about five packets of that Taco Bell hot sauce. I work at the office for the afternoon. I head out at 6:30 p.m.,  knowing I have more work to do, but I plan to finish up working at the kitchen counter while hanging out with my husband. $3.95 7 p.m. — I work while my husband grills chicken and makes baked potatoes. After dinner, we watch NCAA basketball until I'm about ready to pass out at 10. Daily Total: $3.95",5,272
"7:30 a.m. — I wake up and answer emails on my phone while lazing in bed. At around 9, my husband makes chorizo breakfast burritos while I work. I add avocado and tomato from our garden to my burrito. After breakfast, my husband and I sit outside to enjoy the nice weather. This turns into me falling asleep on the outdoor couch for a nice half-hour nap. 12:30 — I take the dog on her favorite hike close by our house. I haven't had a chance to work out all week and I know I'm supposed to stay active during pregnancy. After the hike my husband makes chicken Caesar wraps with the leftover grilled chicken while I (surprise!) work. And then our neighbors stop by to drop off fresh eggs from their chickens! I plan to make lemon bars for them using lemons from our backyard as a thank you. 2 p.m. — My husband and I go down our little beach town's main street to walk around. I buy two wrap dresses from a local boutique that will fit as my belly grows. $158 3 p.m. — We stop by our favorite bar to watch NCAA basketball. He has two beers and I have a root beer. $20 4:30 — I need a snack, so I buy toast with hummus, lemon, olive oil, arugula, and cucumbers from a café nearby. $5.50 5 p.m. — Some friends invite us over for dinner of tri-tip, roasted homegrown root vegetables, and sweet potatoes. Absolutely delicious! And I get to tell them about the baby, which is very fun. 8:30 p.m. — Our friends are going to a show at a local music venue, which we were also supposed to attend, but we waited too long to buy tickets and now it's sold out. (I'm not-so-secretly happy not to be going to the show, because I am absolutely exhausted.) We drive home while they Uber to the venue. Once our friends get there, they find someone selling a ticket and buy it for my husband, so I get back in the car and drop him off at the venue. (He pays them back, $30.) With work and the pregnancy, I haven't been up for staying out late, so I'm glad when my husband goes out without me. I get home at 9:30 and crash immediately. $30 Daily Total: $213.50",6,272
"7:30 a.m. — I'm awake and answering emails. I plan on being lazy today; watching Netflix while working. I remember to take my nausea medication right when I wake up, and eat a Hawaiian roll to keep my stomach happy. 8:30 a.m. — I eat a banana and a couple of pieces of toast while watching on Netflix and working. At noon I can no longer keep my eyes open, so I take a nap. I sleep until 1:30, which is longer than I meant to sleep, but after this week, I think my body needs it. I wake up to several urgent emails and get back to work. 3 p.m. — I need ingredients for the lemon bars, so I head to the grocery store. Buy Buy Baby is in the same complex and my mother and sister have been hounding me to look into baby registries, so I walk through and get immediately overwhelmed. That place is a nightmare. I'll be doing all of my baby shopping online, thanks. At the grocery store I get powdered sugar and baking powder, plus everything else we need for the week: milk, chicken, cucumbers, romaine lettuce, carrots, potatoes, mixed greens, ground turkey, tortillas, cheese, bread, pickles, veggie burgers, and ham. It's amazing how inexpensive groceries can be when you aren't buying any wine. $86 5 p.m. — My husband picks lemons from our tree and juices them for me as I prepare the crust for the lemon bars. I love baking, but I love it even more when someone else does the hard part like juice a million tiny lemons for lemon bars or peel apples for a pie. I finish up baking the lemon bars but they need to set before I can arrange them. By the time they set, it's too late to bring over to the neighbors (they have little kids who go to bed early), so I'll have my husband run them over tomorrow while I'm at work. While I bake, my husband brings in the mail. One of my best friends from college sent me a hilarious card and a onesie from our favorite podcast – ! I text her immediately to tell her how much I look forward to putting our little girl in the “Sweet Baby Angel” onesie. 7 p.m. — My husband cooks peanut chicken while I work. Then we snuggle on the couch and watch the new episode of followed by on Netflix and then on HBO. I'm not sold on , but I'm immediately into . By 10:30 p.m., the Sunday scaries have officially set in and I'm not looking forward to another busy week. But at least this time I won't have to jet off to the other side of the country (that I know of). Time for sleep. Daily Total: $86",7,272
"6:30 a.m. — I wake up, feed my dogs, and get ready for work. My husband worked all weekend, so he's off today and still asleep. I was gone for the holiday weekend, and my flight didn't get in until 10 last night, so I haven't seen much of him. He wakes up before I leave, so we talk for a few minutes before I rush out the door. I grab a Larabar and a LaCroix on my way out but plan to come home for lunch. 7:30 a.m. — Traffic seems worse than usual today, but I swing by Smoothie King for a smoothie on the way and still make it to my desk by 7:45. I'm normally on calls from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m. on Mondays, but my first two calls are cancelled today. I'm thankful because I can really use the extra time to get work done. $5.94 12:30 p.m. — This morning has flown by, and I've had no time to prep for a big meeting this afternoon, so I nix my plan to run home for lunch and grab a pre-made salad from our cafeteria instead. I pop in my headphones for true crime podcast adventures and get to work on spreadsheets. $6.48 3:15 p.m. — I'm finally done with my meetings for the day and can sit and focus on my work. I still have a ton of work to do and I'm hoping to get out of here on time, so I grab a package of cheese crackers out of the community snack basket and try to get work knocked out. 5:45 p.m. — I leave work, unfortunately too late to make my workout class, so I just head home. I spend time unwinding on the couch with my husband, D., watching I'm normally really good about meal planning and shopping on the weekends, but since I was out of town this weekend, I'm feeling way behind. I microwave a sweet potato and eat it with leftover chicken and avocado and figure out what we're going to eat the rest of the week. 8 p.m. — Grocery list in hand, I make my way to Aldi. I don't usually buy meat at Aldi, but I like their produce and pantry staples, and it's less than 10 minutes from my house. We have a second fridge/freezer in our garage, so I like to stock up on protein when it's on sale. I buy avocados, grapes, broccoli crowns, strawberries, blackberries, bell peppers, celery, dried fruit, sweet potatoes, bananas, two 15-packs of berry LaCroix, oatmeal, and two pints of Blue Bell ice cream. We try to eat paleo at home about 80% of the time, so most of what I buy fits into that lifestyle, but sometimes a girl just needs ice cream. $35.32 8:45 p.m. — After Aldi, I run next door to Target to buy four boxes of Kleenex (it's allergy time in Texas, y'all), cold brew coffee concentrate for D., and two packages of sparkling water. I impulse buy a Target “Beauty Box” on the way out because, Treat Yo'self ($7). I pay with my Red Cart to get 5% off. $26.51 9:30 p.m. — Once I get home and put away the groceries, I get ready for bed, watch a few episodes of on Hulu, play with the dogs, and then go to sleep at about 10:30. Daily Total: $74.25",1,273
"6:15 a.m. — I'm up before my alarm, but there's no point in going back to sleep, so I get up and feed the dogs, take the trash out, and make myself a lunch. I know today will be a busy day at work again, so I'm not in a huge rush to get moving. I make myself a fancy breakfast of two rice cakes with almond butter and eat it while I get a head start on emails for the day. 8:15 a.m. — I roll into the office and start working through emails and accounting entries for the end of the month while I catch up on episodes of . 10 a.m. — My boss sends a reminder about the baby shower we're hosting for a coworker next week, and I volunteer to order the cake. This also reminds me I need to get a gift, so I buy a Boppy pillow from her registry. Thankfully, I remember I still have a Bed Bath & Beyond gift card from our wedding two years ago, and it covers the pillow ($42.14), with $35 left over. 11:45 a.m. — I come to a good stopping point on my work, so I take advantage of the break and eat my lunch: a salad I made with spring mix, beets, goat cheese, walnuts, jicama, and leftover chicken. It's delicious. Seems like all my coworkers have left for lunch, so I have quiet time to myself. I talk to a friend for a few minutes and catch up on personal emails before getting back to work. 4:45 p.m. — I am pretty much finished with work for the day, but I'm going straight from here to a meeting, so I spend a little bit of time finishing up my meal plan for the next 10 days or so and looking at flights on the Qantas website. We're going to Australia later this year and have booked our flights there and back, but still have in-country flights to book. I don't book anything now, but might later tonight after talking to D. 5:45 p.m. — I'm a few minutes early for this meeting, and I'm hungry, but the only thing around is a Sonic, so I stop for tater tots and a cherry limeade. $4.35 8:15 p.m. — I get home from the meeting and graze on some fruit. D is busy doing homework, so I hang with the dogs and watch a few episodes of before bed at 10:30. Daily Total: $4.35",2,273
"6 a.m. — D. left for work shortly after 5 a.m., so the dogs are up and looking for breakfast. I feed them and try to go back to sleep, which is a bust. I get up and eat cereal with lactose-free milk and get ready for work. I have a dentist appointment this morning, so I brush and floss super well to try to trick them into thinking I've been keeping up with my flossing. 7:45 a.m. — Our dry cleaner is next to the dentist, so I stop in and pick up the clothes D. dropped off on Monday. A half dozen of his work shirts, a few pairs of pants, and two of my sweaters. We get a 20% off discount through my company. $37.75 9 a.m. — I'm done at the dentist, but unfortunately need to get a filling replaced. My insurance covers all of today's visit except an extra fluoride treatment ($27.65), but I prepay part of the filling cost ($58.93). I make an appointment to come back in two weeks, and I'm at my desk ready to work 10 minutes later. $86.58 11:30 p.m. — D. and I confirm our Australia itinerary over IM, so I go ahead and book the flights ($1,435.83 for three flights each). Qantas gives me a $30-off voucher for a hotel as a thank you. We've already booked most of our hotels using points, but we still have one night to go, so I go ahead and book our one night in Alice Springs ($91.42). $1,527.25 1:30 p.m. — I haven't eaten since the cereal this morning, so I leave for lunch. I usually eat at my desk or go home for lunch, but once a week I go to the south side of town to get allergy shots at my doctor's office and usually treat myself to lunch somewhere I might not normally go around there. Today I go to a gyro spot that I haven't been to in a few months and get a gyro salad and an apple fritter ($10.45). Since they're close to closing, the woman gives me two fritters for the price of one. I eat my salad and part of one of the fritters before getting my shots. The shots are around $13 out of pocket each week, but I only pay the bill every six weeks or so, and I just paid last week, so no charge today. $10.45 2:45 p.m. — I'm back at my desk and back to work. My one afternoon meeting got cancelled, so it'll be spreadsheets and accounting straight through until 5 p.m. 5:30 p.m. — My Jazzercise studio just added a new Wednesday night class, which I'm really excited about. I like to go three to four times a week, but with random meetings and stuff in the evenings, it makes it hard. A lot of people laugh when I tell them about Jazzercise, but I've been doing it for two years and I love it. It's a super supportive environment with women of all ages and body types, and I always get a great workout. My monthly membership takes care of tonight's class. 7 p.m. — I'm home later than usual, and D. has already eaten random snacks for dinner. I planned to make one of my favorite Nom Nom Paleo recipes tonight, but it feels like too much effort, so I just cook hamburger with taco seasoning, mix in salsa, and eat it with chopped tomato, avocado, and jicama. I take stir-fry meat and chicken thighs out of the freezer to thaw for our next few dinners, clean up the kitchen, and talk to D. about Australia activities we've been researching. 8:45 p.m. — I shower and do my bedtime routine early so I can get out of our bathroom and D. can go to bed, since he'll be getting up super early again. My skin is starting to calm down after a rough couple weeks of breakouts, and I do a clay mask to help it along. Then I say goodnight to D. before I retreat to the living room to half-watch old episodes of while I read this month's novel for my book club. With murders solved and the first few chapters read, I go to bed at 11 p.m. Daily Total: $1,662.03",3,273
"6:30 a.m. — I wake up before my alarm again, but this time by only a few minutes. I woke up way too early this morning when D.'s alarm went off, but fortunately went back to sleep pretty quickly. I get up, feed the dogs, and get ready for work. I slept with my hair wet last night, so it takes extra wrangling this morning to look half normal. I'm out the door by 7:30. 7:50 a.m. — I chat with a coworker before our meeting starts. I eat the second fritter from yesterday with a LaCroix I brought from home while going through emails and getting ready for the day. 11:15 a.m. — I go home for lunch and D. is there too, but has already eaten. I microwave a potato and put some of the taco meat from yesterday on it with ghee and avocado. It's super nice today, so I sit out back with the dogs and let them run around for a while before I go back to work. 4:45 p.m. — It's been a pretty standard afternoon, and now it's time to go to Jazzercise. I eat a banana for a little pre-workout fuel, and I'm out the door. 5:10 p.m. — I get horrible stomach cramps on the way to Jazzercise and think about bowing out. I have Crohn's disease, and sometimes my digestive system just doesn't feel like cooperating with my life. I pop a couple of pills, hope for the best, and manage to power through class. 6:45 p.m. — I get home from class and start dinner. I make an easy broccoli and beef stir-fry and serve it with cauliflower rice. D. cleans up the kitchen for me while I shower and putter around the house. 9 p.m. — My back is hurting, so I lay on my acupressure mat for a while and try to stretch things out while D. and I watch . The mustache on the husband of this couple is insane. We check Twitter for the best reactions and crack up at some of the comments. 10 p.m. — D. goes to bed, and I watch an episode and a half of before going to bed. Daily Total: $0",4,273
"6:30 a.m. — I actually sleep until my alarm goes off today! I have conference calls starting at 8, so I'm out the door before 7:30. 7:40 a.m. — I get to work and find out that one of my early calls is cancelled, so that's one less thing to worry about! 10:30 a.m. — I'm already hungry and have an appointment over lunch, so I eat a banana I brought from home and a Reese's egg my coworker brought me. 11:15 a.m. — I leave work and go to Home Depot to buy supplies for a painting project I'm heading up tomorrow with my church and Habitat for Humanity. I pay $16.97, which will be reimbursed. ($16.97 expensed) 12:15 p.m. — I have an appointment with my bikini waxer that I already paid for. I leave a tip. $10 1:oo p.m. — I go to Costco to order a cake for my coworker's baby shower next week. While I'm there, I buy moisturizer, vitamins, facial wipes, antibacterial wipes, and a variety pack of LaCroix. (We drink a LOT of flavored water at our house.) $72.19 1:30 p.m. — I still haven't eaten, and I need to get back to work, so I stop at Chick-fil-A and get a nugget meal with fries and a Coke. $6.59 3:30 p.m. — My boss and I have been collecting money to buy a gift for my coworker's shower next week. I walk around and do a last call for contributions to the group gift. We've collected over $300, so I think we did pretty well. 4:45 p.m. — I've wrapped up everything I needed to get done this week, and it's pretty quiet around the office, so I bounce for the weekend! 6:30 p.m. — D. and I watch while I make dinner. I bake chicken breaded in ground-up plantain chips and roast potatoes. I manage to burn my hand on one of the oven racks when I take the potatoes out and have to run water over it for a while. I can tell it's going to blister and scar, but at least dinner is good. 8:30 p.m. — D. is working all weekend and has to be up at 4 a.m., so he goes to sleep in the guest room, and I stay up watching TV. I have to be up early, so I go to bed around 11. Daily Total: $88.78",5,273
"6 a.m. — Strong winds woke me up throughout the night. I get up, feed the dogs, bundle up, and load up all the supplies for painting the house. 7:15 a.m. — I'm out the door and on my way across town to paint this house. It's 35 degrees and windy, so I'm hoping people show up. I stop at McDonald's on the way for a sausage McGriddle and a hash brown. $4.33 10:30 a.m. — Luckily, plenty of volunteers turn up for the paint project despite it being near freezing and extremely windy, and we get in done in just over two hours. The homeowner is so grateful. One of the other volunteers brought a ton of snacks and gives me a bunch of leftover breakfast tacos to take home. 11:30 a.m. — I get home and take a hot shower to warm up after the cold morning. I throw in a load of laundry, warm up two of the breakfast tacos for lunch, and then get ready to go on to my next volunteer activity for the day. 12:30 p.m. — I'm on my way to volunteer for a prom dress boutique for a women's organization I'm part of and as I'm waiting at a stop light, I give a homeless man on the corner a few dollars and granola bars I keep in my car. We talk about the weather until the light changes. $2 3 p.m. — I'm done with volunteer project #2 for the day, and head back home. I think about going to the grocery store but I'm totally wiped out, so I just stop at CVS to buy knockoff ZzzQuil for D. and head home. I move the laundry from earlier to the dryer, stick in another load, and lay down for a quick nap before D. gets home. $11.99 5 p.m. — I'm back up and fold the first round of laundry and wait for D. to get home. We both put on several layers of clothes and bundle up to spend a few hours outside at the Fort Worth Food + Wine Festival. 6 p.m. — There's unlimited craft beer from local breweries and food from over a dozen local restaurants while local bands play. Quite a few of our friends are here, so we socialize and try amazing burgers and beer. Once the sun goes down, it gets pretty cold, so we call it a night. 10:30 p.m. — I watch TV and hang out with the dogs for a while before heading to bed. Daily Total: $18.32",6,273
"7:30 a.m. — The dogs start whining for their breakfast, so I get up and feed them. I try to go back to sleep but end up just lying in bed until it's time for me to get up and get ready for church. I eat two more of the leftover tacos from yesterday and head over. 10:30 a.m. — I'm on two different committees for church and they both happen to meet today, one before the service, and one after. 12:30 p.m. — I go to Buy Buy Baby to buy a group baby gift with the money I collected from my coworkers. I buy a $300 gift card, a few smaller things from her registry, and cards for everyone to sign. ($331.01 expensed) 1 p.m. — I wanted to go to a local salad place for lunch, but it's super packed and I can't even find a spot in the parking lot, so I decide to skip it and just move on to my next errand: Trader Joe's. I don't come to TJ's super often, but there are certain products I always buy here and stock up on. I buy four bottles of cold brew concentrate for D., plantain chips, Chomps, a few packs of frozen rice, peanut puffs, blood oranges, two pre-packed salads to eat for lunch during the week, face oil, and vitamin E to put on my burn from Friday. I eat one of the Chomps and the peanut puffs in the car while I drive to my next stop. $82.38 1:30 p.m. — I go to Sprouts to buy the rest of our groceries for the week. I pick up a package of chicken thighs, a whole chicken, romaine lettuce, grapes, apples, clementines, bananas, red onions, bell peppers, zucchini, tomatoes, avocado, mushrooms, watermelon, and almonds and mixed nuts from the bulk bins. $59 2:15 p.m. — It's been raining a lot lately, so my car is long overdue for a wash. I stop to get a deluxe wash and interior vacuum. $12 2:30 p.m. — I run home, unload my groceries, and change out of my church clothes. I have just enough time to cut up the chicken thighs and stick them in a citrus herb marinade before I have to run out the door for a massage appointment. 4:15 p.m. — I'm done with my massage and feeling a lot better. The massage is covered by a prepaid monthly package I bought, but I leave an $18 tip. I'm feeling super relaxed but also pretty drowsy, and I have a lot of chores left to do, so I stop at Starbucks for a chai frappuccino. I don't drink coffee or really much caffeine at all, but when I do, I go for tea. I use my rewards on my Starbucks card to cover it. $18 5:30 p.m. — D. gets home from work just in time to watch the last bit of the Masters. I take the chicken I marinated earlier and chop up bell peppers, red onion, mushrooms, and zucchini to  make kabobs. D. smokes them on our Traeger while I clean up the kitchen and put laundry away. We eat dinner together, and then I catch up on work emails. I'll be out of office for the next two days attending trainings, so I am trying to prevent myself from getting too far behind while I'm out. 9 p.m. — I spend the last bit of my weekend putting away laundry, cleaning up the house, and then picking out my clothes for the rest of the week. I try to do this on Sunday nights so I don't waste time in the mornings being indecisive. I shower, watch TV for a bit, and then head to bed at 11 p.m. Daily Total: $171.38",7,273
"8 a.m. — Stayed up way past our bedtime last night, and no one feels like cooking breakfast, so we head out to the local greasy spoon. I order a three-egg omelet with spinach, mushrooms, light cheese, and home fries. My husband orders the full breakfast with French toast, over easy eggs, bacon, sausage, and a side of ham. My daughter has a chocolate chip pancake with a side of pineapple. This place isn't the same as it used to be; I'm not sure my eggs were even real. I hope I remember this the next time my husband suggests we come here. Oh well, at least my two cups of coffee were included in the meal. $50 9:45 a.m. — I take a shower and exfoliate using a coffee scrub I bought a few weeks ago from Target. This is the third time I've used it, and it looks like I can get one more shower out of it. Yay! 10:30 a.m. — We drive 20 minutes to a horse barn in New Hampshire so my daughter can go to her riding lesson. We usually don't go on Sundays, but my daughter has to make up a missed lesson. 11:15 a.m. — We take our dog to the dog park. We come here about once a week, and I know most of the other dogs' names. 12:15 p.m. — Back to the horse barn. It usually takes my daughter an hour to ride and another hour to tack/untack the horses. Sundays are typically faster though, and she'd been begging us to come back to see her ride. I don't feel like going, but this is what it means to be a parent. 12:45 p.m. — We stop on the way home at a mini-market because my daughter wants snacks. She grabs peanut M&Ms for me, a pack of gum and a soda for her dad, and Skittles for herself. It's all junk, but it's the weekend, so we let her have what she wants. $8.50 1:30 p.m. — At home, I have a mini-argument with my husband about what we're going to eat this week. Basically, neither of us feels like grocery shopping. We really need to do this on Saturdays, so we can have Sundays to just chill, but we never seem to make that work, so here we are. 2:30 p.m. — We agree on the list and head to Whole Foods. My husband thinks WF is a scam, but I do feel like the taste/quality is better there. We buy organic cauliflower, carrots, chips, bananas, mangos, apple, pears, strawberries, mushrooms, white potatoes, spinach, mandarin oranges, romaine lettuce, an heirloom tomato, two pounds of gulf shrimp (I won't eat any other kind, the imported stuff is slimy to me), bone-in chicken breast, two packages of pre-seasoned chicken breast, organic yogurt, chicken stock, chicken demi-glace, organic mozzarella cheese, and three cans of Steaz iced tea. I also buy nori to make homemade avocado rolls at home for my daughter. $151.95 3 p.m. — Next stop is Target. We buy two Nivea lotions (we don't share lotion), laundry pods, fabric softener, dryer sheets, toothpaste, and a new muffin pan (since I turned my old one into a game for our dog). Also, since my husband really doesn't want to go to our local grocery store, we end up buying Smartfood, Goldfish, gummy candies, potato chips, Oreos, bagels, donuts, and LaCroix ($50). I'm annoyed, because it is so much more expensive than it would be at our local Market Basket, where most snacks are two for $5, but I'm not feeling up to the going to a third store either. $174.18 3:30 p.m. — Come home and start to put the groceries away. My husband empties out all the bags, and I put the stuff away. I always feel like I get the short end of the stick here, but when he's not home, and I put the stuff away, it does feel like way more work, so maybe he's actually helping. 4 p.m. — I put half of the rice in the rice cooker so I can make my daughter her avocado sushi rolls. I also make egg muffin bites for breakfast for the week. 5 p.m. — My daughter wants me to watch with her (only for the thousandth time), and I feel like I haven't spent too much time with her lately, so I head to the basement to our mini-home theater (three seats and an old projector) to watch the movie. 7 p.m. — Come back upstairs to heat up leftover pho from Tuesday, which we made in our Crock-Pot. Our big goal lately has been to spend less money on eating out and to cook dinner at home most nights of the week. 7:45 p.m. — I fold a load of laundry and then sit on the couch for a little me time. I let my husband wash the dishes. We follow the ""cook doesn't clean up"" rule as much as possible. He usually gets the short end of the stick here, because I make a huge mess in the kitchen most of the time. But tonight it isn't too bad. 8:45 p.m. — I get an email from my library that an ebook I put on loan is ready. Sweet, right in time to read before bedtime. No matter how tired I am, I always try to read for 15 minutes or more at night. It's the only time I can wind down and start to shut my mind down. 9 p.m. — Tidy up the house and head upstairs to bed. I can't settle into a book that I like tonight, so I scroll through social media and organize my paperless lists. I need to find a good book soon. 10 p.m. — Lights out. Daily Total: $384.63",1,274
"4:30 a.m. — I doze while my husband gets ready for work. My daughter still crawls into bed with us in the morning. She's an early riser, but we made a rule that she has to stay in bed (she chooses ours) until Dad leaves at 5 a.m. for work. Then she can go downstairs, watch YouTube, and play with the dog until it's time to get ready at 6:30 a.m. 6:30 a.m. — I end up oversleeping at bit, but it's okay since I don't have to wash my hair. I take a quick shower while my daughter packs her lunch and eats her breakfast. 7 a.m. — Microwave two egg muffin bites and pack a yogurt with mango and strawberries. Put a load of laundry in the washer right before we leave. 7:20 a.m. — Now we're running late. Good thing my daughter's school is only five minutes away. 7:25 a.m. — Fight the school drop off line. This is the stuff memes are made of. 7:30 a.m. — Stop at the local coffee shop for my daily cappuccino. My husband calls me as I'm driving, and we talk over Bluetooth. He did the math for me on how much I spend on coffee a year, so we're talking about buying an espresso machine, but I have yet to decide on the model I want. The cheapest one I can find that will make a decent cappuccino is over $500. $4 9 a.m. — Squeak into the parking lot near my office. If you get in before 9:05, it's $24 for the day. Anything later is at least $40. Sometimes I take the bus, but I've been working late the past couple of months, so I've been driving most days. $24 9:15 a.m. — Grab my mobile order from Starbucks. Venti black iced tea with three pumps of sugar. I really need to break this habit of two drinks in the morning. I'm always thirsty from my cappuccino, and even though I fill up a thermos with water and keep it in my car, the iced tea always hit the spot. $3.24 10 a.m. — Email with our director to talk about changes to our website. I have a year-round intern, so she and I split up the task. We've been incredibly lucky to hire good interns. They are always worth their weight in gold. 11 a.m. — Answering emails and meetings all morning. I have another meeting in 30 minutes, so I eat the yogurt and fruit I brought from home. 11:45 a.m. — I order a Kale Caesar salad from Sweetgreen to pick up at 1 p.m. after my meeting. $10.65 1:15 p.m. — The meeting went 15 minutes longer than planned, but I'm still able to eat lunch with my coworkers before my 2 p.m. meeting. We're a small office, and we usually all eat lunch together. There is a huge variety in age amongst my coworkers, which makes for diverse conversation, from the Kardashians to grandbabies. 2 p.m. — Important meeting with the directors where we walk through an upcoming event. I speak up a few times but feel like I could have contributed more. 4:45 p.m. — Leave the office to head to the parking garage. I know traffic is not going to be pretty heading home. 5 p.m. — My coworker calls me to talk about work and her recent vacation. We're friends outside of the office, too. 6:15 p.m. — Come home to my husband working out on the Peloton bike. He did a 60-minute ride and is dripping in sweat. For dinner, we reheat meatballs, and he boils gluten-free pasta for me and angel hair for him. I make my daughter an avocado sushi roll per her request and she eats a banana and strawberries for dinner. 7 p.m. — Finish dinner, and my husband agrees to do the dishes so I can take a much-needed shower. I usually take two showers a day, which is a waste of water, but I feel like it's necessary. I sweat a lot. 7:30 p.m. — My daughter wants me to watch the pilot episode of with her. She was too young when it came out in 2015, and she is probably too young now, but she unfortunately sees worse on YouTube. I'm not big on censoring her music or movies, but there are plenty of shows and movies we don't think she should watch. 8:30 p.m. — Check Mint to see what we've purchased today. My husband typically buys lunch because his job requires him to visit several hospitals and clinics over the week, and he's often traveling between campuses during the day. 9 p.m. — Upstairs to relax in bed before lights out. I'm reading by a local author. 10 p.m. — Lights out. Daily Total: $41.89",2,274
"5 a.m. — I sleep through my husband's 4:30 alarm – thank God! But my daughter crawls into bed with me at 5 a.m. to snuggle. The thing I miss the most about not having a kid is sleep. I dream about the days when I could sleep until noon or sneak into work late because I slept until 8:30. 6:30 a.m. — Today is my work-from-home day, so I don't have to rush. I still get up and get dressed, though. I know some people can work at home in their pajamas, but that doesn't work for me. I check email while my daughter gets ready for school. The best part of parenting an 11-year-old is that she can do most tasks by herself. She asks me to make her a bagel for breakfast while she packs her lunch. Usually I don't have time, but since it's my work-from-home day, I happily toast her bagel. 7:20 a.m. — Drop off the dog at doggie daycare. Our dog goes twice a week. If she doesn't, she tears the house apart on the days she is home alone. It's $25 a visit, but I can drop off at 7 a.m. and pick up at 7 p.m. I consider it money well spent. My husband and I have been discussing dropping the dog walking service we've had since our dog was eight-weeks-old. By the fall, our daughter will be old enough to come straight home from school, so the dog will be left alone at home for less time, and we'll save $60 bucks a week. 7:25 a.m. — Drop off my daughter and head for our local coffee shop for my morning cappuccino. $4 8 a.m. — Work call with our Accounts Payable person. She's a friend, so the call turns into a personal chat about how everything is going with her. 9 a.m. — I scrub our websites for broken links. I do this every week, so there aren't too many to fix. My desktop and MacBook both need updates, so I update them and decide to take a shower while I'm waiting. I shave my legs quickly and nick my leg (ouch!). 9:30 a.m. — Back on email. Working on the updates per our meeting yesterday. Receive an email about an upcoming PSA we are doing. The best part of working at a nonprofit is the opportunity to do a lot of different things, since resources are limited. But there's always more work to do. If only I had another 12 hours in a day. Or didn't need to sleep. 10 a.m. — Snack on organic yogurt and homemade granola with cranberries, walnuts, and almond slivers (yum!). I made the granola last week, and my husband sliced strawberries on Sunday. If we buy a quart of strawberries and don't slice them right away, no one seems to eat them, and the whole expensive organic mold mess gets trashed. 10:30 a.m. — Get an email from my friend at work with a Groupon offer for an indoor water park for school vacation week. Since it's a busy time for me at work, my husband has to take time off next week to take care of our daughter. This is a new development: While he was in the military, it was out of the question for him to take time off. He was away most of the time at training, or deployed. It's definitely been an adjustment, but this is one of the perks. I buy two tickets for $22 each for next Friday. $44.19 11:30 a.m. — Conference call with the entire team. We have a fairly new director, and her leadership style is toxic. It's mostly me listening in on the phone on mute, so I drink a LaCroix. 12:15 p.m. — Check the mail after my conference call is over. Our dog's Bullymake Box arrives today, and we get charged for it. It has a toy with bacon on it, plus a new cosmic ball, a Kong shaped like a grenade, and a nylon chew toy shaped like a fidget spinner. $39 12:30 p.m. — Also in the mail is a Mini Boden catalogue. My daughter is almost too old/tall for much of their clothes, but they also have a line for older girls called Johnnie B. I buy her two rompers and a three-pair pack of underwear. I use the 20% off code on the back of the catalogue. We're trying to limit spending on clothing to no more than $300 a month for the whole family. I can go a little crazy when it comes to my daughter's wardrobe, but I stay in control today. $94.40 1:30 p.m. — I fold a load of laundry and vacuum the first floor of our house. We buy the house a Christmas present every year, and last year it was two Dyson vacuums: one cordless for the hardwood downstairs, and one upright for the carpet. Honestly, I use the cordless the most and I know I'll buy another one when this one dies. 3 p.m. — I start an early dinner since I didn't eat lunch and my husband is on his way home early today. I make bone-in chicken breasts with demi-glace, mashed potatoes, spinach with Parmesan cheese, and mushrooms with garlic. Great meal, and the best part is: My husband has clean-up duty! 4:30 p.m. — My husband cannot stop laughing because I received an email from thredUp that my items were received and I'm getting a whopping $14.95. I sent jeans with tags on them from Kut from the Kloth, Hudson, Henry & Belle, and Liverpool, so I am not happy. I knew the risk, but needless to say, I won't be using thredUp again. 5 p.m. — Pick up the doggo from daycare. 6 p.m. — I was supposed to go over to my friend's house for an early week wine night (we typically meet on Thursdays), but she received some really bad news about her mom, so we reschedule. I head down to my basement to get in a workout on the Peloton. Alex Toussaint is calling my name. 45 minutes later, I'm feeling a lot more energized. 7 p.m. — My mom calls me just as I end my ride. We chat about her errands and work. She raised me and my two brothers without help from our father, and she doesn't make a lot of money, so I help her out when I can. It's her birthday this week, and all she wants is new clothes. I buy her new bras and underwear from Victoria Secret ($172.50), plus two pairs of work pants from Old Navy ($84.23). I use promo codes on both purchases. $256.73 7:30 p.m. — My daughter requests another avocado roll. I ask my husband to make the rice, and twenty minutes later I roll one for us and one for her. 8 p.m. — Fold another load of laundry. It really is endless when you have a house, dog, and child. Clean up after said dog and child: toys for the dog, various cups and snacks for the babe. 8:30 p.m. — I take a shower, then go through my nightly skincare ritual. I use Bioelements foaming wash, Crucial Moisture, eye cream, and serum. It's old school, but my aesthetician uses all their products, and I think they work for me. 9 p.m. — TMI ahead, but we've been married for over a decade, and we've always made sex a priority as a couple. It ebbs and flows given what's going on in our lives, but we make it a priority to reconnect physically about every three days. 10 p.m. — Lights out! Unless I'm super stressed out, I usually fall asleep very easily. Also, my husband was very giving tonight, so I drift off to weightless sleep in no time. Daily Total: $438.32",3,274
"4 a.m. — OMG why is my kid up already? Go back to sleep, please. I give her permission to go downstairs, because my head is pounding. I didn't drink enough water after my Peloton workout last night. UGH. I sip water and go back to bed. 6:15 a.m. — Okay, now I officially have to get up, so of course I browse social media on my phone for few minutes and then finally crawl out of bed. I am hoping a cup of black tea will ease my aching head. 6:30 a.m. — Drink tea and eat my egg bites. I'm hungry this morning after eating an early dinner yesterday. My head hurts and I don't feel like emptying the dishwasher, so I hand wash the bowls and utensils my daughter and I used. 6:45 a.m. — My daughter asks me to make her a bagel, but I tell her I don't have time, as I have to jump in the shower. I head upstairs and notice she's made her bed, but she threw her pajamas on the ground. I fold up the pajamas while the shower heats up. We switched to a tankless water heater last year and it takes a couple minutes to heat up. We're saving water, but it always seems like such a waste to run it. I wash my hair with Kevin Murphy Angel Wash shampoo and conditioner. My hair totally changed after having my daughter — it's much thinner and finer than before, so I need something that won't weigh it down. I put Bioelements Radiance Rescue mask on my face in the shower, and then lather up with my lavender body soap from Whole Foods. Shower off, towel dry, then use Bioelements Equalizer, Crucial Moisture, eye cream, and RayDefense (SPF 30). 7 a.m. — While getting dressed, I notice I have a run in my navy stockings. Unfortunately, it's the only pair that matches the dress I picked out. The run is above the knee and the dress goes over my knees, so I wear it anyway. I make a mental note to buy a new pair. 7:15 a.m. — Dice a mango, add sliced strawberries, and take an organic Wallaby yogurt. My daughter tells me she needs money for a book fair, so we stop by the ATM. $30 7:30 a.m. — Head to the coffee shop after dropping off my daughter at school. I'm still feeling hungry this morning and want something sweet, so I grab a cinnamon roll. $8 9:15 a.m. — Arrive at the office and can see our director talking to the graphic designer. That is never a good sign, and I hope today is not going to be one of those days. 11 a.m. — Ninety-minute team meeting. I bring my yogurt to eat. 1 p.m. — Head out with two coworkers for lunch. I pick up my Kale Caesar with salmon from Sweetgreen, and we head over to Chicken & Rice Guys, where my two coworkers want to eat. Suddenly my salad isn't as appealing. Sweetgreen is off their game today; my salad is only two thirds full and there are hardly any Parmesan cheese crisps (which is usually the best part). $13.05 2 p.m. — Back to work after a great lunch of catching up with my coworkers. 4 p.m. — Head to the parking garage and commute home. I work a longer day at home on Tuesdays so I can leave before traffic on other days. The trade off is I agree to check email every night until 8 p.m. Most nights are quiet, but when we're close to an event, it's a lot of late nights. $24 5:30 p.m. — Arrive home and chat with my husband. It turned into a nice day, so I take the dog outside for a game of fetch. My husband and I are both in the mood for seafood takeout, so we make the order and chat for a bit. Since he gets home earlier most days, he picks up our daughter from after school and helps her with her homework. My daughter comes up to say hi, and I always feel better just seeing her smiling face. 6 p.m. — We eat. It's good, but another place that is just not the same as it used to be. My husband bought me a soda as a surprise. He knows my weakness too well. I wash the dishes from breakfast and dinner. $45.15 6:30 p.m. — I take a shower, towel off, and lather up with lotion and oil. I see that I'm almost out of oil, so I order another bottle using my Amazon Prime subscription. $11.95 7:30 p.m. — Hang out with the hubby while he tells me about his day. He really loves his job, but his workload is much less than when he was in the military, where he was responsible for more than 2,000 soldiers. I think he's a little bored. He wants to direct his own hospital someday. 8 p.m. — I read a chapter of my daughter's new book, , out loud to her. It's been a long time since she's asked me to read to her, so even though I just want to relax on the couch, I'm happy she asked. She's not feeling well, so I give her Motrin. I think it's cramps — she recently started getting her period. 10 p.m. — Stay up later than usual, thanks to the Coke. My husband wants to know what Money Diaries is all about, so I read him a few, and now he's hooked. 11 p.m. — Lights out after staying awake to watch the final episode of . I've been watching this show since Cycle One, and it's a guilty pleasure. Daily Total: $132.15",4,274
"5 a.m. — The dog is whining to go outside, so I bump my way downstairs. I really can't see much without my contacts. While I wait for the dog, I hear my daughter leave her room and climb into my bed. Her stomach still hurts, and she's feeling nauseous now. Maybe it isn't cramps. 5:30 a.m. — Since I'm up, I check out the new show on the Hulu app on my phone. I end up watching the first three episodes. Some of the interactions feel forced, but overall, I like it. Add the show to my Watch List. 7 a.m. — Decide to go into work late today. My husband agrees to come home early so my daughter will only be alone for a couple of hours. I make a mental note to let my neighbor know she's home, just in case. The neighbor works from home every day (dream job!) and is willing to play second mom when I'm not home. Since we have no family around, we rely on our network of friends. I hate to ask for help, so we only rely on neighbors when we have to. 7:30 a.m. — Take a shower and then wash my face and apply daily concoctions. I remember to put sunscreen on my face, neck, and chest. It's easier to wash my face in the shower, but I read it causes wrinkles because the water is usually too hot for your face. I just recently started to notice fine lines and wrinkles around my eyes. I don't love this about being 35, but I have to say I'm happier and more confident now versus 10 years ago when I had no wrinkles. 8 a.m. — I still need coffee, and my daughter rides with me to drop the dog off at daycare and pick up my cappuccino. I get a cinnamon roll again today. $8 8:30 a.m. — I check my work email. My boss is working from home, and my intern is running late. 10:15 a.m. — Arrive at work to multiple issues that need addressing immediately. Since my boss and her boss are both out today, it's on me. I try not to panic and fix what I can.  It's not the deadline that bothers me, but the lack of clear direction. 12:45 p.m. — I pick-up my Kale Caesar from Sweetgreen. It's on point today. $10.65 4 p.m. — Our new T-shirts for our upcoming event arrive, and I happily deliver them to everyone's desks. 4:45 p.m. — Pay for my parking and am off to fight the traffic. $24 5:30 p.m. — Stop at Whole Foods for a slice of pizza, a can of Steaz peach tea, a Rice Krispies treat, and a bag of chocolate chip cookies for my daughter. $12.98 6:15 p.m. — Home. I fold load of laundry, start the dishwasher, and change into yoga pants and a sweater. I have a pedicure appointment at 6:45 at my local spa. I go there for my facials and massages, too. Just the smell of the place (lavender and clean towels) makes me relax. 7:45 p.m. — My toes look great in OPI Malibu Pink, and I feel relaxed and refreshed. I buy eye cream while paying ($34). $89 8 p.m. — Get home to check on my daughter, who still isn't feeling 100%. I put the clothes in the dryer, then throw my black Rothy's into the washer. 9 p.m. — Upstairs to bed. I try out a five-minute deep-sleep meditation app. I like it, but I think the yearly fee of $100 is a bit much. I pass out. Daily Total: $144.63",5,274
"5:30 a.m. — Wake up, and my daughter is in my bed. She still doesn't feel well. I have to go into work this morning, so I text my husband to see if he can come home early. He can, so I stay in bed for a few more. 6:30 a.m. — Take a shower, do my morning skincare routine, and get dressed. Then I load the dishwasher and do a load of laundry. 7:30 a.m. — Arrive at the coffee shop and receive two texts. One from my director telling me to come into her office as soon as I get in (great!), and the other from my husband who says he has to send $200 to his niece. I'll get the full story later, as I need to drive now. I pick up a veggie wrap with eggs, spinach, feta, and caramelized onion to go along with my cappuccino. $211 9 a.m. — Squeak into parking lot, order my Starbucks on the mobile app, pick it up, and head into work before 9:15. $3.24 9:15 a.m. — My boss is being fired today. My director wants me to lock my boss out of all of her accounts while they're in the meeting firing her. IT takes care of her email, computer, and phone, but we have the logins to our websites and social media. 9:30 a.m. — My soon-to-be fired boss comes to my desk to chat. She worked at home yesterday and wants to talk boards for our upcoming event. I am sick to my stomach having to pretend. 10 a.m. — My boss and director go in our ED's office. It's time to start canceling stuff. It takes a lot less time than I thought. 11 a.m. — I've been hiding in a coworker's office for the past 45 minutes. Cowardly, but I really don't want the awkward goodbye. They are giving her an hour to clear her office and resign. Also, they don't want anyone talking about this. Eye roll. 12:30 p.m. — She is still here, and I need to get out of this oppressive environment of pretending. A group of us go to lunch and talk about the way things have gone downhill in the past two years. I buy a rice plate at Chicken & Rice Guys. $8.50 3 p.m. — It's a beautiful day, and we're reluctant to go inside, but our lunch break is over. I am relieved to hear my boss has left. I feel a little annoyed at the fact they expect us to not talk about this. It's been five months of absolute chaos, and I feel shell shocked. 6 p.m. — Get home and I am annoyed to find the house is a mess. My husband has this annoying habit of opening all of the mail and then leaving it all on the counter, including mail that is clearly trash. I decide to take the dog for a walk to clear my head and enjoy the weather. My husband decides to join, and we walk over to an ice cream place near our house. I buy a scoop of mint cookie ice cream for me and a scoop of cookie dough ice cream for my daughter. $8.50 7:30 p.m. — I'm feeling better, but then I get into a silly argument with my husband that my daughter jumps in on. He says my feet stink, and I need to do something about it. I walk away pissed, fold the laundry, empty the dishwasher, and then go up to take a bath. Lavender bath salts do the trick every time! 8:30 p.m. — Go back downstairs and order pizza for my daughter, wings for my husband, and cheesy breadsticks for me. My husband and daughter drive to the next town over to pick up the food. I stay home to enjoy alone time. $40 9:15 p.m. — Bedtime. My hubby is putting out VIBES, but I'm tired and still stressed about the day, so I ignore them. He wants to cuddle, but I tell him I just don't have anything left in me tonight. I fall asleep fast. Daily Total: $271.24",6,274
"7 a.m. — I get up after lying in bed for an extra 30 minutes. I feel much better this morning and we decide to get up, change the sheets, make a grocery list, and get to Whole Foods when it opens at 8. 8:15 a.m. — We make it to WF, and there are already a lot of people here. WTH. We buy strawberries, apples, pears, mandarin oranges, carrot chips, mushrooms, bananas, avocados, a bell pepper, sweet potatoes, medium carrots, bagged onions, Wallaby yogurt, frozen wild Alaskan salmon, boneless chicken thighs, chicken drumsticks, a pound of stewed beef, beef broth, frozen scallops, shrimp, clams, and calamari. I pick up another pack of nori and carrot wraps, too. I also see that my soap is on sale for $7.99 when it's usually $12.99, so I buy three bottles. I grab a coffee while my husband pays. $203.24 9:30 a.m. — We arrive at Market Basket near our house. We buy organic celery, snow peas, Capri Sun, Oreos, chocolate chip cookies, Lucky Charms, almond milk, corn bread, tzatziki, lemonade, passion fruit juice, burrito wraps, gluten-free crackers, Cheetos, butter, whole milk, onions and tomatoes diced with cilantro, and Crystal Light (for my husband). My husband has to drink sugar-free everything. His father was just diagnosed with diabetes, so he's cut most extra sugar. $163.60 10:15 a.m. — Get home and empty the car. Hubby volunteers to make us breakfast while I shower to get ready for yoga. It's one-on-one, and I like to feel fresh. It's nice out, so my daughter takes the dog out for a run. 11 a.m. — My daughter and I drive to her horseback riding lesson. It's my mom's birthday, so we call and wish her a happy birthday. 11:30 a.m. — Drop my daughter off at the barn. 11:45 a.m. — Arrive at the yoga studio. I've been doing one-on-one yoga for about a year and a half now. The instructor is really knowledgeable, down-to-earth, and practical at the same time. We always chat about life before we start. She's helped me work through some shit in my life. I consider it therapy and well worth the money. I pay her three visits at a time for $60 a visit. Today is my last of the three, so I buy a new set. This session is a lot of upper body work. I'm still a novice, but I can definitely see the progress I've made since I started. $180 12:45 p.m. — Our session is done, and I head to the horse barn to pick up my daughter. 1:15 p.m. — We get home, and my husband is burning leaves in a barrel in the driveway. His attempt is not successful, and I add branch removal to my list of things to talk to the landscaping company about. 1:30 p.m. — Husband agrees to grill the pre-seasoned chicken we never got around to eating during the week. We decide to make wraps. He uses the burrito wraps, and I try the carrot ones. We both add lettuce, avocado, chicken, and shredded cheese, and I add cucumber to mine while he adds the diced onions and tomatoes to his. I add a side of chips and a pickle, and drink a LaCroix. 2 p.m. — My turn to clean up. Then I go online to return a Lululemon shirt and yoga pants. 2:30 p.m. — Taxes. We owe $12,032 to federal and $887 to California, where my husband was living and working last year. Even though we both claimed zero on our taxes last year, it still wasn't enough. This year we tripled checked the withholding calculator that the IRS sent out. It said we had to claim zero and an additional $300 each paycheck. Our overall take-home pay went down, but I cannot pay this amount again next year. I die a little inside as I put both checks in the mail. This is one of those times when being an adult sucks. $12,919 3 p.m. — We make an appointment to speak with a financial planner my neighbor also sees. We don't know how much money we should be contributing to our 401(k)s. It's confusing, because my husband already gets a retirement from the military. I also don't know if we should be putting more towards our daughter's college fund. After all our deductions, bills, and expenses are paid, we have about $2,000 left. We don't know if we should use the extra money to pay off our car, pay off our house, invest, or something else. Both of us were raised by single moms, and though we're by no means rich, we have no one in our families who makes as much as we do. We try to talk to some of our friends about this, but most are 10 to 15 years older than us, and it's still a very taboo topic. 3:30 p.m. — We're both tired and decide to take a quick nap before we get ready to go over to our friend's house for dinner. My husband takes a 20-minute nap and I wake up and decide to keep sleeping. I Google how long to take a nap, and it says 20 or 90 minutes. Sweet, I choose 90. 5 p.m. — I wake up feeling refreshed and jump in the shower. My husband goes to the liquor store to get a bottle of chardonnay. I dress and get ready, then pull the organic carrots chips and tzatziki out of the fridge to take with us. $15 5:40 p.m. — We're late, and I feel bad when we arrive and my friend has made a mozzarella and tomato appetizer. It's clear I didn't try very hard. 6 p.m. — Our friends make steak, roasted asparagus, and Caesar salad. We have M&Ms for dessert, then play 45s. It's a confusing game, and we are definitely amateurs. 11 p.m. — We're home and agree to ""reconnect"" tomorrow morning. 11:55 p.m. — Hubby goes to bed, and I stay up watching a friend's vlog. She's walking the Appalachian Trail, and I am in awe of her. She posts a video every few days and just crossed over to NC. I would love to do something life-changing like this, but I love of showers too much. Oh well, I can live vicariously through her. Daily Total: $13,480.84",7,274
"7 a.m. — Hit snooze a couple of times and drag myself out of bed – I'm exhausted after a late night pillow-talk with my fiancé. We're an intercultural couple (I'm American, he's from North Africa and lived there until a few years ago), and we find ourselves often in these deep conversations in the evenings about how we will handle various life decisions. Some of it's tough stuff, but all of it makes us feel so much closer to each other. I wake up tired but glowing with love for this man sleeping next to me, and I cannot wait to marry him. I KNOW, very lovey dovey – but I have an excuse: I'm a Pisces and I feel ALL of the emotions. 7:30 a.m. — My cousin stayed with us last night after her flight back to California was cancelled due to yet another storm. I throw an egg on to boil while I do my makeup and drink my first cup of coffee. Once my egg is done, I peel and eat it with a few blue corn tortilla chips and hummus (weird, I know…but so good!). I throw on my clothes, take the pup for a quick walk, kiss my fiancé, and I'm out the door. 9:05 a.m. — Whew, made it through the commute and I'm only five minutes late to work! My boss is extremely punctual and often gets to the office a few hours earlier than us, so when we aren't here by 9 a.m., he notices. 12:45 p.m. — I head out to pick up my MealPal lunch, an acai bowl from a juice shop down the street. I am loving MealPal – I get to pick lunch from a nearby restaurant every day, and it's a huge money saver. The meals work out to be about $6 per lunch, which is a steal for NYC! I tried bringing my own lunch for a long time, but I've decided it's just not worth the trouble for me to take the time to meal plan on Sundays. Ain't nobody got time for that. I bring my acai back to the office and pop a handful of extra nuts in there that I bought at Duane Reade earlier this week – super delicious and filling. YUM. 4 p.m. — Coffee time. I head downstairs with my coworker to our usual afternoon two-dollar coffee spot down the block. We spend the 10 minutes away from our desks complaining about the office and wondering out loud to each other why we put ourselves through this. Whoever thinks interior design and architecture is a “fun” job is kidding themselves! My coworker is having a particularly bad week, so I buy his coffee and grab myself pretzels and hummus. This place is amazing – every item is exactly $2 (+ tax). We grab our stuff and head back to the office. $6.50 6:30 p.m. — Finally wrap up the 3D model studies that I'm working on, send one last email, and head out of work to go the gym. My gym is a few blocks from my office, but I'm thinking of cancelling my membership. Now that it's almost warm enough to run outside, I want to dedicate my gym funds to a yoga studio and get my cardio in by running outside. I decided recently it would be best to streamline my practices and choose things that I can pretty much do anywhere and that make me feel good – hello, yoga and running! 7:45 p.m. — Wrap up my run and quickly run out to grab my MealPal dinner from Num Pang: a yummy tofu rice bowl. Jump on the train and head home. 9 p.m. — Walk the dog and then sit down to eat dinner. I scroll through Instagram with the second movie on in the background...ahhh, pure relaxation. This is what I wait for all day! 10 p.m. — Okay just kidding, THIS is what I wait for all day. B. is home from work and winding down from a stressful day. We fill out a fun questionnaire from our wedding photographers about our personalities, and then peruse and refine our online registry. We're sending save-the-dates next week, so this website and registry need to be up and running. YAY wedding! We are just starting to really get into it, and we're about six months out. Around midnight is bedtime. I light a candle and climb in, read a little on my Kindle, and am out in about five minutes. B. blows out the candle, since he's usually up a little longer than I am. Daily Total: $6.50",1,275
"6 a.m. — I wake up about 30 minutes before my alarm when the pup comes in and wants to snuggle into bed with us. This is her thing these days – as the sun comes up, she nudges the door to our room open and makes little whimpering noises at the bedside. I'm not mad about it. She's the littlest spoon. 6:30 a.m. — Alarm goes off and it's time for yoga. I bought a week pass for the yoga studio down the block last week so that I could try it out. I'm really trying to get back into my practice and this is just what I need to heal my muscles from running last night and to start my weekend off on the right foot! I prep my coffee for when I come home so that I can just push the button while I'm getting ready after yoga. I'm out the door by 6:50. 8:05 a.m. — Feeling amazing! Home from yoga in less than two minutes, but still in a huge rush. That's the only issue with these 7 a.m. classes. I need to throw my makeup and clothes on in record speed in order to make it to work in time. Sleepy pup is so confused by my presence – she thought I had left for the day. I pop a kiss on her and my fiancé, pour my coffee in a to-go mug, and I'm back out the door. 9:05 a.m. — I get to work starving, but energized and happy. Someone brought muffins – thank god! I settle in for an easy day of photoshopping renderings for our client presentation next week. I love these kinds of days at work where I'm not really using my brain – just making things look pretty and listening to podcasts. Especially when that day is a Friday! 12:30 p.m. — Head out of the office for lunch, but stop at the post office first to mail a birthday gift to one of my best friends from college who lives in Connecticut. Of course it probably won't arrive in time, as per my usual belated efforts, but I'm happy to have gotten it in the mail. $7.50 12:45 p.m. — Pick up my MealPal lunch and take a phone call with a potential freelance client while I eat. I do a lot of freelance work on the side as a way to make extra money while my fiancé and I plan our wedding. It's not always fun to have to spend my free time doing extra work, but it keeps me motivated, and I'm so thankful to have connections from previous jobs reaching out to me for help. Keeps me going! 1 p.m. — Grab makeup and things I've been needing from Duane Reade…along with a pregnancy test ($15). My period is a little late, which is not entirely unusual for me because I have PCOS, but just in case, I figure I should take a test. I have a rare boozy weekend ahead of me, so I just want to be suuuper sure. $30 2 p.m. — Okay, the suspense is killing me. I need to take this test. I head to the bathroom and do the thing – thankfully, I see a “not pregnant” on the screen. Whew! Not that pregnancy would be the end of the world at this point – I'm 29, I want to have kids, and am with the man that I plan to have them with. But I'd like to have my wedding first! I already have my dress and I'm REALLY looking forward to wearing it. 6:30 p.m. — I wrap up a draft that I've been working on of the presentation we're doing next week and shoot it off to my boss. Then, I head out to go meet one of my best gals for dinner back in Brooklyn. She's one of my bridesmaids, and we've been trying to carve out time to see each other more lately. I am loving these date nights with her to get up to speed on what's going on in her equally busy life. We catch up at a sushi spot that she recommends and share appetizers, rolls, and a beer. Yum! $37 9:30 p.m. — Walk home to quickly freshen up before heading out the door again with B. to meet some of his friends for drinks in the city. I prefer to take a train when I'm heading out for the night instead of Uber, knowing that I'll almost definitely take an Uber home at the end of the night after we've been drinking. 4 a.m. — Well, tonight ended up being one of those quintessential NYC nights! Lots of bar-hopping, LOTS of tequila shots, and so many laughs. B. has a few cousins here in NYC who are from his home country as well, and I've been really trying to spend more quality time with them lately, since they're my future family! Sometimes the language barrier can be awkward at first, but tonight it's no issue. The time flew by and these guys had me in stitches all night. I'm learning Arabic, so I'm starting to pick up on tiny little bits of their humor in conversation. Thankfully, most of my drinks tonight are bought by the guys, so I don't have much remorse on that front. We grab late-night bites at Mamoun's Falafel. $30 4:30 a.m. — We Uber home and I fall asleep in the car. We crawl upstairs, I quickly take the pup outside (she is confused and thinks it's her morning walk), and then we climb into bed. $10 Daily Total: $114.50",2,275
"10 a.m. — OUCH. Oh man, the hangover is real. It takes all of my effort to get out of bed and start the day. I am not used to this – my days of staying out until 4 a.m. are few and far between, and now I remember why! But I don't regret it at all – last night was so much fun, and much needed. The promise of greasy breakfast food is motivating, so I get myself up, brush my teeth, and put on a pot of coffee. 11 a.m. — I had woken up to a text from a former colleague asking if I would be free this weekend to help with a quick freelance project. I respond and say I can help out tomorrow. This hangover will certainly not allow for any productivity, and I have a full day today. I love when projects like this come my way with a quick turnaround – it's not a huge commitment, and it's an easy way to make some extra bucks. We wrap up the call and she sends me all of the project information. 11:30 a.m. — B. is up and ready to go (although struggling like I am), so we decide to go have brunch at the diner down the street before he goes to work. It's not the *best* food in the world, but it certainly does the trick on days like this. B. works on Saturdays and Sundays, as he is a restaurant manager, and those are the days when they need him the most. We meander down the block and grab a table. I order a Snapple, needing something sugary to quench my hangover thirst, plus fish and eggs. B. gets the same and we spend breakfast catching up about last night and talking about our dream of opening a cute little breakfast restaurant. We split the bill, I kiss B. goodbye, and then I head home. $17 1:30 p.m. — I decide to take a quick nap because I know I have more fun ahead of me today, so I make a beeline for the couch when I get home and snuggle up with the dog. 2:15 p.m. — Nap alarm goes off and I wish I didn't have plans today – what I would give to just relax and sleep off this hangover! But I know I have an amazing afternoon ahead of me, so I get up and get ready to head out. I'm meeting my friend to see a live taping of our favorite podcast, , at a theater in Times Square. It's a breakdown of the franchise but it is also so much more than that. I put on an episode of the podcast and grab an iced coffee and French cruller donut at Dunkin' right outside the train station. $4 3:30 p.m. — I arrive outside the theater on 44th and am giddy seeing all the other fans excited to see the show. I wait outside for my friend to arrive, and then we head into the theater. 4 p.m. — Well, what's a -themed live show without wine!? We grab a couple of drinks and find our seats. This first round is on me. $30 6 p.m. — The show is over and my friend and I are still dying over the hilarity of these women who host the show. There's another showing at 8 p.m., and we debate hiding in the storage closet to see it again, but opt instead to meet another friend for more drinks at a nearby bar. 8 p.m. — Okay, two more drinks in me and I'm ready to head home. It was so much fun hanging with the boys, but this is more drinking in one weekend than I've done in quite some time, so I'm definitely hearing the couch call my name. Plus, I know I have a bunch of work to get done tomorrow for my freelance client, so I can't afford to feel hungover again tomorrow. I close my tab and head to the train. $16 9 p.m. — Home and starving because I haven't eaten since brunch this morning. I order pad thai and cozy up on the couch watching TV until B. gets home and we can catch up on our days. $21 10 p.m. — Crap, I realized I forgot to cancel my HBO free week subscription, and my account was just charged. I activated it last week to watch (which was amazing!!!) and forgot to cancel. Oops! Doing that now. $15 12 a.m. — B. is finally home after an extremely busy day at the restaurant, so he is wiped out. I've already lit a candle in our room and turned down our bed so it's ready to climb into. A friend told to me recently that she has been doing her own turn-down service at night as a self-care routine, and I am TOTALLY into it lately too. There is nothing better than walking into your candle-lit bedroom with a fluffy clean bed waiting for you. We both climb in and have a little much needed *fun* time before passing out. Ahhhh, weekends are the best! Daily Total: $103",3,275
"9:30 a.m. — I wake up with immediate anxiety, knowing I'll find a bunch of emails regarding the project I'm due to work on today. I get up, wash my face, brush my teeth, and put on a pot of coffee before taking the dog outside. 9:45 a.m. — Once she's done her business, I take the dog back inside and then hop over to the grocery store across the street for some breakfast fixin's and other essentials for the week. I walk out with bananas, a bag of organic oranges, a red pepper, red skin potatoes, a dozen eggs, cottage cheese, blue corn chips, gluten-free bread, and garbage bags. B. and I have been really trying to eat organic as much as possible lately. $36 10 a.m. — I put the groceries down and can't wait to get to work. I know I have a lot ahead of me and can't put it off for one more minute. I get started while sipping a cup of coffee and listening to jazz music – setting the mood is extremely important for my productivity when working from home. 11 a.m. — B. rolls out of bed to find me working and offers to make breakfast with the groceries I just bought. Bless this man. I am usually the breakfast cook and he is usually the dinner cook, so this is a treat. He is much more patient and intentional with his cooking than I am. I take a work break when the food is ready. 3 p.m. — Okay, this has been rough. The 3D model I'm working on keeps crashing my computer. I know I have a few more hours of work ahead of me at least, but I decide to take a break to walk the dog and go to the bodega to grab a few things. I get a pack of cigarettes, juice, and snacks. I know, I know, smoking is bad — I quit after college and haven't smoked for five years, but I recently picked it back up. It's my vice right now and I plan on quitting soon. I am very hard on myself in almost all areas of my life, so right now I've decided to cut myself some slack and let myself smoke here and there. I have quit before, so I know that I can quit again. $15 6 p.m. — I send the renderings to my clients, and of course they write back with comments within minutes. This is just the nature of interior design and branding, so I get it and I expected it. We go back and forth sharing thoughts and updated renderings for the next couple of hours. 8 p.m. — Okay, I'm hangry. I haven't really eaten since breakfast, so I decide to use Caviar to order food. I text B. to see if he wants anything, and we decide to get Artichoke Pizza using a $10 coupon I have. $20 9 p.m. — Pizza arrives. Holy SH*T. These slices are the size of my head, and we ordered four. I feed the dog dinner and then cut myself a half slice of each pizza flavor (one artichoke, one crab) to eat on the sofa while watching a little TV. My brain needs this break after working since I woke up. 10 p.m. — B. finally gets home after a long day just as I'm wrapping up my work. I send the project off to the client and type up my invoice so I don't forget. Days like this aren't exactly how I'd like to spend my self-care Sundays, but I'm certainly not complaining about the extra lump of cash I'll have in my pocket, or rather in our wedding fund, after this. 11:30 p.m. — My new routine (candle and cozy bed) is proving to be a winner. I am out in minutes. Daily Total: $71",4,275
"7 a.m. — Aaaaand it's back to work-work. It feels like I didn't get a huge break or relaxing weekend due to the freelance yesterday, so I'm not thrilled to be starting the next five-day slog. I get up and do my usual routine: coffee, makeup, hair, get dressed, throw coffee into a travel mug, walk the pup, kiss the fiancé, out the door. 9:05 a.m. — Getting VERY close to actually getting to work on time! But not quite. I sit down and get started on my list of items for the day after reading emails. Our clients on the project I'm working on are based in Hong Kong, so it's always a real treat to get to work in the morning and see what has come in overnight. (They're 12 hours ahead of us, so by the time we get to work, their day is over.) 12:45 p.m. — I head out to go grab my MealPal lunch (another acai bowl), and bring it back to the office. We have a presentation tomorrow, so I don't have time to take my full lunch hour. I absolutely detest when this happens – I think we need work-life balance and to take time to enjoy our lunch hours, but today it just ain't happenin'. 4 p.m. — Bored with my work and doing my usual internet procrastination, I come across a book I've heard about and have wanted to read for awhile: . I'm on this constant journey to beat my anxiety and self-criticism that I suppose comes with being in your late 20s (Am I an adult? Am I old? Am I cool or am I boring?!), so I think this book will be a great one for helping me put things in perspective. I grab a used copy on Amazon Prime. $10 6:30 p.m. — We finally wrap everything up for the presentation tomorrow and get the room ready with all of our printed presentation sheets as well as material samples. I head out and am so excited to go to the gym before heading back to Brooklyn. 7:45 p.m. — Done with my run and rush out the door to go grab a MealPal dinner. I have a few left this week to use up before my month plan is over. I get another tofu rice bowl at Num Pang to bring home and share with B. 9 p.m. — I finally get home after way too many train issues for a Monday night. B. and I share the tofu bowl I brought home and heat up the rest of the pizza from last night. We watch the new Dave Chapelle special on Netflix, which is SO GOOD. Then we head to bed around midnight. Daily Total: $10",5,275
"6:30 a.m. — I'm up early so I can get to the office early before the clients arrive at 9:30. I know our clients will be late because they always are, but I want to be there early in case the bossman is freaking out. 8:30 a.m. — Tensions are high in the office because we have a few huge projects going on right now in addition to the ones I'm working on. I brush off the negative energy as the meeting approaches and decide to just *not care*. Our clients finally arrive about a half hour late and we get into our long agenda. 1:30 p.m. — Meeting is FINALLY over and I am starving. I missed my MealPal lunch window, so I go to a deli nearby to get a make-your-own salad with mixed greens, grapes, grilled chicken, walnuts, avocado, and corn. During my meeting, I got a call that the client on that freelance project I did over the weekend wants to see more options. I'm not complaining, because this means more extra income! It looks like I'll need to dedicate a few evenings this week and the weekend to work on it. $12 6:30 p.m. — I wrap up my work for the day and head out of the office. 7:45 p.m. — I get home and B. is at the grocery store buying ingredients for dinner – yay! When he gets home, he starts cooking while I catch up on personal emails and respond to florists about our wedding flowers. 8:45 p.m. — We eat pan-seared tuna and roasted vegetables while watching a few episodes of Anthony Bourdain's Netflix show, . We LOVE it. B. has traveled to many of the places that have been featured on the show. He knows a lot about food, so it's fun to watch with him. 11:30 p.m. — Candle, Kindle, bed. Daily Total: $12",6,275
"7 a.m. — Wake up and do my usual thing: coffee, makeup, get dressed, walk the pup, out the door. I'm thinking of buying a month membership at that yoga studio today. 8:55 a.m. — Actually get to work early, wahoo! I stop at Pret on my way into the office and grab a coffee since I forgot mine at home (sitting on the table steaming and ready for me to throw a lid on it – UGH), and a salad for lunch because I have a dentist appointment at lunchtime and won't have time to grab food. $12 11:30 a.m. — We have a meet-and-greet meeting with a stone flooring vendor. It's always interesting to hear more about building materials and how they're used. It makes me feel smarter and that much better at my job! 1:30 p.m. — I eat lunch quickly at my desk before leaving for my dentist appointment. This appointment is supposed to be the last in a crown-replacement saga I've been dealing with, but I get there and find that the crowns don't match perfectly, so we decide I need to go to the lab (out in Long Island – UGH) to get fitted. I leave crying and call B. out of frustration. At least I don't have to pay the $900 out of pocket today that I was expecting to. I don't have dental insurance, so this whole debacle is coming out of my savings. (Thank you, freelance work!) 6:30 p.m. — I go to leave the office but remember I want to send our save-the-dates tomorrow, so I take a little time to address the last few while I'm still sitting at my desk. So excited to pop these babies in the mail and let the excitement officially begin! 7:45 p.m. — I get off the train and order shawarma and rice for dinner on my walk home from our fave place. I'm so hungry and do not feel like cooking after this long day. The baba ghanoush at this place is INSANELY good. $20 8 p.m. — I walk in the front door and am so delighted by my pup – her reaction when one of us gets home is so priceless and sweet. I take her outside for a bit and then we go back in to get comfy for the night. I have freelance work to do, but I'm slow to get into it while I decompress and wait for dinner to arrive. 8:30 p.m. — Food is here! I take a break from the work and start an episode of that I missed from earlier this week. Then I quickly clean up and get back into my work with the show on in the background. 10:30 p.m. — B. gets home just as I'm starting to wrap up my freelance stuff. We tell each other about our days, chill on the couch with the pup, and watch a couple episodes of (He protests, but I know he secretly doesn't hate it – who would? It's a GOOD show!) Then we head to bed, exhausted. Daily Total: $32",7,275
"7:30 a.m. — I wake up slowly this morning. My boyfriend, M., usually leaves for work around the same time as me, but he has early mornings on Tuesdays and is out the door before I even open my eyes. I find it easier to get ready when I have the apartment to myself, so I take the opportunity to doze later than I usually do. 8 a.m. — Okay, I dozed a bit longer than I meant to. I quickly throw on clean clothes, chug a glass of water with lemon, make a Nespresso, and head out the door to work. 9:15 a.m. — I make it to the metro station and realize my Opus card has demagnetized and wiped my monthly pass. This is a bit unfortunate, because it's only mid-month and a monthly pass costs $85. I decide to deal with it later, and buy a one-way pass just to get myself to work. It's kind of a long commute to my office, but I always have a book with me, so I don't mind. Right now I'm reading by Anthony Bourdain. $3 10 a.m. — Arrive at the office and immediately make another coffee. We have free Keurig and Nespresso pods here, which my wallet is eternally grateful for. I also munch on a freebie Clif Bar from the kitchen. I didn't have time to eat before leaving home, and I never skip breakfast! 11:30 a.m. — I was recently promoted to Managing Editor at the publication I work for. While I'm based in Montreal, the main office is in New York, and I find myself traveling back and forth a lot to coordinate with the team there. I decide to apply for a Nexus trusted traveler card to make airport security less of a headache. To complete the application, I have to write down the addresses of every apartment I've lived in over the last five years, which makes me realize I've moved a lot! $50 1 p.m. — A few of my coworkers are going to grab lunch at an izakaya next to our office. I tag along and order gyozas, a bowl of ramen, and a small Sapporo. I have psoriasis, so I usually try to avoid gluten (which irritates it), but I can't say no to noodles and a cold draft on a rainy afternoon. $30 4 p.m. — Even though I've had office jobs my entire professional life, I still find it hard to remain focused while sitting at a desk all day. Sometimes I get up and go for a quick walk around the office, but today I opt for a walk to the café around the corner for a soy latte and a vegan peanut butter brownie. $8 6:15 p.m. — Home time! I head to the metro and hope my Opus card will magically work this time, but no such luck. I buy another one-way pass and head home. I'll deal with my Opus card on the weekend. $3 7 p.m. — Ah, I love walking through the door after a long day at work. As an introvert, there's nothing better than having a few hours completely alone to recharge. I pour myself a glass of wine, dig the vegan brownie out of my backpack, and put on last night's episode of . (Don't @ me! A little mindless TV helps me unwind.) 8 p.m. — I check my emails and get a little freelance work in before M. comes home. Although I'm a full-time magazine editor, I still enjoy freelance writing on the side. My current freelance beat is food and restaurant reviews, and I love it. I live in one of the food capitals of Canada and will take any excuse to dine out more frequently! 9:15 p.m. — M. gets home from work and we prepare dinner together. He works in finance and always gets home pretty late. We prepare a kale salad with smoked tofu, various vegetables, flax seeds, and a dijon apple cider vinegar dressing. 10 p.m. — I make a cup of slippery elm tea (it's supposed to help with psoriasis) and we lazily sink into the couch while watching – which is basically Canada's answer to . I start to doze off and M. suggests we crawl into bed. Daily Total: $94",1,276
"8 a.m. — It's spring, but it snowed all night! My office is super relaxed about taking snow days, so I decide to work from home. I don't have to log on until 10 a.m., so I allow myself to snooze a bit longer. 9:30 a.m. — It's still snowing! I can't believe it. It has felt so much like summer lately and I really thought we were out of the woods. Sigh. I log on, check my emails, and continue working on a brainstorm that I'm going over with my team tomorrow. 10:30 a.m. — I make myself a glass of warm water with lemon and a glass of fresh pressed celery juice, which I drink while watching the news and cuddling with my cats. Then I make myself a Nespresso and get back to work on my brainstorm. Some of the editors at work let me know that they're also working from home. I'm still adjusting to being a manager and sometimes forget that people have to report to me! 12:30 p.m. — I'm getting hungry and decide to order a pizza and take my lunch a bit early. I order a gluten-free vegan pizza with pineapple, jalapeño, and pesto. I pour myself a glass of wine (work-from-home perks!) and dig in while watching on Netflix. $19.25 3:30 p.m. — M. texts me to let me know he's leaving work early – a pleasant surprise! He lets me know that he's picked up celeriac and mushrooms and will be taking care of dinner tonight! 5 p.m. — I power through the last few hours of work and punctuate my day by browsing Amazon. I order a book about natural wine and a tub of magnesium chloride, which is supposed to help clear up psoriasis. I've had pretty bad psoriasis for a few years now and am constantly trying new natural remedies and supplements. The cost adds up quickly, which is unfortunate. I wish Kim Kardashian would share her psoriasis-fighting tips! $56.33 6 p.m. — I check my email one last time and log off for the night. I have a bad habit of checking my email at all hours, but I try to make a conscious effort to have quiet time every night. M. and I open a bottle of wine and we hang out while he prepares dinner. Since we're already in the kitchen, I decide to make energy balls to get me through the rest of the week and my upcoming flight to New York. 8:30 p.m. — After lazily cooking for nearly three hours, we sit down to honeyed carrots, marinated mushrooms, a heaping kale salad, and sliced celeriac and radishes with vegan caviar and sour cream. It's quite the feast! I'm very lucky that M. loves cooking. We've been together for six years and his culinary skills have only gotten better. 9:45 p.m. — We move to the couch to watch an old rerun before I head off to bed. My boss from New York is coming to the Montreal office tomorrow morning and I want to get in nice and early to prepare for her arrival. Daily Total: $75.58",2,276
"6:30 a.m. — I toss and turn all night. I have a bad habit of listening to on Netflix while falling asleep... I find the narrator's voice so soothing, but sometimes, unsurprisingly, it gives me awful nightmares! I make a mental note to finally download Headspace instead and then allow myself to fall back asleep for a bit longer. 7:30 a.m. — I reluctantly hop out of bed and chug a lemon water and a celery juice. I'll get coffee (and a free granola bar) when I get to work. I quickly throw on an easy go-to outfit, wash my face, fix my hair, and head out the door after kissing M. and my cats goodbye. 8 a.m. — There's no way I'm making it to the office on time if I take the metro now. I decide to Uber, even though it will cost me a fortune to drive crosstown. I don't Uber that often, though, so this one time is fine. $27.59 8:35 a.m. — I make it to the office after a winding drive (Montreal construction sometimes makes it hard to navigate!). Thankfully, my colleague from New York hasn't arrived yet and I'm  the first one here. I make myself a Keurig coffee and tidy up the spare desk that we keep for visitors. 12 p.m. — My colleague arrives and we head out for a team lunch at a cool brasserie down the street. We split a bottle of wine ($70) and order a bunch of different bites to share ($85). I'm usually the one to expense team lunches, but since my boss is in town, she takes care of it. 2 p.m. — We head back to the office to finish out the day. I contemplate picking up a cold brew on our walk back but settle for a Keurig instead. It's not nearly as satisfying but, well, it's free. 3:30 p.m. — I finished my Anthony Bourdain book the other day, and so this afternoon I browse Amazon for something new. I've been reading a lot of nonfiction lately and am craving a light-hearted beach read. I opt for Sophie Kinsella's new one, , and throw in Jen Agg's I to qualify for free shipping. $47.52 5:30 p.m. — My office does flex hours, so since I came in so early, I take the opportunity to duck out a bit sooner than normal. I had plans to meet a friend for dinner and drinks, but she bailed last minute. It doesn't bother me, though. I've been feeling a bit run down and tired this week and am happy to just go home and chill out with my cats. Is that a Taylor Swift lyric? Whoops. 6:30 p.m. — I'm greeted by both of my cats as I walk through the door. I give them each a quick scratch and immediately search for a snack. I remember the energy balls I made last night and grab a couple to munch on while I do a clay mask and text with my mom. After lounging around a bit, I decide to pull out my yoga mat and do a pilates Youtube video. I've been trying so hard to maintain a steady workout routine lately, but I'm finding it really difficult to stick with. I go out of town a lot, and that always breaks my habit. I'm considering traveling with a yoga mat to encourage working out while away from home. 8 p.m. — After I put away my yoga mat, I plop onto my bed and cue up the latest episode of on Netflix. This show seems to pivot plotlines every few episodes but I am shamefully hooked. 9 p.m. — I hop in the shower and start thinking about what I should make for dinner. I'm not very hungry after the huge lunch we had at work, so I pour myself a celery juice and prepare a salad for M. 10:05 p.m. — M. comes home late tonight. Bummer. I chat with him while he eats his salad. Turns out he had a bad day at work, so we each have a Scotch to unwind and talk about our weekend plans before heading to bed. Daily Total: $75.11",3,276
"7 a.m. — I decide to make up for yesterday's late start and jump out of bed without hitting snooze once. I get 20 minutes of at-home pilates in before knocking back a lemon water and celery juice and watching CNN. American news scares me a little bit right now, but I think it's responsible to be informed. I make a Nespresso, check my emails, flick through Instagram, and make a salad and a smoothie to bring to work before I start getting ready. 9:15 a.m. — M. drops me off at the metro and I make my way to work from there. We absolutely love our neighborhood, but it's about a 20-minute walk to the nearest metro station. Lovely in the summertime, but not so great during the snowy-slash-rainy springtime. I try to swipe my faulty Opus card and it magically works again, which is a relief! 9:55 a.m. — My office does free bagel breakfasts on Fridays, but I feel like I've consumed too much gluten this week (and it's irritating my psoriasis), so I stop at the gluten-free bakery across the street and pick up bagels there so I don't feel left out. They don't compare to real Montreal bagels, but they'll do. I keep a bottle of Trader Joe's Everything But The Bagel seasoning at my desk for days like these, which I sprinkle onto the bagel in an attempt to trick my palate into thinking I'm eating the real deal. It kind of works. $5.45 10 a.m. — One of my colleagues arrives with his dog! Day = made. My office does ""dog days,"" where editors can bring their dogs to the office for a visit. It's probably my favorite job perk. 12:30 p.m. — I ordered a vintage Louis Vuitton Mini Speedy bag on eBay last week, and it arrives at the office just in time for the weekend! It shipped from Japan, so I had budgeted for a hefty duty fee, but, pleasant surprise: they don't charge me anything! I've been collecting vintage Louis Vuitton since I was 17. I sometimes justify my purchases by checking the resale value on the particular bag I'm interested in. Even after using a Louis for a few years, I can almost always sell it for more than I paid for it. 1:30 p.m. — I take a quick break from work to put together my salad and bring it back to my desk so I can continue working. I usually make really elaborate salads for lunch and dinner but it's Friday, and our supplies from the weekend are running low. It's mainly semi-wilted kale, cucumber, radish, and flax seeds. I refuse to call it a sad desk lunch, even though it kinda is. 2:45 p.m. — I take another quick break from working to get up and stretch my legs, make a Keurig coffee, and have another half of a gluten-free bagel. The day is flying by and I still have so much to do before I leave for the weekend! 5 p.m. — I finished up most of my work and head out for the day. I usually try to leave the office by 4 on Fridays to make it to my freelance social media consulting gig at 5, but sometimes it doesn't work out. I jump in an Uber and let them know I'm going to be a bit late. $18.96 5:30 p.m. — I arrive at the office and grab a spare desk. I've been helping a pretty big local business get their social media strategy off the ground. I work from 5 to 9 on Fridays and a few hours from home throughout the week. The pay is stellar and the managers have wine and cheese nights most Friday evenings – win! 9 p.m. — I text my friends to see if they're ready to meet up. We're having dinner at one of my all-time favorite restaurants tonight so they can prep me for dogsitting. They have the sweetest shiba inu in the world, and I always take care of her when they go on vacation. M. and I drive to the restaurant and find parking almost immediately. It's free after 9, so we don't have to pay. 9:30 p.m. — The restaurant doesn't take reservations and is notoriously permanently busy, but one of our angelic friends showed up early and requested a table in advance, so we're seated right away once we arrive in a comfy corner booth. We catch up and order a ton of plates to share and a bottle of wine. This restaurant is one of the best in Canada (literally – I think it ranks fourth) and has an excellent wine selection, so we ask the waiter to surprise us with a bottle. 12 a.m. — M. pays for our share of the dinner ($150 for both of us), and then we say goodbye to everyone and head home. We fall asleep almost immediately. Daily Total: $24.41",4,276
"8 a.m. — We wake up and it's absolutely gorgeous outside! You'd have no idea that it was icy and snowy just a few days ago. We decide to take M.'s convertible out for a spin to enjoy the sunshine. 9 a.m. — First stop: coffee. We stop at one of our favorite coffee shops for almond milk lattes and a chocolate chip cookie to share. My treat. $12 9:30 a.m. — We continue onto a plant warehouse we've been meaning to go to. It's about an hour outside of the city but apparently they have the best cactus selection in the surrounding area and we've been wanting to find a cactus for our bedroom. It ends up being a gorgeous drive and we score two cacti – one for us and one for M.'s sister who's having a birthday party tonight. $45 1 p.m. — As we're driving back to the city, we remember that some friends recently bought a house in the town we're driving through. We text them and end up meeting up and enjoying the sun, wine, and a nice catch up session in their sprawling backyard (#goals), before heading back to Montreal. 5 p.m. — Back in Montreal. A new bookstore opened up down the street from our apartment so we pop in for their opening. We end up having a few glasses of complimentary wine and I pick up a Zadie Smith book for M.'s sister's birthday and for me. $31 7:30 p.m. — We head back to our apartment, get ready for M.'s sister's birthday, and head over to her house. It's a “margarita party,” which just literally means everyone is drinking and mixing margs. I'm usually a wine girl, but it turns out to be a fun change of pace. We also eat a ton of guac and chips. M.'s sister is a vegetarian like me, so there's always great snacks at her parties. 12 a.m. — After a fun evening of drinking and dancing, we head home, first stopping to pick up late night veggie dogs at a local 24-hour greasy spoon. $5.80 2 a.m. — We get into bed and fall asleep watching a random comedy show on Netflix. Today was a great day! Daily Total: $93.80",5,276
"8 a.m. — We're up way too early for a Sunday morning, but we booked a tour at an innovative rooftop farm and don't want to miss it. We rush around each other to get ready and then head out the door. It's another absolutely gorgeous day, so we take advantage of it by putting the top down on the convertible. 9 a.m. — The tour ends up being way cooler than we expected. We sign up for their weekly subscription service (no charge to sign up) and score free greens and bananas from the farm! 12 p.m. — M. and I drop the car at home and head out for a day of exploring our neighborhood. It's still sunny and warm, so we want to take advantage of it! First stop: a delicious little taco joint. We each get two tacos, churros, and coffee (my treat), and then continue on walking. $17 1 p.m. — We make it to our favorite farmer's market and pick up groceries for the week ($27). We get extra beers ($6), iced coffee ($5.50), and macarons ($6), and then walk over to the Lachine Canal for an impromptu picnic in the sun. (We split the cost of everything.) $22.25 3 p.m. — I have early drink plans with a friend in a few hours, so we decide to walk back to the apartment so that I can get ready to go. It's about a half hour walk, but we don't mind – the weather has put us both in such a great mood! I silently wonder why we choose to live in a country that's below zero for half the year. 5:30 p.m. — I meet up with my friend, A., at the wine bar around the corner from my apartment. She used to be my boss at my current job, which is hilarious to think about because we have become very close friends since then. We order a bottle of wine ($70) and appetizers ($20) and catch up. We both travel often for work and for pleasure, so we always have new stories to share. (We split the cost.) $45 7:30 p.m. — A. takes an Uber to meet her mom for dinner and I walk home. I still have to pack for my work trip to New York tomorrow and get to bed. I'm leaving for the airport at a seriously unholy hour. 9 p.m. — I'm finally all packed and in bed with my book. I read for a little bit and try to fall asleep as quickly as possible. Daily Total: $84.25",6,276
"4 a.m. — I'm up super early to make my flight to NYC. I double check that I have everything, kiss M. goodbye, and head outside to wait for the car service to pick me up and take me to the airport. 6 a.m. — After a 45-minute wait, I'm finally though security. (This is why I need a Nexus pass!!!) At this point I'm starving, so I pick up an iced Americano from Starbucks, a Clif Bar, and a Smartwater. My skin becomes super sensitive and dry when I fly (thanks, psoriasis), so I try to stay as hydrated as possible. $14 6:15 a.m. — I'm exhausted from my early start, so I take the opportunity to snooze during the flight. 9:30 a.m. — Made it to JFK! I pick up a juice ($6) before getting into the Uber to the city ($65). I don't know what it is about NYC, but every time I visit I end up eating way too much pizza, so I try to counterbalance it with greens as much as I can. ($71 expensed) 11 a.m. — It takes forever to get to my hotel. I quickly change my clothes and store my luggage. Then I head out, load my MetroCard with $10, and take the subway to the office. ($10 expensed) 11:30 a.m. — I get to the office and say hi to my NY-based colleagues. Then I run to their kitchen to get a cold brew. The New York office has cold brew on tap! It may be my favorite thing about visiting. 12 p.m. — I was supposed to have lunch with my colleagues, but I'm interviewing a potential new editor in an hour and don't want to be late to meet with them. I decide to run to Whole Foods and pick up a quick salad. I remember one of my colleagues' birthday is tomorrow, so I also pick up a cute little birthday cake for him. ($16.75 expensed) 1 p.m. — I meet with the first candidate for the job. The interview goes well and we find out we're heading to the same press event later this week! I guess New York is smaller than I thought! 5 p.m. — I head out a bit earlier than I would if I was working from Montreal. I was up at 4 this morning and want to try and take a quick nap and shower before the event I have tonight. 5:30 p.m. — Back at my hotel, I contemplate going out to try and find pizza, but I order ramen from Seamless instead and slurp it quickly while getting ready. One of my old friends from Canada is hosting a Scotch-tasting press event tonight and invited me to check it out. I'm bringing another Canadian expat who I haven't seen in a few years. Although I'm exhausted, it should be a fun night! ($23 expensed) 7 p.m. — I decide to walk to the event from my hotel rather than take the subway to see some NYC sights. I don't know if I could ever live here (I am a Montrealaise through and through), but I always love taking in everything the city has to offer while I'm here. 7:30 p.m. — I meet up with my friends, S. and K., and head into the event. It's already full of editors and influencers, but there are plenty of Scotch cocktails to go around. 9:30 p.m. — After a super informative Scotch tasting, S. and I say goodbye to K. and head out to find pizza. We're a little tipsy after all the Scotch and still have plenty to talk about, so we grab two slices each (my treat) and find a stoop to continue our catch up. $12 10:30 p.m. — I hate to call it a night, but I have work tomorrow. I say goodbye to S. and head back to my hotel. I decide to stop at a deli along the way and pick up a coconut water and a granola bar for the morning. Then I fall asleep watching American Netflix (the selection in Canada is surprisingly very different!). $3.50 Daily Total: $29.50",7,276
"8 a.m. — I wake up and head to the library across the street from my house. I'm prepping for an exam later this week, so I'm trying to get earlier hours in! Grab a croissant from my kitchen on my way out and then grab a coffee from a machine downstairs! $1.18 1 p.m. — Finish up the preliminary notes and head to the grocery store. It's not the cheapest, but it has quite good weekend hours, which is tough to find in South Tyrol. I get a soup bag, salad makings, fancy cheese, bread, tofu, and Tupperware. I've been trying to go at least two to three times a week for groceries and get small portions, otherwise I tend to waste so much food. I have quite hungry eyes – Italy has the best cheeses! I run into a friend walking home, and he invites me to a BBQ tomorrow at the top of the mountain. I am amped! I love his group of friends and I am keen to meet more of them. $24.72 3 p.m. — Since I share a communal kitchen with eight other people, I tend to prep meals at odd hours. I make a veggie soup with tofu and pasta that should last me the rest of the weekend. 9 p.m. — Go to an Austrian-style beer garden and meet up with three friends from school. Last week was my birthday, so a friend brings me a huge Kinder egg! Winning. It's delicious and has a white chocolate filling. I split it up and share with the crew. 1 a.m. — Get two beers and tip $1 since our server is a delight. (Tipping is not common here, and sometimes can be perceived as rude.) I chat with my friends about our respective travel plans. We're all in the same graduate program, so we're discussion our future plans. Two of my friends are definitely on the PhD track, but I'm still quite on the fence about it. It's a lovely night outside, and we take a walk following drinks. $11.49 Daily Total: $37.39",1,277
"8 a.m. — Library again in the morning. The library here is so relaxing – I really enjoy spending time here even if it's prepping for a killer exam. I purchase a cappuccino from the café and drink it with pane di stelle cookies I brought from home. I've adapted to the coffee lifestyle and have become quite addicted! $1.78 1 p.m. — I make a quick cheese sandwich with tuna at home and then walk to the store to grab wine to bring. I have no concept of nice wine, so I choose based on the bottle. I walk to the gondola half a mile from my house, which I take to the top of the mountain using my transportation pass, and meet up with my friends. I recently got into my Spotify-recommended playlist, and this time, it's on point! I jam on the walk. Once I arrive, I meet up with the PhD crew. One of my professors is here with her children, which is super nice. The sun is shining and it's looking like a great Sunday. $8.29 8 p.m. — For dinner, I eat some of the soup I made yesterday. Then I catch up with my mom on the phone for an hour and a half. She gives me a pump up speech and encourages me since I'm starting to write my master's thesis, which can feel quite strenuous at times! I have to buy more Skype credit so I can reach her. $5.92 Daily Total: $15.99",2,277
"10 a.m. — Library again! Though I do get a bit of a later start this morning. I grab a granola bar and tea on my way. The organization I volunteer with in Berlin wants to build a new workspace for the members, so I make a donation for funding the website. It's an integration organization for newly arrived immigrants, and they do awesome work. Since I have not been able to be there IRL, I try to catch up with their going-ons via Facebook. $14 1 p.m. — I meet up with a new friend. We chat about where she's living, which is in the mountains! So cool. I treat her to coffee. She's such a free spirit and she reminds me that it's only an exam tomorrow. I enjoy her perspective, as she already finished her PhD. $4.03 1:45 p.m. — Run home and grab my salad lunch before going to my lab for two hours. 3 p.m. — When I head home, a friend from school joins me to study. As we go through the question, I make pasta with pesto. I add salad and tomatoes to the side. This exam will be quite rough, so we're cramming through the notes. 10 p.m. — Down the wormhole of Quora. I end up on the strangest things, none of which include prep for tomorrow's exam. I'm asleep by 1 a.m. Daily Total: $18.03",3,277
"7:40 a.m. — Wake up in a total panic since the exam is at 8:30. Grab a coffee from the machine and then run to the exam room across the street. The exam is fairly reasonable. I'm sure I passed, but not sure by how much. I rush out of class so that I don't hear the answers – I don't want to know what I got wrong! $1.18 12:45 p.m. — Go to the cafeteria and take a lunch. It's a mixed veggie stir-fry with salad and a drink. The cafeteria here is highly subsidized by the government, which makes the food much cheaper! And since I'm a grad student, there are further discounts! Yay, student life. I eat everything in five minutes. Exam day hunger! $3.43 1 p.m. — Rush out and buy cards for my boyfriend's mom, aunt, and sister. They took me on a ski trip last week in Switzerland and I want to thank them. $9.12 6 p.m. — I do a huge load of laundry. My boyfriend is arriving tonight and I need to clean my clothes before he gets here. The way the system works is you pay for a day's load and can do it throughout a 24-hour period. It's often booked, so I do it at odd times (not on weekends). I'm slightly afraid of the machines, as they shrank my clothes so intensely last time, so I hang/attempt to air dry them in my shower area (which sort of works). I pop down, back, and down again to get the finished load. I feel like the woman at reception is so tired of me! $7.11 9 p.m. — My boyfriend arrives from Germany! To celebrate, I buy us two large pizzas. They are so delicious! The pizza crust is super thin and absolutely divine. I pick them up and bring them to my house. He arrives with two beers and we feast. The night is followed with on Netflix. It is so captivating! I love the anti-hero/hero dynamic. I also love hearing Spanish! $17.41 Daily Total: $38.25",4,277
"10 a.m. — I wake up for my lab today. We're doing a systematic literature review. The topic is interesting, but sometimes the lack of standardization in the input can be a struggle. My boyfriend meets me after the lab and we do a grocery haul. We get pasta, soup makings, salad, and veggie burgers. He buys, since I got food last time in Berlin. 3 p.m. — We're going to visit my sister in Bologna today! I grab our train tickets and my boyfriend slides me $20! The trains out of Bozen are always on time, and we almost miss our transfer in Verona. We eat some of the snacks from the earlier haul and I pass out so hard. The exam stress really got me tired. $23.75 10 p.m. — My sister meets us at the Bologna station! We get orange spritzes for the road. She gets the first round and I get the second. We walk through the city with our plastic cups. I love Italy! She's just moved into a new place and it's beautiful! She used to live in a tiny flat, but now she has an awesome balcony. $9.48 1 a.m. — After the drinks, we're all feeling quite hangry, so we grab pizzas. They're $2.50 each and huge, so I save part of mine for later. I buy the pizzas for everyone. $8.88 Daily Total: $42.11",5,277
"10 a.m. — My sister makes eggs, coffee, and salad for breakfast. She's an awesome cook. 1 p.m. — We go into Bologna proper and walk around. The city is so full of life. We stop for tortellini. I get mine with cheese and butter. It's delicious and also the only vegetarian option! $10.07 5 p.m. — After walking around for the better part of the day, we head to my sister's for a little siesta. She invited friends over for tonight, and my boyfriend is going to whip up Thai stir-fry for everyone, since he's a great cook. He decides to use black rice. It's wholemeal and so good! I sneak in a little studying before they arrive, and my boyfriend grabs the groceries. OMG peanut butter is insanely expensive here... Almost $10 for a tiny jar! #imports 8 p.m. — I buy rum for the guests, and we make mojitos and sit on the balcony. It really feels like summer. We blast Italian rock music and Falco (old school!). We eat the delicious food my BF made and even dance a bit! $16.58 2 a.m. — We walk downtown. The streets are insane! They are completely crowded and slightly overwhelming. I buy a beer since I am already feeling the mojitos quite hard. We continue bar-hopping until the friends need to catch their train. I'm so happy I met them. $3.55 Daily Total: $30.20",6,277
"11 a.m. — We have a later start today after the fun festivities last night. I make toast for everyone. I have a hangover from the sweet drinks and go back to bed for two hours after prepping breakfast. 3 p.m. — We finally leave the house and go to a farmer's market. Everything smells delicious! We each buy $1 scratch tickets and I win $7! Then we get gelato. I get lemon and strawberry, which slightly helps my hangover. $2.37 8 p.m. — Head back to my sister's and eat the leftovers from last night. I still feel so yucky! No more mojitos for me! Daily Total: $2.37",7,277
"7:30 a.m. — After snoozing for 30 minutes, I finally drag myself out of bed. I'm definitely not a morning person, and getting up is always hard for me. It doesn't help that my husband has a later start than I do. 7:45 a.m. — I am a big believer in breakfast, and hardly ever leave the house without eating. I grab a cup of low-fat yogurt and mix in chocolate granola. I wash it down with a small glass of fresh squeezed OJ, followed by water and my vitamin D tablet and L-Lysine pills. I recently had a full physical done and my doctor said I was vitamin D-deficient and that my good (HDL) cholesterol levels were low, so I've been making a real effort to improve my diet and up those levels. 8:20 a.m. — Arrive at work and immediately grab a cup of water from our office water filter. I try to always have water at my desk and sip it throughout the day. 10:30 a.m. — Ponder going downstairs to the coffee place in my building for a latte, but remind myself that I did this yesterday and am trying not to make it a habit. I go for some free Earl Grey tea that we have stocked in the office instead. I brought a small bag of walnuts from home and munch on these as well. Apparently walnuts have lots of that good cholesterol that I'm lacking. 11:30 a.m. — Head out on my lunch break to pick up my dry cleaning, only to discover it's not ready yet. Bummer. Decide to pop into a nearby Sephora and pick up this eye cream I like that was out of stock online, but apparently is in stock at this particular store. Today is just not my day — the store is out of stock as well. The salesperson is really nice and offers to call me when it's back in stock. I leave with a couple free samples of other products I've been eyeing. I'm kind of a skincare/makeup junkie… 12:30 p.m. — Back at my desk, I eat a salad that I brought from home with pesto chicken, tomatoes, cucumbers, bell peppers, feta, and avocado (another great source of HDL cholesterol!). 2:30 p.m. — I meet with a group of about nine girls I work with to try to collectively win at HQ Trivia today. The prize is $300,000, and we've actually won as a group in the past ($12 each), so hopes are high! 3:30 p.m. — We didn't win :'( Oh well. Now I'm drained and in need of sugar. Luckily, I came prepared with a healthy option — a mix of raspberries, blackberries, and strawberries. I'm really into berries. They hit the spot. 4:30 p.m. — I leave work a little early to meet a woman who's interested in buying a faux cowhide rug I'm selling on OfferUp. Hopefully the sale goes through! I get such a high from reselling stuff. Before we moved from Amsterdam, I tried reselling most things we weren't taking along in our move, and I was pleasantly surprised by how easy it was to get rid of stuff and earn cash. Now I try to keep up the habit. 5 p.m. — Aaaand she ghosted me. There were other people interested in the rug, so I start contacting them. 6:15 p.m. — Head to a spin class to get some cardio in. Since I moved to Houston, my sister has gotten me into spinning. I used to be a yoga-only kind of girl, but now I really enjoy mixing it up with a high energy, bass-thumping spin class. I try to do two yoga classes and one spin class a week. Keyword: “try.” I have a couple classes left from a class pack I bought last month, so no charge for this one. 7:30 p.m. — And I've got a bite on the rug! Someone is on his way now to pick it up. Hooray! I quickly shower and meet the dude to make the exchange (+$40). 8 p.m. — My husband, D., and I have been trying to cook more during the week, so he whips us up a pasta with salmon and spinach for dinner. He's definitely the cook in our household. I'm okay at the basics, but I just don't feel very comfortable in the kitchen. We follow a “you cook, I clean” method, which works out swimmingly. 8:45 p.m. — Tomorrow my sister-in-law and her husband are visiting us from Amsterdam! We're super excited for their visit and plan out our weekend with them while sipping green tea. 9 p.m. — I decide to quickly pop chocolate chip muffins (from a box mix, I admit) into the oven, so we have a sweet treat for our company upon their arrival tomorrow. 10 p.m. — I start my nighttime skincare routine a bit early because I'm so excited to use my new Clinique Sonic Cleansing Brush. I just got it yesterday, and after using it only once, I could already feel a difference in my skin. I use it with a gentle foaming cleanser and follow up with a retinol serum, eye cream, and moisturizer. 10:30 p.m. — Fall asleep relishing in the fact that I had a no-spend day! I learned about no-spend days in another Money Diary, and am now trying not to spend money for one day a week. Daily Total: $0",1,278
"7:15 a.m. — I snooze only once today, which I consider to be a win. 7:35 a.m. — For breakfast, I toast a whole wheat English muffin and top it with peanut butter and banana slices. One of the things I missed most about the U.S. when living abroad was peanut butter — Jif specifically. I probably eat it about three times a week. 8:15 a.m. — Settle in at my desk and grab a water. 9:35 a.m. — I can't stop yawning. I go downstairs for a vanilla latte. No regrets. $3.77 11:30 a.m. — Round two of dry cleaning pickup. This time it's a success. This is actually the first time I've gotten dry cleaning done since we moved here late last year. It's basically all my cashmere. $30.82 11:45 a.m. — Stop by CVS to pick up cotton eye pads. I cut these in half at home so they last longer. $3.30 12 p.m. — I've got an appointment with my brow girl to get my eyebrows waxed. She does a great job. $36 12:30 p.m. — Back at my desk, I start on my lunch that I brought from home, which is a salad made with leftover salmon from dinner, tomatoes, cucumbers, bell pepper, and my trusty avocado. 2 p.m. — The eagle has landed! Eagle being my sister-in-law and her husband. Neither D. nor I can take off from work early today to pick them up from the airport, so they Uber to our apartment and the doorman lets them in. 2:30 p.m. — Feeling a little hungry, so I snack on trail mix I have in my purse. 4:15 p.m. — Before heading home, I stop by my favorite blow dry bar for a blowout. I have really thick, semi-unruly hair, and I just want to have good hair this weekend. I am grateful for my hair, but it is a pain in the a** to style. Also, I love to be pampered. I have a Groupon that I bought last week, so I only need to tip today. $10 5:15 p.m. — Reunited with my sister-in-law and her husband, and it feels so good! We catch up over drinks at our place. 7:30 p.m. — We hit up our favorite neighborhood spot for Tex-Mex. We share quesadillas and tacos, with a round of margaritas. D. picks up the tab for the group. $84.08 Daily Total: $167.97",2,278
"8 a.m. — D. and I both take the day off to spend with our guests, but I have a gynecologist appointment later this morning. I wake up feeling anxious and stressed about it. In the Netherlands, they don't do annual pap smears/well-women exams until the age of 30. I just turned 30 a couple months ago, so I actually haven't had a check-up in five years. Cue the anxiety. 9 a.m. — D. whips up eggs and bacon for everyone. I manage to get a couple bites down, but my nerves are getting the best of me. I mention how nervous I am, and D. offers to drop me off at my appointment so I don't have to drive and figure out parking (which can be difficult where this doctor's office is). 10:45 a.m. — We all pile in D.'s car. The crew gives me a pep talk in the car, and I try to do breathing exercises. 11:30 a.m. — After waiting for what feels like an eternity, I finally get called back. The appointment goes better than I expect. The nurse and doctor are great and really help put me at ease. 12 p.m. — The team picks me up, and we all go to lunch at a cute spot with a big patio. D. and I share a Greek salad and a gyro. Thankfully, my appetite is back. D.'s sister and her husband take care of the bill. 2 p.m. — We walk to a nearby Gap so our visitors can go shopping — the prices here in the U.S. are so much cheaper than in Europe. Basically everything is on sale, and I end up grabbing a cute sundress and a graphic tee, plus D. gets two button-downs. The salesclerk tempts me with an additional 20% off if I open a Gap credit card. I take the bait. $73.36 3 p.m. — After a few hours of shopping in an outdoor mall, we pass a Susie Cakes, and I just have to go inside. I've heard great things about this place. I get a mini cupcake for each of us, but end up eating both mine and D.'s. Oops. $8 4 p.m. — Back at our place, the guys go down to our building's pool with a couple beers. Sister-in-law and I decide to both take naps inside. I get snuggles from my kitty. 6 p.m. — We all meet my sister and a couple friends out for happy hour. I have a gin cocktail followed by a glass of rosé. D. and I pick up the tab for the four of us. $90 8 p.m. — We quickly make a reservation for our entire group of eight at a nearby semi-swanky restaurant. I get the steak tartare, and we all have a great time. D. and I pay for our share. $92 10 p.m. — The good times are rolling, and we head to a new bar. I have a gin and tonic, and then one of our friends comes around with a tray of shots described as “upscale Fireball.” It's actually pretty tasty, and I am definitely feeling tipsy at this point. Someone in the group settles the bill, and we go to yet another bar. 12 a.m. — We arrive at a rooftop bar and the cover is a staggering $20 each, but we decide to bite the bullet and head in ($40 for me and D.). The place is rocking, and I dance the night away with a vodka cranberry, definitely not thinking about all the different liquors I've already had tonight. $60 2 a.m. — We Uber home, I quickly shower, and hop in bed. $4 Daily Total: $327.36",3,278
"11 a.m. — Considering the amount of alcohol I consumed last night, I feel pretty okay. We all get up and take turns showering, since we're meeting my sister and parents for lunch soon. 11:30 a.m. — I get a text from a girl saying it was nice to meet me last night. I have a habit of making friends at bars. I laugh and text her back. 12:30 p.m. — My parents want to give our visitors a real Texan experience, so we meet them at an award-winning barbeque joint. I get a pulled pork sandwich that really hits the spot. Gotta love grease to combat a hangover. My parents graciously treat us all to lunch. 2:30 p.m. — D. got tickets to the Astros game for the four of us. We Uber to the stadium to avoid parking. This is actually everyone's first baseball game ever (except for mine), so the group is very excited. $6 3 p.m. — I try to explain the rules while we munch on popcorn and guzzle beers that D.'s sister got for us. Unfortunately the ‘Stros lose, but it was a good game and fun experience. 6 p.m. — We walk to a nearby rooftop bar with great views of downtown. I have a lemony cocktail and we share fries. D. picks up the bill for all of us. $56 8 p.m. — We're all pretty exhausted after our shenanigans last night and busy day today. We decide to Uber to a low-key café near our house for dinner. $5 8:30 p.m. — D. and I share a soup and salad. Trying to balance out all the junk food and drinks from earlier. $25 9 p.m. — We walk home, and I crash soon after we arrive. Looking forward to a long night's sleep. Daily Total: $92",4,278
"10:30 a.m. — I feel like I slept a solid 12 hours. It's so great. I toast myself an English muffin and top it with peanut butter and banana. 12 p.m. — It's a beautiful day, and we decide to drive to Kemah Boardwalk, which is kind of like a mini theme park on the coast. My sister meets us at our house to tag along. 2 p.m. — After the 45-minute drive, we're all starving. We put our names down for a table on the pier at a seafood place. In the meantime, I get tickets for everyone to ride the wooden roller coaster next door with me, except for my sister-in-law, who doesn't do rides. This roller coaster is actually a lot more intense than I thought it would be. We all exit the ride with tears streaming down our faces, and my sister curses at me. $26 2:30 p.m. — Our table is ready, and we are starved. It's crawfish season here in Texas, so we order a huge bucket for the table. My sister-in-law is kind of creeped out, but her husband has a blast peeling and eating the little buggers. I probably scarf down a full pound. D.'s sister and her husband cover the bill. 3:30 p.m. — We walk around the boardwalk, soaking up the sun and sea air. Once everyone has had enough, we drive back home. 5 p.m. — It's still beautiful out, so we head to the pool to relax. My sister heads home. 8 p.m. — We decide to go to dinner at our favorite sushi place. We don't normally eat out this much, but we like to make an exception when we have company staying with us. Houston has so much great food to offer. The four of us share a bottle of wine with edamame, sashimi, and a few rolls. We split the bill. $115 10:30 p.m. — Not looking forward to going into the office tomorrow. After a jam-packed weekend, I know I'll be exhausted. I hit the hay and hope for sleep to come quickly. Daily Total: $141",5,278
"7 a.m. — I had a restless night's sleep, so I'm feeling pretty grumpy this morning. I get ready for work and decide to pick up breakfast on my way in. Our company is sleeping on the sofa bed in the living room, and I don't want to wake them while making breakfast. 7:45 a.m. — I stop at a juice bar and get an acaí bowl topped with banana, strawberries, and granola. $9.47 8:15 a.m. — It's gonna be a rough day. I grab a water and get stuck in emails. 12 p.m. — I meet a good friend for lunch at our favorite coffee spot. I get a latte, cup of tomato basil soup, and a pistachio croissant. This place has the best pastries in Houston (in my opinion), and I cannot go here without getting something sweet. $14.23 3:30 p.m. — Struggling to make it through this day. All I want to do is go home and sleep. It's our last night with D.'s sister and her husband, and we're having dinner at home. I am so glad they came to visit, but could really use a night alone at this point. Hosting is draining, amirite? 5 p.m. — On my way home, I stop by the store to pick up a bottle of wine and a card for my coworker's birthday tomorrow. It's a gift from our entire team, so my boss said I could expense it ($16.96). I also grab stuff for the house: toilet paper, milk, yogurt, a box of mac and cheese, Amy's Pad Thai, butternut squash spirals, avocado, chicken breast, and Nutella. A weird assortment of groceries, I know. I normally like to come to the store armed with a grocery list, but I just wasn't prepared today, so I end up with a hodge-podge of stuff. $31.44 7:30 p.m. — Happy to be staying in for dinner after a few days of indulging and eating out. My sister-in-law and her husband kindly offer to make dinner for us. We have a pasta with chorizo and a tomato sauce. Simple and tasty. We reminisce on the past few days and talk about when we will see each other again, which will most likely be Christmas. 10:30 p.m. — I hit the hay and take melatonin to hopefully ensure a better night's sleep. Daily Total: $55.14",6,278
"7:15 a.m. — I roll out of bed and start getting ready. Our guests have a flight to catch this morning, so I can eat breakfast at home without the risk of waking them up. I have a bowl of yogurt with raspberries, blackberries, and chocolate granola. 8:15 a.m. — Arrive at work and grab a cup of water. 10 a.m. — For some reason I'm feeling hungry already. I snack on the trail mix I have in my purse. 12 p.m. — I venture back to Sephora because the eye cream I was looking for last week is back in stock! It feels like a deal because I have a small remaining balance on a gift card. $24.79 12:30 p.m. — Back at my desk, I start on my lunch. I made a salad last night with tomatoes, cucumbers, olives, avocado, and feta cheese. 3 p.m. — The salad didn't really do it for me, so when my coworker says she's making a Chick-fil-A run, I ask her to grab me a six-pack of nuggets. I kind of have a thing for nuggets. My cat's name is essentially “chicken nugget” in Dutch. I asked my coworker how much I owe her, and she says a million dollars. Well thanks, friend! 5:15 p.m. — I forgot that I signed up to participate in a chocolate chip cookie bake-off at work tomorrow. I run by the store to get supplies for my favorite brown butter cookie recipe: flour, vanilla extract, walnuts, butter, chocolate chips, and baking soda. $19.63 5:45 p.m. — While my butter is softening to room temperature, I decide to clean the house. Having guests over is fun, but it's nice to have the house back to normal. Looking forward to alone time with D. tonight. He comes home while I'm in the middle of vacuuming and goes for a run. Once the house is tidied up, I start on the cookies. 7:30 p.m. — Even though I've already eaten a substantial amount of cookie dough, I decide it's probably a good idea to eat dinner. I warm up tomato basil soup and serve it with garlic bread. D. and I eat while watching . I forgot how funny that movie is! 8:30 p.m. — The cookies turn out perfectly! Feeling good about tomorrow. D. agrees that they are delicious. 10 p.m. — I start on my nighttime routine, excited to tuck in early. D. and I snuggle and read in bed together before lights out. Daily Total: $44.42",7,278
"7:45 a.m. — Time to wake up! I'm one of those people who wakes up immediately when their alarm goes off. I lay out my clothes the night before, usually to save time in the morning. I brush my teeth, throw on some makeup, and grab a Greek yogurt to eat at work. I'm loving Chobani's rebrand. 8:15 a.m. — Get on the subway to work. My commute is around 25 minutes, and I usually read the entire way (if I can grab a seat). Right now I'm reading by Roxane Gay. 8:45 a.m. — I arrive at my office a bit early, so I run over to Gregory's and grab a large iced coffee. $4.56 9:10 a.m. — I forgot that on Mondays my office serves catered breakfast, so I put my Greek yogurt in the fridge and grab a breakfast burrito. It's subpar, but I douse it in Sriracha. 12:45 p.m. — Get falafel for lunch with two coworkers. I used to be a very picky eater, so I only recently tried it, and now I'm hooked. I grab a Diet Coke, too. My New Year's resolution was to quit Diet Coke, but I just went from a few cans a day to one or two a week. Pick your poison, right? $11.63 5:15 p.m. — Done with work! I just started my current job a few weeks ago. I head home and make myself cauliflower fried rice and grilled chicken. This guy I went on a second date with last week asks if I want to come to Hoboken, but I'm pretty set on staying in, and even more set on avoiding the PATH train. 8 p.m. — Smoke a bowl and then start the first episode of with my roommates. 11 p.m. — I always lay out my clothes for the next day the night before, which seems childish, but it's actually a huge time-saver. I go through my skincare routine (Mario Badescu face wash, Clinique toner, and Klairs Freshly Juiced Vitamin C Serum) before falling asleep to an episode of the podcast . Daily Total: $16.19",1,279
"7:45 a.m. — Wake up slightly before my alarm, unsure of what time it is. My room faces an alley, so I get no natural light. I'm moving next month, and this is the main reason why. I make myself oatmeal and throw in a banana and brown sugar. 11:05 a.m. — Working on a difficult research report at work, and I'm struck by what we call “analysis paralysis.” I go for a walk. 11:45 a.m. — I've been wanting a pair of high-waisted light wash jeans for ages, and & Other Stories is having a sale, so I splurge. I live in black high-waisted jeans, so I'm unsure If I'll be able to pull these off, but I guess I'll find out. $68.30 1:45 p.m. — Per usual, I take a late lunch. I find that taking my lunch later helps break up my day. I usually like eating alone, so I grab a sandwich at a nearby deli and read my book. $8.14 2:15 p.m. — I get a text from this guy T. who I met on Bumble confirming that we're on for tonight. I suggest a craft beer bar near my apartment. It has dim lighting, which is always a plus. We vibe really well over text, but I've learned the hard way that that's never a guarantee the date will go well. 6 p.m. — Getting stressed before my date. I have a glass of rosé at my apartment with my roommate to calm my nerves. I'm both a year-round iced coffee drinker and a year-round rosé drinker. 9:15 p.m. — Shocked at how well the date went. We ended up each having three beers and splitting an appetizer. I offered to split, but he graciously paid. I make a mental note to insist on paying next time. 10 p.m. — I'm still hungry, so I heat up Trader Joe's edamame before bed. Daily Total: $76.44",2,279
"8 a.m. — Wake up slightly hungover. Gross. I get the worst hangovers, and I can't even be upset because I do it to myself! I resist the urge to grab a bagel on my way to work and instead make an egg scramble with green peppers, onion, and tomato. 1 p.m. — I have an eye doctor appointment near my office. In order to buy contacts, you need a prescription from the last year, which I frankly find ridiculous, because my prescription hasn't changed in five years or so. I go ahead and purchase a year's supply, which is partially covered by insurance. $152.42 6 p.m. — I leave work and take the subway to DeKalb Market Hall, a food court in Brooklyn, where I'm meeting an old coworker before we see Lorde perform later tonight. I buy pierogies and an Other Half IPA. I'm a huge beer fan, and I love the craft beer selection in NYC. I buy a beer for my friend, too, because she's in between jobs. $27.28 9 p.m. — Lorde comes out! The crowd goes wild. Jack Antonoff ends up coming out, and they play ""New York"" by St. Vincent together. He's a fuck boy, but you could cut the sexual tension with a bread knife. 11:45 p.m. — Getting on a train at Barclays is a nightmare. I wait for 10 minutes and then end up taking a train that keeps getting delayed. It's late, and it's a weeknight, so I hail a cab. $7.83 12:30 a.m. — Skimp out on my usual skincare routine, read a few pages of my new book , which is amazing, and then I'm out.

At least twice a month I decide I'm going to become a person who works out in the morning, but so far I have a low success rate. 8:15 a.m. — Get out of class feeling great. It's always a gamble trying out a new instructor, but the playlist is on point today. I pick up the protein shake/smoothie I ordered before class from the smoothie bar at the studio. It's a chocolate peanut butter combination with blueberries, automatically charged to my debit card. It's a great perk of this studio, but it adds up. $7 8:55 a.m. — I swing by Starbucks and grab a grande iced coffee, unsweetened, with soy milk. I struggle with acne, so I've been trying to cut out dairy to see if it helps. $3.41 9:45 a.m. — I attempt to do the Thursday crossword puzzle, but I give up. I can make it through Monday and Tuesday no problem, but Wednesday and Thursday are iffy. Maybe one day. 11:30 a.m. — Struggling at work today. I recently switched from working in communications to working in research, which is closer to what I want to do, but it's a way less social environment, and I'm at my desk most of the time. 1:55 p.m. — I go to Chop't for lunch. I like Fresh&Co a lot better, but there isn't one by my office. I get a Mexican Caesar. $10.12 2 p.m. — Excel is either my best friend or worst nightmare. I decide to take a break from work and read a few articles on . 3 p.m. — Bumble date texts me saying he had a great time, and he'd like to see me this weekend. We make plans to go the Gutter (a bowling alley/bar in Brooklyn) on Saturday. 5 p.m. — Some coworkers invite me to get a drink with them after work. I feel like I've already drank a lot this week, but I want to socialize at my new job. 6:15 p.m. — We go to a divey bar and I legit gasp at how cheap drinks are. I get two beers, and I'm below the card minimum, so I buy one for my coworker. $11.04 8 p.m. — Home and craving something spicy, so I head to Xi'an Famous Foods and get the tingly beef noodles. I save half for lunch tomorrow. $11.24 Daily Total: $42.81",4,279
"6:30 a.m. — I head to spin class. It was ""Demi vs. Selena""–themed, so I couldn't miss it. The class unanimously agreed Demi “won.” I recently watched her YouTube documentary and loved it. Of course, I order a smoothie before class. $7 8:40 a.m. — It's Friday, which means bagel day. (I always get a bagel on Fridays.) I go to Leo's and order a bacon, egg, and cheese on an everything. $4.26 3 p.m. — I scan the local upcoming events and see that Roxane Gay is doing a speaking event soon, so I buy a ticket. I figure while I'm young and living in New York, I should take advantage of stuff like this, so I don't mind spending money on events. $25 7 p.m. — I'm getting my wisdom teeth out in a few days, so I head to the grocery store to stock up on soft food. I buy a few Naked shakes, Chobani, pudding, cottage cheese, two cartons of Halo Top (mint chip and chocolate), and applesauce. What a haul. $32.12 8:30 p.m. — Decide to have a quiet night in with my roommate and her boyfriend. I pick up a bottle of rosé at the store by my apartment. The prices are criminally expensive, but you pay for convenience. $17.12 10:45 p.m. — Finish the pint of chocolate Halo Top. I knew this would happen. 11:30 p.m. — I try a new serum I recently purchased from The Ordinary before bed. 11:55 p.m. — I watch the latest episode of and fall asleep.

We do an easy three miles around the reservoir and then catch up over coffee and croissants. I treat. $14.30 12:30 p.m. — My least favorite part of the week: laundry. I haul my clothes to the nearest laundromat, about a 10-minute walk away, and exchange a $10 bill for quarters. $10 12:45 p.m. — While I'm waiting for my clothes to dry, I grab tacos at a nearby food truck and take a walk around the neighborhood. $7.25 8 p.m. — Time for my date! I take the L train to Brooklyn and get there a bit early.

I buy a beer for each of us. $19.12 11 p.m. — We head back to his apartment to play Mario Kart. My motor vehicle driving skills are impaired from my alcohol consumption, and I lose both games.

I still have my ID from college, and it has definitely come in handy $12 3 p.m. — The museum is cool, but I'm underwhelmed. The MOMA remains my reigning favorite. 6 p.m. — I make myself pesto pasta and chicken for dinner. I would cook more, but my apartment is very small (no counter space) and it's a struggle with three people. I've been eyeing an Instant Pot, but haven't yet pulled the trigger. 8:30 p.m. — I clean my room and make sure I have everything ready for the week. Then I browse Amazon and order a few new books: by Samantha Irby, by Junot Díaz, and a Che Guevara biography (I'm a nerd, I know).

I've been working on a project that's fast approaching its deadline for a couple hours straight now, and I decide to take a break to eat some dates dipped in tahini. I also have a spoonful of edible cookie dough I made with my boyfriend last night, and then soft-boiled eggs with reheated congee and sautéed spinach. 1 p.m. — Barre subscription renewal. I have lower back and hip problems, so I try to do at-home barre workouts two to three times a week. It's cheaper than physical therapy and helps keep things stable. $30 6:30 p.m. — There's a spin studio near our apartment offering a two-for-one deal. I book bikes for my boyfriend and me and we walk to class together. $15 8 p.m. — Dinner is a smoothie with sweet potato, cauliflower, blueberries, heaps of cacao, and vegan protein.

"7 a.m. — Yogurt again for breakfast. I also cook oatmeal for lunch and add egg white, vegan protein, cacao and maca powder. I mix in dates and drizzle with tahini. Am I a food blogger yet? 9 a.m. — 30-minute Uber ride to the office. I try to make it in twice a week, mostly for the opportunity to socialize with people who are not my dog. I'm still learning Spanish though, so my conversations with coworkers are somewhat limited. $5.88 12:30 p.m. — Mmmm, protein oats at my desk. 2 p.m. — My mom's birthday is coming up, and since I won't be spending it with her this year, I send her flowers and chocolate to be delivered to her on the day of. $80 5 p.m. — Uber home. Traffic is terrible, so it takes almost an hour to make it back to my apartment. I check my air quality app and decide to take the dog out only for a quick walk, since it isn't great. $7.24 6:30 p.m. — Boxing class with a friend. Before I got sick, I was taking boxing classes pretty regularly. This is my first class back and it kicks my butt in the best way. We get tea afterward, and she picks up the bill. $15 8 p.m. — Pick up eggs and a bar of artisan soap on the walk home. For dinner, we make eggs with leftover sweet potato, avocado, and sautéed spinach. I'm rereading the series by Garth Nix, so I read while my boyfriend watches a couple episodes of . We set our alarms for the morning and pass out. $2 Daily Total: $110.12",2,280
"7:30 a.m. — Yogurt and coffee for breakfast. Boyfriend roasts all our coffee, and right now I'm loving the batch he roasted from Chiapas. Mexico grows some of the most phenomenal coffee. Boyfriend heads to work and I water our (many) plants before logging onto my computer. 10:30 a.m. — I need a break from work, so I take a walk around our neighborhood. Near our home, there's a beautiful tree-lined footpath loop that's about a mile long. It's perfect for people watching. On my way back, I buy sliced mango with chili and lime for $1.50 and eat it when I get back to the apartment. $1.50 12:30 p.m. — Another at-home barre workout. I choose a shorter workout today, since I'm sore from yesterday's boxing class. 2 p.m. — We have a beach trip coming up next month, and a few more people have decided to join. I book my flight ($100) and an extra hotel room to accommodate the newbies who pay me back on Venmo. $100 2:30 p.m. — Thinking about my trip has me thinking about my wardrobe, so I dig out my summer clothes to assess. Being sick caused me to lose weight, and while I know I'll eventually get back to my normal weight, none of my clothes fit right now. I see this as reason enough to buy an Isabel Marant skirt on The RealReal that is super on sale and a one-piece swimsuit from a local brand. $100 8 p.m. — Date night! Boyfriend and I have been together for six years and have lived together for almost that long. Having a designated date night carves out time specifically for our relationship, and it's something we both make a priority, even during the busiest of weeks. Tonight we try a new vegan restaurant nearby ($25, which we split) and make cinnamon rolls together (not a euphemism) when we get home. $12.50 Daily Total: $214",3,280
"7:30 a.m. — More yogurt, today with banana and mango. Boyfriend has to go in early today, and he makes me coffee before he leaves. True love. I settle in for a three-hour work call to go over quarterly earnings. 11:30 a.m. — I noticed a tiny hole forming along the seam of my favorite workout pants which, sadly, do not ship to Mexico, so I can't order a new pair. Once my call is over, I take them to a tailor nearby and he repairs it for about $1.60. While I'm waiting, I browse English books in a nearby bookstore and land on a biography of Coco Chanel and ($55). Books here are not cheap — the biography is especially expensive — but I spend enough to qualify for a sweet reusable bag. $56.60 1:30 p.m. — I make rice porridge with half an avocado and a hardboiled egg for lunch. My stomach is feeling a little queasy from last night's meal, so my lunch is light (and boring). I eat a couple of Saltines as well. 5 p.m. — I sign up for spinning and boxing classes tonight, since I know the spinning instructor is an easy one. I have one extra spin class credit, so I only have to pay for the boxing class. $15 9 p.m. — A friend is visiting for the week, and my boyfriend and I offer to meet him at the airport. Boyfriend pays for the Ubers both ways. We're all tired when we get back to our apartment, but we're excited to catch up, so we get drinks at a bar down the street. Our friend picks up the $62 tab. Daily Total: $71.60",4,280
"7 a.m. — Yogurt and coffee on our patio. On Friday mornings there's a small open-air market on our street, and I love listening to the sounds of the vendors setting up. It's mostly food and plant vendors, but there's a stall that sells vintage goods as well that's always worth checking out. 11 a.m. — The air quality is clear, thanks to rain last night. I take advantage and go for a lunch run in the Bosque de Chapultepec, a huge city park almost twice the size of Central Park. It's a huge tourist attraction, so the people-watching is always prime. 1 p.m. — I'm starving after my run, so I snack on dates dipped in tahini while I wait for a sweet potato to roast in the oven. I top the sweet potato with ghee, eggs, sautéed spinach, and avocado. 4 p.m. — Boyfriend gets home from work early on Fridays, and we usually make an effort to get to the market before it closes. While there, I pick up an etched mercury glass decanter ($3) from the vintage vendor and he buys a miniature cactus plant. We also share jicama slices with chili and lime ($0.75). Our visiting friend was out exploring all day, but he's back at the apartment when we return. We solidify plans for the night, and then I Skype with a friend from home while the other two nap. $3.75 8 p.m. — We have dinner and drinks at an amazing Oaxacan restaurant. We lived in Oaxaca a couple years ago and the mole at this restaurant is just as good as we remember it. We order way too much food and mezcal and split the $120 bill equally between the three of us. $40 Daily Total: $43.75",5,280
"6 a.m. — We head up to the mountains this morning for a soccer game. We're almost 10,000 feet above sea level and the air is so much cleaner than it is in the city. This also means the sun is a lot stronger, so I'm wearing sunscreen and reapplying throughout the day. It's early and I'm still sleepy when we arrive, so I buy cafe de olla to wake up. $1.25 12 p.m. — We get a ride back with friends and stop for tacos. $12 buys us 10 tacos to split and a couple beers. I pay, since I'm the only one with cash on hand. $12 8 p.m. — Lazy day! We come home and read/nap after the tacos. At around 8 p.m., my boyfriend and I make eggs with avocado, which we eat on the patio and with a couple glasses of wine. Then we read more and head to bed. Daily Total: $13.25",6,280
"9 a.m. — Sunday mornings in Mexico City are the absolute best — a number of streets shut down and become pedestrian/biker only, so my boyfriend and I decide to take the dog on a long walk to our favorite bakery. There are no signs, so I couldn't tell you the name of the place, but they have the best baguette and croissants in the city. We pick up a baguette and a couple pastries for later ($1.30, I pay) and share the baguette as we walk. We also stop for two coffees ($4.50, boyfriend treats). $1.30 11 a.m. — Sunday is market day. After our walk, we head to our usual market for weekly food supplies. I buy miso to make congee later this week, plus fruits, vegetables, and ingredients to make Josey Baker's Adventure Bread. I can't find psyllium husk, which the recipe calls for, but I figure I'll add extra chia seeds and hope it works (spoiler: it does). $35 3 p.m. — I spend the afternoon prepping for the week — in addition to baking the bread, I roast a couple sweet potatoes and make sauerkraut and coconut yogurt. Lunch ends up being a somewhat random medley of sautéed mushrooms, a hardboiled egg, half a sweet potato, and a spoonful of macadamia nut butter. 7 p.m. — Instagram scrolling during dinner — I know, I know, it's a terrible habit — leads me to purchase a swimsuit for our upcoming trip. I take a long walk to avoid any further boredom shopping. Boyfriend meets me at the park after playing in a soccer game and we walk back home together. $166 Daily Total: $202.30",7,280
"7 a.m. — I get to the office early today because I have a lot to get done before traveling out of town for work. I bring my own coffee and lunch today — I'm hoping I'll have time for a workout during my lunch break before heading out. I'm really bad about not eating breakfast (bad habit that I need to break), so I don't eat this morning. 11:30 a.m. — The morning is literally gone in the blink of an eye. I have an event to attend for a candidate announcing he's running for governor this year. I love election years; something about campaign season is so exciting to me. But because I almost forgot about this campaign event, I won't be able to go to the gym during my lunch break. 1 p.m. — After the campaign event, I run home to finish packing my bags and eat something before heading to my next event, where I'm teaching fifth graders about the Constitution and our founding fathers (though they could care less). On my way I stop at Sephora, because I've been scraping what's left of my Fenty foundation out of the bottle! I get a new bottle and somehow make it out of the store with just one thing. $57.24 6 p.m. — After a hectic day of running around, I finally get to my out of town work destination. I'm a state employee, so when I travel out of town I get to drive a state car and my hotel room is covered, which is really nice. I meet coworkers at a Thai restaurant for dinner and order crab rangoon for the table (my favorite), green tea, and spicy basil leaves. $22.08 Daily Total: $79.32",1,281
"6:45 a.m. — It's an early morning. Our board meeting starts at 8 a.m. but I like to get there early to get set up. I take advantage of the complimentary breakfast at the hotel and grab yogurt, granola, and coffee before heading out. 6 p.m. — The day has completely flown by! When I get back into town, I meet my boyfriend and all of our friends at Buffalo Wild Wings for dinner and beers for one of our friend's birthdays. $33 8:30 p.m. — After dinner, we take our friend to our favorite dive bar. (The bar is literally like everyone knows everyone, all of our parents drank here when they were our age, and the owner coached my boyfriend in basketball when he was little, ha!) When it's your birthday, the bartender and owner always buy the first two rounds, so we took our friend to get his birthday drinks. This bar also has the best jukebox, and I always spend way too much money on it. Tonight I only spend $10, though, which I'm proud of myself for! I have two drinks ($15.50). $25.50 Daily Total: $58.50",2,281
"9 a.m. — I have a late start to my day today, but because I worked so much overtime yesterday at the board meeting, it's okay that I come in a little later than usual. On my way to the office, I stop and get a soy latte and a bagel. I'm feeling slightly hungover from last night — I swear I can't even have three drinks anymore without being hungover. $8.78 1 p.m. — On Fridays I get off early because I work overtime during the week. I usually leave around noon, but today I stay until 1 because I'm feeling a little guilty for coming in later (even though I worked so much yesterday *eye roll*). On my way home, I text my boyfriend (who took the day off because he wasn't ""feeling well"") and ask if he wants me to grab us lunch on my way home. I stop and get tacos for him and a bean and cheese burrito for me. Tacos and burritos are the cure-all to hangovers! $7.76 for my half. $7.76 5 p.m. — After a solid nap, I wake up feeling like a new person and apparently decide it's a good idea to spend $25.95 on a bandana from Barstool for our dog that says ""Saturdays Are For The Good Boys."" So there's that. We head over to my boyfriend's dad's house for dinner with his dad, brother, and nephew. $25.95 Daily Total: $42.49",3,281
"8:30 a.m. — I just have to say, it's so nice to wake up without an alarm. I meet one of my friends for yoga at our gym and then we go to brunch, get bottomless mimosas (obvi), and share a flight of avocado toast and a scrambler. SO GOOD! $27.35 12:30 p.m. — After brunch, we head to Target because I need to get new sheets and a comforter for our bed. Our dog ripped a little hole in our sheets, and then my BF put his foot through said hole getting into bed the other night — so now the hole is huge. We bought a king-sized bed last year and still use a queen comforter, so for new bedding. In my typical fashion, I can't leave Target without getting at least one other thing that I don't need, and end up getting new tea towels that say ""Everyday I'm Brusselin"" with brussels sprouts on them. $58.88 3 p.m. — After Target, I drop my friend off at her car and head to the grocery store to get stuff for dinner. We're having some of our couple friends over for dinner to watch the NCAA tournament (Go Duke!). I'm making the jalapeño tuna casserole from Chrissy Teigen's cookbook, . The total comes to $10.80 for my half (after splitting with my boyfriend). $10.80 Daily Total: $97.03",4,281
"8 a.m. — I wake up before my boyfriend, make myself coffee, and start breakfast for us. We already have everything I need, so I don't have to go to the store, which is always nice. I make us strawberry pancakes and bacon with fresh fruit, and then eat without him because I'm not letting these pancakes get cold! 12:30 p.m. — I head to the grocery store to get stuff for dinner and for game snacks. One of our friends is coming over for more NCAA tournament, and I'm making buffalo chicken dip, guacamole, salad, and potatoes for dinner. It's my boyfriend's turn to cook dinner, and he's grilling steaks and potatoes. $20.82 9 p.m. — I try to dedicate Sundays to self-care to get ready for the week ahead. Sometimes that means eating my body weight in buffalo chicken dip and dark chocolate, and other times it means an expensive face mask and bubble bath. Today is a mixture of both. I'm in bed by 9 p.m. with a clean house and a full belly, reading my book ( AMAZING, btw) until I fell asleep. Daily Total: $20.82",5,281
"8 a.m. — I'm trying really hard to tell myself to ""think positive thoughts, live a positive life"" — but Mondays suck. I make my coffee at home and pack whatever I can find for lunch because I'll make lunches for the week tonight after work. 1 p.m. — I usually pack lunch and eat in my office because I like to use my lunch hour to go to the gym. It's less crowded then, and the classes I like are usually during my lunch hour. Today I go to Body Pump, which kills me. When I get back to the office, I drink the soy protein drink I brought and eat a granola bar and veggie chips. My gym shoes are starting to wear out on the bottom, which is making the traction super slippery, so I order a new pair of Nikes. $54.97 5:30 p.m. — When I get home from work, I wait for my BF to finish working out and then we head to the grocery store together to get stuff for dinner. We're making a turkey white bean chili tonight in the Instant Pot. We pretty much have everything we need except for beans, green chilis, and onion. $2.36 7 p.m. — After we eat dinner, I make lunch for the week with stuff I already have at home. I try not to eat a lot of meat, so I make brown rice pasta with pesto and cherry tomatoes. I also download an app called You Need a Budget, which my brother-in-law and sister-in-law swear by. The first 34 days are free and after that it's $83 annually, which is about $7 a month. I'd like to get my yoga teaching certificate this fall, and it's super expensive to do that (about $3,000), so I'm trying to be more mindful and save up! Daily Total: $57.33",6,281
"7 a.m. — Back to the grind of my flex schedule, which means getting to work at 7 a.m. I surprisingly don't have too hard of a time waking up this morning! I grab my gym bag, pesto pasta bowl, and granola bar, and head out the door. When I get to the office this early, I'm usually the only one here, which I really enjoy because I can get a lot accomplished. I make coffee and get going on my to-do list. 12 p.m. — The workout class I want to go today isn't until 5 p.m., so I eat my lunch in my office and read articles during my lunch hour. I'm getting paid this Friday (thank goodness!), so I'm trying not to spend any money between now and then. But today our cable and internet bill automatically comes out of my account so there goes $176. Oh, and our poop guy payment (yes, we have a guy that comes and picks up the dog poop out of our backyard) was charged to our card today for the month. 6 p.m. — After my workout class, I head home and eat leftovers for dinner. We didn't plan on making anything for dinner tonight because we knew we'd be getting home a little later than usual. I enjoy alone time cleaning up the house, getting my gym bag ready for tomorrow, and reading before my BF gets home and we watch TV and get ready for bed. Daily Total: $0",7,281
"7:30 a.m. — Up and ready for the day! I normally leave the house around 8:30, but I'm trying to get up a little earlier so that I can move at a slower pace and enjoy my mornings more. I throw on a kettle of hot water, pour myself a cup of green tea, and read through the morning news before getting dressed. 8:30 a.m. — Head out the door and walk down to the train station. My commute is made up of 30 minutes of walking to and from stations and 25 minutes on BART. I prefer it this way, though, because my job has me sitting for most of the day, and this is a consistent way for me to get in physical activity. 9:30 a.m. — Get into the office and grab a coconut chocolate Rxbar from the kitchen. Of all of the protein bars I've tried, these are by far the least offensive, though their texture can make them a little hard to chew. Still, it's a great way to get a good protein boost in the morning — I recommend the coconut chocolate or peanut butter flavor. I settle at my desk to start my work where I left off yesterday. 12 p.m. — My job has a lot of perks, but one of my favorites is that we have lunch and dinner catered every day! I head over to the café with my team and load up on stir-fried veggies and tofu, baby spinach salad, and garlic roasted potatoes. My sweet tooth usually gets the best of me after lunch, but today I'm too stuffed for dessert. 1 p.m. — Evidently I'm not too full for something else! My stomach leads me back to the kitchen, where I grab a cherry pie Larabar to snack on at my desk. 5 p.m. — Whew, finished! Spent most of the day poring over one specific bug in our codebase, and I'm so relieved that I figured out the underlying cause and got it resolved. I reward myself with a cup of freshly brewed chai and take a few minutes to relax before heading home. 6 p.m. — Back home for 30 minutes to grab a bite to eat before leaving again to hit the gym. All of the treadmills are taken, so I kill time on the elliptical while keeping an eye out for a free machine. Finally one clears up! I'm especially enthusiastic as I crank out three miles before hopping off and heading home. I chug a big bottle of water, shower, and watch on Netflix. The Christina Tosi episode leaves me with a newfound desire to become a pastry chef. 10 p.m. — Lie down in bed and meditate for 10 minutes with the 10% Happier app. I know it's a horrible habit to be on my phone right before bed, but I just can't seem to quit it and spend 30 more minutes browsing Reddit before falling asleep. Daily Total: $0",1,282
"7:05 a.m. — My alarm goes off and my arm shoots out to turn it off before it wakes up my roommate. I lie in bed for a few more minutes, totally content, before springing up to get my day started. Settle in downstairs with my usual cup of tea and the news. 9:30 a.m. — Today is bagel day at our office! Technically we always have bags of bagels on hand in the kitchen, but on Wednesdays we get a fresh order from the place next door. I help myself to a toasted plain bagel with a smoked salmon schmear. 12 p.m. — Lunch today is peppered ahi tuna with rice and sautéed kale. Usually I grab lunch with my team, but I always take at least one day a week to eat alone for quality “me time.” I poke around the kitchen for dessert and come away with a few peanut butter cups to munch on at my desk. 2 p.m. — I get an email notification from Zara that a dress I want is finally back in stock! I mull over whether to buy it, since the dress is pricey, but ultimately decide to go for it because a) it's extremely cute, and b) if it goes out of stock again, it might not come back. $75.84 4:45 p.m. — Wrap up a few last things at work before grabbing my stuff to head to BART. Our company doesn't have set work hours (I don't think most tech companies do), but I prefer to work on a pretty consistent schedule so that my day feels structured. 6 p.m. — Back home before I run out to the gym again. I clock in my standard three miles while bopping to Kendrick Lamar. The man won a Pulitzer! What can't he do? Hop in the shower once I get home and catch up on the YouTube channels I subscribe to while munching on Girl Scout cookies and a kale salad. (Life is about balance, right?) 9:30 p.m. — My run totally wiped me out today. I lie on my bed with the intention of just resting for a minute, but immediately fall asleep. Daily Total: $75.84",2,282
"7:05 a.m. — I'm feeling hungrier than usual, so I spread apple butter on toast to eat with my morning tea. I grew up on the east coast, where my mom consistently brought me to Amish farmer's markets to get apple butter (amongst other things), so now I always keep a jar of it on hand. 10 a.m. — Get into work a little later than usual today, because my first meeting isn't until 10 a.m. I swing by the kitchen to grab a coconut chocolate Rxbar before heading off to the meeting room. 12 p.m. — Grabbing lunch today with other ladies on the team. Today I get roasted mushrooms and carrots, brown rice pilaf, and Israeli couscous salad. I really appreciate that our office has such healthy and delicious options! Get back to my desk and spend 10 minutes reading Money Diaries before getting back to work. 2:30 p.m. — I'm in desperate need of new razors and there's a Walgreens next to my office, so I pop out for 10 minutes to pick some up. Use my store card and a coupon to save $4 on my purchase. $4.50 6 p.m. — I run three more miles at the gym, followed by a class at Berkeley! I used to go to school here and am lucky that I live close enough to the university to occasionally drop in on classes that look interesting. Today, I attend a human rights lecture with my friend who will be graduating later this semester. We learn about how prevalent child sex trafficking is across the world, even right here in the Bay Area. The conversation is thought-provoking, and leaves me with a lot on my mind. 9 p.m. — Friend from lecture comes over to chat and we hang out for a bit while eating donuts she made. Bid each other goodbye around 10, since I have work tomorrow. Daily Total: $4.50",3,282
"7:05 a.m. — Wake up to a Mint notification that my paycheck has been deposited! I've already contributed to my investment accounts this month, so I take a chunk of my paycheck and make my monthly contribution to my house down payment savings account. I definitely want to buy a house some day and I know it's going to be exorbitantly expensive, so I'm working hard to prepare for it now! 9:30 a.m. — I feel like I've been eating too much sugar lately, so I switch things up and grab a plain cup of Greek yogurt for breakfast. Definitely not the most pleasant to eat without toppings, but I remind myself of the health benefits and get through it. 12 p.m. — Lunch with the team again today. The only other female engineer is out this week, so it's just me and the guys. It can be intimidating at times to be one of the only women (and the youngest engineer!), but I remind myself that I worked my ass off to get here and am just as competent as everyone else. 4:30 p.m. — I have one more thing left to do but can't muster the brain power to logic through this bug, so I tell myself I'll figure it out next week and grab my stuff to leave. Pop on a podcast and walk to BART. 7 p.m. — I have time for a longer workout since it's Friday, so I head to the gym and run five miles at a slower pace. I definitely think exercising consistently has had an effect on me, because I'm able to get through the run semi-comfortably and my legs don't feel like goo afterwards. 8 p.m. — Race back home to shower before going to a dance showcase my friend is in! There are lots of hip hop dance troupes at Berkeley, and this is her first time doing anything like this, so I definitely want to go and support her. I cheer embarrassingly loud from the crowd as she gets on stage for her set. 10 p.m. — The showcase was amazing, but I'm exhausted and turn down my friends for drinks afterwards. Head home, change into my pajamas, and drink a cup of hot water with lemon before calling it quits and going to bed. Daily Total: $0",4,282
"9 a.m. — I sleep in and then head downstairs to make a fried egg on sourdough toast and a cup of chamomile tea. 11 a.m. — Today is Berkeley's welcome celebration for admitted students, and the whole campus comes out for events and festivities throughout the day. My friends and I walk through all of the booths and stalls — it's really weird watching all of the incoming freshmen experience campus for the first time, and it makes us all nostalgic for our first years. We stop by a small Korean restaurant for lunch. I get a bowl with brown rice, tofu, greens, and teriyaki sauce — yum! $7.59 3 p.m. — Back home after more campus exploration. I'm really sleepy for some reason and crawl into my bed to take a nap, but at the last minute feel bad about wasting time and potentially throwing off my sleep schedule. Get back up and head downstairs where I make tea and crack open a book. 5 p.m. — Gym time! I run another five miles at a slightly faster pace than yesterday, and my body feels weirdly amazing during and after. Is this what a runner's high is? 7 p.m. — I shower after I get back from the gym and tidy up the apartment a little bit. I don't normally get the chance to help out with chores during the week, so I try to do as much as possible to help my roommate out on weekends. 9 p.m. — Roommate comes back from her waitressing job and we get into a lengthy discussion about pie and cake. Both of us are absolutely obsessed with food, and we're always bouncing new recipe ideas off of one another. Daily Total: $7.59",5,282
"8:45 a.m. — I meant to get up a little earlier to get ready before yoga, but I slept through my alarm. I jump straight out of bed, change into leggings and a tank top, and run out to my class. Make it to the session just as they're about to start, and thankfully they have snacks and water! Grab a Larabar before settling onto a mat and moving into child's pose. 10:15 a.m. — Yoga was great! I don't go regularly because I usually run, but today's class has made me reconsider my stance. I feel so relaxed, loose, and comfortable in my own body. After yoga, I go to the Target downtown to pick up almond milk, plus a sandwich at the shop next door to eat later for lunch. $10.87 12 p.m. — Once I finish up lunch at home, I decide to take on a task I've been avoiding for the last week or so: laundry. I grab my bag of dirty clothes from upstairs and schlep it down to the basement where the machines in our buildings are. I know I'm an adult, but it still scares the crap out of me to be down here alone. Throw my clothes in and swipe my card to pay before sprinting back up the stairs to safety. $4 4 p.m. — Today really is a lazy Sunday. I fold my laundry and put it away, and then spend the rest of the afternoon whipping up a batch of fresh cinnamon rolls out of pure boredom. 7 p.m. — Watch a few episodes of on Netflix before calling it a night and going to sleep. Daily Total: $14.87",6,282
"7:05 a.m. — Standard cup of tea and the news this morning — sometimes I feel like I sound like an old lady with these habits. 10 a.m. — Get to my desk and start work when I get an email that a wallet I wanted is on sale (these sale email notifications will be the death of my bank account, I swear). Mull over color options for a few minutes before purchasing one I like. $6.50 12 p.m. — Lunch with the team again. We get into a discussion about the pros and cons of attending Burning Man and the different things people have built/set up over the years there. Some of my teammates have actually gone before (and I've never been), so I'm fascinated by the things they've done there. 5 p.m. — Chug through a couple more bugs and a meeting at work before packing up my stuff to head home. My guilty pleasure is listening to Dave Ramsey's podcast on the walk to the train station, but it can get repetitive after a while. 6 p.m. — Today is my rest day, so I don't go for a run and instead make a kale salad for dinner while watching another episode of on Netflix. Polish off the meal with one of the cinnamon rolls I made yesterday. Daily Total: $6.50",7,282
"6:45 a.m. — I'm awake. I tidy up the living room and kitchen and turn the dishwasher on, then jump in the shower, draw my face on (moisturizer, concealer, eye shadow, eyebrows, and mascara), get dressed, take my probiotic (I've had a few yeast infections in the last year, TMI, sorry), put my breakfast and lunch in my purse, kiss A. goodbye, and catch the train. 9 a.m. — In the office. Get my coffee together and settle down for work and breakfast. 10:30 a.m. — I've been feeling nauseous and headache-y for two days. I think my building is having water pipe issues, because the shower drain reeks and so does the staircase. I do quick research and see that it may be a water pipe issue, which may be the reason for my nausea and headache. GROSS. Make a mental note to call my landlord. 11:50 a.m. — Come up for air. Hubby has an interview in the city and wants to meet for lunch. Yasss (even though I brought lunch). We sit outside at a local café because the weather is absolutely stunning — I order a Caesar salad and hubby gets a sandwich. $26.42 4:35 p.m. — Take another break to tidy up the office kitchen and order a few things off Amazon: face sheet masks, Bio-Oil, multi-purpose cleaning wipes, face cream, and shelves for my shoes. $134.35 5:45 p.m. — It feels weird to be the first to leave the office, but ya girl crossed everything off her to-do list and tonight is our date-aversary (yes, it's the little things). I asked my man to pick a restaurant (because I always choose, and it's always sushi), but alas he lets me choose again, so we're having sushi. 9 p.m. — We eat our way to food comas, and I am so damn happy. After dinner, we walk laps around the block before calling it a night at midnight. $71.08 Daily Total: $231.85",1,283
"10 a.m. — And we're up! Today is a public holiday, so A. and I sleep in and snuggle. We eat yogurt for breakfast, and then get started cleaning. We usually clean on weekends, but we choose to clean this morning because we want to relax this weekend. A. handles the kitchen, living room, vacuuming, and garbage, while I handle the bedroom and bathroom and then dust and steam mop. I am so thankful that my husband likes a clean apartment as much as I do. I also throw in a load of laundry. Okay, honesty hour: I love doing laundry. My most adult moment to date was when I purchased our washer and dryer…best feeling ever. I love them. 12 p.m. — The apartment is spotless, so I whip up brunch — eggs over easy for hubs and a bowl of cereal for me. We then head over to my in-laws' house to catch up with them, and my mother-in-law makes us a real meal. I make a mental note to send my own mother a gift for Mother's Day. The woman deserves an island, and I can only afford, like, a candle. 4:30 p.m. — Some cousins are coming over to check out our new apartment, so hubs and I head home and my mother-in-law sends us off with cake. I always like to have homemade desserts in the fridge, but I've been really lazy last week. Mother-in-law is so clutch. 7 p.m. — Guests leave. It's so draining making small talk with the wives, who are much older than I am. On the plus side, my cousin and her hubs brought their eight-month-old, who is just the cutest munchkin ever. And they brought over a set of gorgeous plates for us — a gift from my aunt. 10:30 p.m. — A. and I tidy up and run the dishwasher. I call my parents, who live in the States, and then we watch (so, so, so good!) until midnight. Daily Total: $0",2,283
"7:30 a.m. — Major regrets over watching TV so late — I'm so exhausted. Hubby kicks me out of the bed instead of snuggling, and I am low-key annoyed. I want nothing more than to run under a hot shower, but there is just no time. I remember that my boss is not in today and my other two bosses usually stroll in the office at 10 a.m., so it's okay if I'm just a little late. I do my usual morning routine of moisturizing, makeup, and getting breakfast and lunch together. I hate leaving A. with no food, but homeboy is just going to have to figure it out. 8:19 a.m. — I miss my train and the next one doesn't come for 30 minutes (something I am not used to as a New Yorker), so I have to take the bus, which I hate. I get nauseous and it takes forever. 9:10 a.m. — I'm in the office. It's been quiet lately and almost everyone is out, so I use the time to send thank you messages and order a gift certificate to the spa for my mommy. I also use the time to look at dresses for my brother's wedding in the fall, along with plane tickets for the summer (we're planning a vacation to Greece and Croatia) and plane tickets to NY for the wedding. $119.24 12:30 p.m. — My coworker asks if I want to grab lunch, but I brought food from home. I also just don't feel like making awkward small talk, so we “plan” for another day. I step out of the office to buy sweet potatoes and cinnamon strudel. I avoid cooking on Fridays (my day off), but we have food at home, so I plan to quickly roast sweet potatoes and regular potatoes for dinner. $6 6:30 p.m. — I'm home and A. is at the gym. I put the potatoes in the oven for dinner. I would love nothing more than to go out to dinner tonight, but I'm #BallinOnABudget. I finish up watching and I tell A. what he missed when he comes home. Now he wants to watch, so I watch the last two episodes again. 10:45 p.m. — I put on a face mask, tidy up the living room, and call it a night. Daily Total: $125.24",3,283
"9:30 a.m. — Thank the good L-rd for the weekend. A. has been feeling down in the dumps lately due to being unemployed and some family issues, so he heads out to the gym with friends. I enjoy my alone time. (I can be very introverted.) I jump in the shower, shave, put on makeup, get laundry going, and start to iron clothing. I text my brother to buy a card for our mom for Mother's Day and ask him to insert the gift certificate in the card. It's 3:30 a.m. on that side of the world, but he'll see it when he wakes up. 11:15 a.m. — I notice we're almost out of groceries and Ramadan is approaching, so A. and I run out to Aldi to get some essentials, since we're both going to fast. We're trying to figure out the meat situation in our house. We're deciding between buying in bulk at Aldi (which we don't want to do because the quality is subpar, but it costs much less) or buying fresh every day (which we want to do, but it's pricier). Anyway, we buy a loaf of bread, wraps, eggs, broccoli, yogurt, various cheeses, juice, lemons, deli slices, potatoes, milch mause chocolates (so yum), cottage cheese, mayo, lemon juice, apple sauce, blueberries, razors, shaving cream, salt, vinegar, nuts, and chicken cutlets (though I don't get too many, because with Ramadan coming up we want to stick to halal meat). $117.01 1 p.m. — We then go to our local supermarket and buy two packs of water and ground beef for moussaka tonight. $8.86 1:30 p.m. — My husband brings the groceries up and I put them away. Then I get started on making dinner, because we're hangry. 2:15 p.m. — A. would like to help with dinner, so I ask him to cut the potatoes on the mandoline slicer and tell him 505 times to watch his fingers — and what does he do?! Almost slices his damn finger off. I'm a fainter when I see blood, but there is just no time for that. I clean up his wound with hydrogen peroxide and he's in one piece. I continue with the food and turn on the TV to A. goes down for a nap. 4 p.m. — Dinner is ready. When we're done, a friend of ours calls to meet up — his girlfriend, who lives in Switzerland, is in town, and she's so lovely. We get ready, and then they pick us up in said girlfriend's convertible. So amazing. We drive around, go to a carnival, and then get drinks at a café. They graciously pay. I make a mental note to always keep hair ties in the car if A. and I ever have a convertible. 10:30 p.m. — We're finally home, and we're exhausted. We put on face masks, and then I watch on Netflix while making a cake. I talk to my parents on the phone and head to bed around midnight. Daily Total: $125.87",4,283
"6 a.m. — A. has a hard time staying asleep, so I get woken up with kisses and he asks me what time I want to wake up...no, not right now. 9:30 a.m. — I get a text from my mother-in-law saying that the fam would like to swing by today. We have friends coming around 1 p.m., so I peel myself from bed, get in the shower, and then tidy up. I text my mother-in-law around 11 and tell her to swing by whenever. 12:45 p.m. — My husband and I get into an argument, so I'm a bit angry, annoyed, and teary, but I gotta get myself together because we have guests coming soon. I put all my emotions into ironing until our guests arrive, and then I just suck it up and put on a front. 4:30 p.m. — Our guests leave. It was nice to have positive energy in the apartment to lighten the atmosphere. My husband and I make up with a kiss, but TBH I'm still annoyed. 6 p.m. — The in-laws arrive and we hang out for a while until they leave around 8 p.m. 9 p.m. — I finally find the strength to tidy up the living room and get the dishwasher going after laying around watching I'm sad to have finished , because now I have nothing to watch on Netflix. A. and I put on clay masks and then retire to bed. Daily Total: $0",5,283
"4 a.m. — Hubby wakes me up again with kisses, and this time I am sleep talking (I sleep talk quite often). It's complete nonsense, as always, but A. goes along with it. It's hysterical and alarming at the same time. 7:35 a.m. — Crap. I oversleep. I jump out of bed and get ready for work. My husband has a few interviews lined up this week, one being today, and I'm so excited for him. I write him a good luck love note on a Post-it, kiss my man, and jet out the door. I take a quick look in the mirror on my way out and analyze my skin — I've always had clear skin, but felt that my skin tone was uneven and just, blah. With the clay mask, face mask, and Bio-Oil, I've seen MAJOR improvement. It looks so alive. Money well spent. 8:55 a.m. — Before I get in, I buy milk at the nearest grocery store for the office. My company reimburses me. ($2.98 expensed) 1 p.m. — I eat my lunch and then go outside for air. My immediate colleague is the big boss's girlfriend, and she is so draining. I should try be on her good side, because she's the girlfriend of the big boss, right? Wrong. She's the admin assistant, so I delegate some tasks to her. But she thinks she has some authority over me for some reason? I don't know what world she lives in and how she made it to 2018. I can't complain, because I need my job at this moment. I'm just going to have to suck it up for now. 5:20 p.m. — Take a quick break to look at prayer mats for A. and new hijabs on Etsy. I put a few things in my cart for later. 7:15 p.m. — I'm home just in time before a monsoon starts outside. I call my mom and put together this slammin' stew for the start of Ramadan, which A. tells me is not tomorrow after all, but I don't think he's right… 9:20 p.m. — Catch up on and tidy up. I take two birth control pills because I missed a day — oops. Daily Total: $0",6,283
"3:16 a.m.— My alarm wakes me to get suhoor together, but A. tells me Ramadan doesn't start today, so I go back to sleep. We will never know. 6:45 a.m. — Alarm wakes me up again and I'm not about it. Hubby and I cuddle and kiss. 7:14 a.m. — I would give everything under the sun to stay in bed, but I need to get up. I throw myself in the shower, put makeup on, get dressed, and get breakfast and lunch together. 8:50 a.m. — I'm on the bus and I want to vomit because there are too many people and it's hot. I get out at the next stop and walk 10 minutes to the office. 9:03 a.m. — Finally get to work. I really needed the fresh air. I'm amongst the first in. I go into the kitchen to turn the dishwasher on, as the cleaning lady didn't come this morning, and tidy up around the coffee machine. Big boss's girlfriend and another coworker stroll in, and we chat by the coffee machine. 6:45 p.m. — Home. Today is swim day! In an effort to stay active, A. and I try to go to our local pool once a week. The big pool is so cold it should be against the law, so I avoid that one and go into the smaller, warmer one. We have one free entry bracelet and pay for another. $2.98 9 p.m. — We're home and exhausted. We call it an early night because we have to be up at 3 a.m. for the start of Ramadan. We get into bed and I peruse a deep dark site called Etsy. I want it ALL. I buy a marble bathroom accessory set (obsessed with all things calacatta marble) that is So. Damn. Cute. I hold off on the prayer mats until I find something I like. $104.90 Daily Total: $107.88",7,283
"6.40 a.m. — Baby wakes up, so I grab her to change her nappy and head to the kitchen to start making coffee. I make myself toast with peanut butter, mashed banana, and honey. Trying to get out the door to work can be hard sometimes when I just want to play with the baby all day! 9 a.m. — Arrive at work and prep for a meeting. I make a cup of tea. (My office provides free coffee and tea.) 10:30 a.m. — Meeting is about to start, and my colleague brings in freshly made scones and jam! I scarf one down. 11:30 a.m. — Meeting is done, and I heat up leftover minestrone soup for an early lunch because I'm going to a forum during my lunch hour. 4 p.m. — Forum was great — it was about racism and sexual health in Australia. I grab a pastry on the way out and pay for parking on my parking app, which is so much more convenient than carrying heaps of coins with me! $4.23 8 p.m. — I get home early, so I get to hang out with the baby, which is extra special. We have a yummy dinner of spelt pasta with eggplant, spinach, red sauce, and smoked mozzarella with  wine, and watch and until my sister arrives. (She's staying with us for the weekend, yay!). Daily Total: $4.23",1,284
"7 a.m. — Wake up and peruse Instagram while laying in my bed. I finally get up and head to the kitchen to start coffee and grab a bowl of wheat squares with almond milk. Make wifey a bowl of the same thing but with Moo Milk, and I am out the door! 11:15 a.m. — We work near a really beautiful lake and park, so a few colleagues and I try to go for walks around the lake most days. Because we have a health policy, this walking time is incorporated into our days and doesn't take time away from our designated lunch hour. After the walk, we all sit outside in the work garden, and I eat vegan leftovers that I had from a workshop we had the other day. 3 p.m. — I remember we still have leftover cake, so I grab myself a slice. Then I make a phone call to an amazing woman who talks me through how to make the survey that I'm working on more gender diverse and trans inclusive. I hang up, and consider maybe I'm in the wrong job. 5 p.m. — Off to home I go! Wifey asked me to stop by someone's house and pick up free onesies, so I head there first. Traffic is terrible, though, and I regret going on a Friday night at peak hour. I'm almost out of gas, so I stop at the gas station in the hopes that maybe traffic won't be so bad in a few minutes. $57.52 6:30 p.m. — I finally make it to dinner at this new Indian place around the corner from our house with my wife, the baby, my sister, my cousin, and two of our friends. We enjoy happy hour Aperol Spritzes and delicious food! Wifey and I pay for our share of the dinner. $52.88 8:30 p.m. — Everyone comes back to our house so we can put the baby to sleep. We continue drinking more wine and tea with dessert. Daily Total: $110.40",2,284
"7:30 p.m. — Wifey and I wake up with colds. I make coffee and porridge with almond milk, cherries, cashews, cinnamon, Greek yogurt, and maple syrup for myself, my wife, and my sister. 11:15 a.m. — We all decide to head to the farmer's market one suburb away. Wifey is starving, so we swing by Falafel House and get her a falafel wrap ($5.50). By the time we get to the market, there isn't much produce left, but we get a bag of mushrooms ($4.50) and beautiful purple dahlias ($6). My sister and I have delicious Korean/Japanese food from a food truck that I go to regularly. I get the chicken teriyaki ($8.30) and my sister gets the chicken koreano. $24.30 4.15 p.m. — We have a lazy afternoon but decide to head to the park for a bit. Baby loves the park because she loves looking at all the big kids and going on the swings. We walk to the store and grab chocolate, salami, milk, carrots, a can of tomatoes, and red lentils. $14 5:30 p.m. — My sister heads off to her hotel because she has to get up at 3 a.m. for a work event tomorrow. Wifey and I debate ordering pizza because she has a $10 off coupon, but then she decides to cook dinner, and makes us carrot, pumpkin, and red lentil soup with toasted cheese sandwiches — just the thing for this autumn evening! Daily Total: $38.30",3,284
"10:45 a.m. — We've been up for awhile just chilling at home. My mate, A., texts me and asks to hang out. I suggest this place for brunch that's like an urban farm with a café, and I bring the baby. I get a long black and a Korean fried chicken burger with potatoes. We both share our food with the baby, as she is eating solid food these days. $31.73 1 p.m. — After dropping off the baby, I catch the tram to meet a friend and see at the movies. This is a birthday treat for him, so I pay for the tickets. $43.14 5:30 p.m. — Movie was lovely and gave me all the feels! And it was great to see my mate. I stop by a pharmacy on my home to pick up a humidifier, because the three of us are all stuffy and I'm hoping this will make us feel better! $32.50 6:30 p.m. — Home in time to switch parents! Wifey is heading to a comedy show, so it's just me and the baby tonight. I heat up pasta leftovers because the baby loves pasta. Then I give her a bath, and she gets water everywhere! 10 p.m. — Wifey is finally home! Baby has just transitioned to an arms out swaddle, and man that was hard work! I had trouble putting her down — every time I coughed, she woke up. By the time Wifey got home, the baby and I were both crying. But now finally — sleep! Daily Total: $107.37",4,284
"8:30 a.m. — It's Monday morning, but because I'm facilitating a workshop that doesn't finish until later tonight, I don't have to be in the office until 12 p.m. — yay! I enjoy breakfast of fried eggs on toast with Wifey and the baby, and then I get to work on applying for this leadership program I want to do. The application due date is today! 12 p.m. — Get to work and catch up on the office gossip. The CEO has been on leave and a manager left recently, so I want to know how that went down. I decide to eat lunch now, because who doesn't want to start the day with lunch! I heat up leftover soup. 3 p.m. — I'm rushing to finish a draft for this workshop that I am facilitating for Culturally and Linguistically Diverse (CALD) women on gender equality. I ran it a few weeks ago, and I think a lot of things need to be changed for me to be happy with it. I grab a cup of tea and a biscuit from the kitchen so I can power on. 6 p.m. — Workshop starts, and I meet the women for the first time this week. They are lovely, and one of them brings her five-month-old baby, so I get to have a cuddle as well. I eat the very minimal dinner provided: grapes, watermelon, crackers, and French onion dip. But hey, at least it's free?! Daily Total: $0",5,284
"8:30 a.m. — I'm heading to a work event, so I quickly eat cereal and put my coffee in a to-go cup. I'm not the most confident driver or parker if I don't know where I'm going, and I want to allow plenty of time to get there. 10:45 a.m. — The event is a launch for a new sexual and reproductive health strategy for a women's health organization. I grab two mini bagels with smoked salmon and a savory muffin to take with me for the hour-long journey back to work. 11:45 a.m. — I get back to the office and need to put my head down and work to make sure I am fully prepared for my meeting this afternoon. My lovely colleague offered to run to the shops and grab me sushi. I pay her back. $3 6 p.m. — I get home late because traffic is really bad! I eat delicious mushroom stroganoff for dinner with a glass of wine and then I'm ready for bed! Daily Total: $3",6,284
"7.30 a.m. — I get up at my usual time, but am feeling fairly unwell. This cold has really got me down. For breakfast I eat toast with eggs and coffee. 11 a.m. — Wifey and the baby have gone to meet friends for lunch, so I just chill at home. I decide to run to the store to get sweet treats. I pick up a chocolate chip brioche, Nutella, and caramel spread. I head back home intending to work on my résumé, but I decide to binge watch instead because I am seriously behind. $11.51 2:30 p.m. — I feel very sick, and nap the rest of the afternoon. 5 p.m. — Wifey wants me to come with her and the baby to pick up a free little car for the baby. I go with them, but don't feel well at all. We stop by the pharmacy on the way home, and I grab cough syrup and a nail buffer I have been meaning to buy for ages. We get home, and I pass out in bed. $14.02 Daily Total: $25.53",7,284
"6:30 a.m. — My alarm goes off and I lay in bed checking my phone. I peek through the bedroom curtains and see three deer in my backyard. I love this kind of stuff! Then I make my way to the kitchen to feed the cats, make coffee in my French press (since getting this and a Yeti, my Starbucks visits have DRAMATICALLY decreased) and scramble eggs for today's and tomorrow's breakfasts. I'm in the shower by 6:55, where I make the executive decision to skip washing my hair. By 7:55, I'm dressed and running from one end of the house to the other, collecting things I'll need for the day and kissing my husband and cats goodbye. When I reach the back door, I grab the work-food bag I prepped last night (English muffins, butter, apples, and individual creamy peanut butter cups) and shove in the two containers of eggs I made this morning, along with a change of shoes, a comb, and hairspray. We're out the door by 8 a.m. 8:10 a.m. — Arrive at work 10 minutes late, which, unfortunately, is normal for me. I'm constantly trying to do as many things as I can in the morning, when in reality I just don't get up early enough. My boss is on spring break with his family this week, and my partner/work wife called in to say she's staying home with her son, who sounds like he has the flu. The stock market looks like it's gonna be a disaster today, and there's a possibility that we'll (i.e. I'LL) have to do a lot of selling in client accounts. My partner Facetimes me and we review our market strategies. We let out a giant sigh of relief when we realize it's not as bad as it looks, and agree to monitor the situation as we end our call. In the break room, I throw a cinnamon-raisin English muffin into the toaster oven and microwave fully-cooked bacon and the scrambled the eggs I made this morning. I take my breakfast back to my desk and continue working. 11:45 a.m. — I try to eat at regular intervals throughout the day to make sure I'm eating enough and to avoid mindless junk food snacking. I take prescribed Adderall every day, and it has really done a number on my appetite over time. I go back to the kitchen and cut up a Pink Lady apple and make a mug of the Yogi blueberry green tea, and take them back to my desk to eat with an individual container of creamy peanut butter. Then, I take a brain break and go to the American Eagle website, where I load up a cart with almost $400 worth of things I might want…and then quickly close out of the window before I make the mistake of charging any of it to my store card. My husband messages me on Skype to tell me which restaurant we're going to tonight for our friend's birthday, and I'm pumped — the one she picked is my favorite. 12:30 p.m. — Before my lunch break, I check the status of my bank account and open my Excel budget spreadsheet to log the grocery purchase I made last night. At 1 p.m., I take my break. I typically talk to my sister on the phone every day at this time. I drive through Wendy's on my way home and order a cup of chili with crackers and chili seasoning packets ($2). Then I drive the five minutes to my house to relax for a bit. When I get home, I decide I'm not hungry yet, so I leave the chili in my car to bring back to work with me to eat later. I feed our girl-cat, since she got shorted during breakfast this morning, and then climb into bed to play Solitaire on my phone and rest for a while. Five minutes before 2 p.m., I head back to the office. $2 4:30 p.m. — It's almost time to leave for the day, and my husband messages me to suggest that I make a gift for our friend's birthday. I quickly log into my Cricut design space and work up two unique designs to iron on to cute canvas pouches for her. At 5, I run out to Hobby Lobby. The set of pouches I want isn't available, so I grab a different one that I hope will work ($3.99). I also grab a package of cute on-trend paper gift bags ($9.99), and as I approach the checkout, I spy another pouch that may also work ($4.99). After my 40%-off-one-item coupon, my total comes to $15.87. At home, I get to work cutting, weeding, and ironing on my designs. I ask my husband to text our friends and let them know we're running slightly late. We're out the door by 7 p.m. for our 10-minute drive to the restaurant. $15.87 8:45 p.m. — Dinner is over and we had a great time. There were three couples and a single friend, and we sat at a round table with a fireplace in the middle. I ordered a beet and goat cheese side salad and my favorite lemongrass salmon with forbidden rice. My husband had a Caesar side salad, a cup of tomato soup (which was amazing), and a small plate of maple-glazed pork belly on creamy polenta. When the server brings our check, my husband pays ($74.28). We're back home at 9 p.m., and we change into comfy clothes to watch TV and hang out with the cats in the living room. We land on a documentary about JFK's final day and get totally sucked in. Before I know it, it's 11 p.m. and definitely time for bed. Daily Total: $17.87",1,285
"6:30 a.m. — My second alarm goes off. I grab my phone, turn off the next alarm, and check Facebook, emails, and my bank account — it's payday! I see that I received a bonus and I make a mental note to update my budget spreadsheet when I get to work. Then I'm up, out of bed, and into the kitchen, where I make coffee and feed the cats. I shower, skipping my hair again (I'm kind of pushing it at this point), and then wake up my husband before I continue getting ready. Once again, I sprint through the house and am out the door by 8:02. 9:30 a.m. — I'm getting hungry, so I head to the office kitchen for the same breakfast as yesterday. I take it back to my desk and send my husband a Venmo for my portion of the last two months of car insurance ($200). Then I go to Birchbox and re-order my favorite Supergoop CC cream ($32) and a sample pack of acid and vitamin-heavy skin care products ($25). I have $9.40 saved up in points, and I use my Honey browser add-on to find a discount code for 20% off and free shipping, which brings my total to $36.20. Bonus paydays are always spendy for me, as I use them to stock up on splurge-beauty products, household items we may be running low on, and other random purchases. $36.20 11:30 a.m. — Our boss is still on vacation, but my work wife is back today, and we want pizza. We order from a local place and my company buys — score! She runs out to pick up the pies and brings them back to the conference room, where we sit and chat while we eat. I'm taking my lunch break early today, so at 12:30 I head out. This is my sister's third week at her new job, and she's totally killing it, but she's still relearning to adapt to the workforce after being a stay-at-home mom for over a year. I make a mental note to assemble an ""emergency kit"" for her car as a gift. At 1:25, I head back to the office. 1:45 p.m. — I want to surprise my sister with the emergency kit, so I log onto AmazonSmile and quickly assemble one for her. She spends a lot of her work time in the car, traveling between different appointments. I choose a clear box with a lid, a bottle of ibuprofen, Tide To Go pens, mini-lint rollers, plastic spoons and forks, bobby pins, and a stainless-steel water bottle ($75.62). I also sign up for a free 30-day trial of Prime. I mark the items as gifts and write her a quick note. The order should arrive at her house in two days. $75.62 4:20 p.m. — Before I forget, I log into my bank accounts and to transfer some money into my savings. I need to straighten up the guest room and my craft room, and generally clean the house up a bit. Some of our favorite friends recently moved from Chicago to the city next to ours, and they're coming over on Saturday to see our new house for the first time! 7 p.m. — I get everything cleaned up and take care of other organizing tasks around the house. My husband is making dinner tonight: sautéed seasoned portobello mushrooms on top of olive oil and rosemary-flavored pearled couscous. I also roast brussels sprouts that need to be used up. After dinner, I lay on the sofa and catch up on my shows while my husband watches golf in the den. At around 10:15, we decide we're tired enough to head to bed. Daily Total: $111.82",2,285
"6:30 a.m. — Once again I've snoozed my alarm too many times. I make coffee, feed the cats, and head to the bathroom to get ready for work. I shower and wash my hair with Pureology Hydrate shampoo and conditioner and exfoliate my face with St. Ives Green Tea scrub. I wake up my husband, blow dry my hair, and get dressed. We get to wear jeans on Fridays, so it makes getting dressed a little easier, but once again I'm running late and out the door at 8:05. 9 a.m. — This Friday is just me and my work wife, and we decide to order breakfast from IHOP. I get Swedish crepes with scrambled eggs, sausage and hash browns. $11.85 1:10 p.m. — I take my lunch break and head out to Ulta to stock up on beauty goods. I pick up Drybar dry shampoo and dry texturizer (which comes with a free mini!), Ulta face primer and body spray, Formula 10.0.06 pore strips, a Soap & Glory eye mask, and Covergirl Super Sizer mascara. With $3 in reward points and a coupon for $3.50, my total comes to $83.71. Then I stop and get gas before my gas light comes on ($48.05). When I get back to work, I warm up a small dish of last night's leftovers and add dressing to the salad I packed. At 4:30, my partner tells me we can leave for the day! $131.76 6:30 p.m. — I've been puttering around the house since I got home, putting things away and straightening up in preparation for our friends' arrival tomorrow. My mom instilled in me an obsessive need for my house to be spotless for guests. My husband and I go back and forth about what to do for dinner, and finally decide on our favorite hole-in-the-wall bar around the corner. I order a burger with green olives and American cheese, and he orders nachos. We run into an old acquaintance of my husband's, who buys our first round of beers. After those, we have one more of the same, and pick up a drink for the old friend. There's a work acquaintance of mine sitting on the other side of us at the bar. He orders microwave pork rinds and we chat with him and laugh about the absurdity of such a thing…and then we buy a package to take home and try ourselves. The total comes to $26 before tip, and my husband pays. 8 p.m. — Back home and settled into the sofa for the night. We turn on the fireplace (we got gas logs installed last month and are loving it) and catch up on an episode of on History Channel — it essentially takes place in our backyard, and we love both the history and knowing that our city is getting national attention. I fall asleep during the show, and my husband wakes me up around 10:30 to go to bed. Daily Total: $143.61",3,285
"7:30 a.m. — I am baffled by my sleep patterns. During the week I have the hardest time getting out of bed before 7 a.m., but on the weekends I'm up at the crack of dawn. I make coffee, feed the cats, and eat cereal while I watch on Netflix. 12 p.m. — I shower, get ready for the day, and then go out to Old Navy to use my SuperCash. But I leave without buying anything. Then I go to the grocery store, and on my way I get a call from my sister, who received my care package and wants to know why I'm ""the best sister ever,"" which makes me feel all the feels. I pick up eggs, milk, juice, English muffins, coffee creamer, bacon, Red Bull, salsa, tortilla chips, and pretzels. After $14.08 in rewards, specials, and coupons, my total comes to $43.71. I use the prepaid rebate card I got in the mail yesterday, which I got when I got all four of my tires replaced last month. My husband texts while I'm at the store to see if I need him to do anything while he's also out and about — I don't, but I love that he asked. 5 p.m. — Our friends have arrived! We give them a tour of our house and they crack open craft beers. Then we put on our warm weather gear and take them on a hike in our backyard. Our property backs up to what used to be a sand mine, and what is now a gorgeous and mostly untouched lake. We climb the dunes and check out the view. I'm reminded again of how lucky we are to live where we do and say a quiet bit of thanks to the universe for landing us here. 7 p.m. — We're starving, so we head downtown for food and drinks. Our first stop is our local distillery, which is Prohibition-themed and specializes in old-timey drinks. My husband and I both order Chesterfields. They. Are. Divine. Our friends order a Bloody Mary and a Black Betty. We also order spinach and artichoke dip, and a giant soft pretzel with cheese sauce ($77.84, which I pay for). Our next stop is a local sandwich place. Our friends and I order gyros, and my husband orders an antipasto salad with a side of cheese balls. I have one Oberon, and everyone else has a couple rounds of a few different beers. The tab comes, and our friends pick it up. $77.84 9:30 p.m. — Our final stop is back at our favorite hole in the wall. We each order a beer (which my husband pays for), but it's 9:30 at this point and we're all getting pretty tired. I finish half of mine and tell the crew it's time to go home — I'm dying to put on my sweatpants, play games, and relax. Daily Total: $77.84",4,285
"8 a.m. — I would love to stay in bed longer, but I have a bit of a headache, and I always try to make sure I'm up before our guests in case they need anything. I down ibuprofen with a giant glass of water and make a package of roast beef ramen noodles. Then I watch more with the cats while I wait for people to wake up. 10 a.m. — Everyone is awake. I make coffee, scrambled eggs, oven bacon, and English muffins for us all. Our friends eat with us and then say their goodbyes. The rest of the day is spent glued to the sofa, watching golf and playing on my laptop. 6:30 p.m. — I make spaghetti with spicy ground turkey meat sauce and garlic bread from things we already have at home. Daily Total: $0",5,285
"6:15 a.m. — Up and at it for my usual morning routine. I make scrambled eggs and separate them into two containers for breakfast over the next two days. I shower and should probably wash my hair, but I'm too lazy. Throw my hair in a bun, put on makeup, and get dressed in a pair of black Pixie ankle pants and a leopard print sweater from Old Navy. On my way out the door, I grab the scrambled eggs, a container of leftover spaghetti, and a can of plain soda water. 10 a.m. — My boss is back from spring break but will only be in the office for a few hours today, as he has to go out of town again for a couple of days. When he arrives this morning, we have a meeting in his office where we catch up on what we've all been up to for the last week, both professionally and personally. He tells us that he ordered a “very fancy” espresso machine for our office, and my work wife shares the cost with me on the DL — I am flabbergasted but so amused, because this is very typical of my boss. We laugh about it for the rest of the day. After our meeting, I check out my bank account and update my budget accordingly. I see a charge today for Netflix ($10.99). 12:30 p.m. — I heat up leftover spaghetti and eat it at my desk before I take my lunch break. At around 1, I head home to talk to my sister and play Solitaire on my phone for an hour. The rest of the afternoon at work is busy. 4:45 p.m. — I realize I need to leave to get to my 5 p.m. massage therapy and chiropractic adjustment appointment across town. I shut the office down and head out. When my appointments are over, I pay for the visit using my husband's HSA card ($75). I look forward to these biweekly appointments, but I leave this one feeling almost more uncomfortable and in pain than I was before. I have some sort of undiagnosed injury/problem with my neck, upper back, and right shoulder, along with scoliosis. During my visit with my chiropractor, we decide that he probably can't do much more for me and he recommends that I get a referral from my primary care physician for a physical therapist. I make a mental note to log into my medical app and send my doctor a message with this request. 6:30 p.m. — Back at home, my husband and I straighten up from the weekend. We decide to get take out for dinner, and while he goes to pick it up, I take a shower and turn my bathroom into a spa. Earlier in the day, I received my Birchbox delivery with the “Acids & Vitamins” skin care kit, so I unpack it and read about what's included. I apply various creams and the eye mask I bought at Ulta earlier this week. I also soak off my old crusty shellac manicure. When my husband gets back with dinner (hot and tangy chicken wings with fries, which he paid for), we sit at the coffee table and eat together. Afterwards, I paint my nails and we watch TV for the rest of the night. Mondays always get us both, so we go to bed early at around 10 p.m. Daily Total: $0",6,285
"6:15 a.m. — I'm up on time! Such a miracle. Apparently going to bed at a decent hour helps with this. I do my usual morning routine and I'm out the door by 7:55! 9:30 a.m. — Work has been pretty chaotic this morning. I'm guessing a lot of our clients think my boss is back from his vacation, which he was…but he's gone again. Sometime in the morning we get a package from Amazon — it's the espresso machine, a day early! My work wife and I open the box…and then another box…and then another box, until we finally find the machine. We spend the rest of the morning putting it together and trying to figure out how it works, in between fielding calls from clients and completing work tasks as they pop up. We determine that the machine is too big to fit where we originally wanted to put it, and we need to get a cart to keep it on. 12 p.m. — My work wife and I are starving. She gives me her debit card and I make a trip to Qdoba to grab lunch for us. We both order essentially the same thing: kids nachos with ground beef, black beans, rice, salsa, and sour cream. I make sure to ask for lots of chips, since I usually eat it in two sittings. The meals are $4.56 a piece, and I pay for them separately on our debit cards. Before I head back to work, I talk to my sister briefly on the phone. She makes me laugh with a hilarious story about my middle niece, a savage four-year-old with sass for days and the strongest will. $4.56 5 p.m. — The rest of the afternoon flies by, which is great, because as soon as the work day is done, I'm headed to my friend's house in the next city over for dinner. I make the half hour drive to her house, and her pup greets me at the door. She's making grilled chicken and soba noodles with miso vinaigrette using a recipe from . Everything smells amazing, and it tastes amazing too. She and I take turns hosting each other for dinner every week or two. Sometimes we cook and sometimes we go out, but we always have a great time catching up. 8:30 p.m. — My friend's husband gets home from work and offers to take us for cocktails at a nice restaurant that's walking distance from their house. We sit at the bar and each order a cocktail — my friend gets a Paloma, I order an Aperol Spritz, and my friend's husband orders an Old Fashioned. My drink is wonderful, but I taste her husband's drink and immediately regret my choice — I love Old Fashioneds. The three of us chat about everything under the sun, and before I know it it's 10 p.m. My friend's husband pays our tab (three drinks for him, one for each of us girls), and we walk back to their house. I say my goodbyes and head back home. My husband is already in bed, so I crawl in and snuggle up. Daily Total: $4.56",7,285
"8:10 a.m. — I've been snoozing since 6:30, but I finally convince myself to roll out of bed, quickly get ready for work, and leave by 8:45. The trains are packed this morning and hard to get into. When I get to work, I settle in, fill up my water bottle, and grab a coffee. 10:30 a.m. — We had a department meeting today, but I decided to call in instead of attending in person. Halfway through the meeting they highlight key members of each team, and I'm the one chosen for my team! I give myself a pat on the back, since I started this job less than six months ago and sometimes I feel like I'm not living up to expectations. 12:15 p.m. — This day is dragging. There aren't many lunch options in our building, but I settle for a chicken salad/burrito bowl from one of the rotating restaurants I go to. I eat at my desk while reading Money Diaries and catching up on texts. My mom was clearing her inbox earlier and found drafts of my college entrance exam essays, which she forwarded to me. In one essay, my conclusion speaks about making myself the top priority despite outside pressures. Although I spent many years putting myself second, I'm finally starting to take care of me. Reading this was a good reminder to keep doing that. $9 2:30 p.m. — Slowest. Day. Ever. Grab a cup of coffee from the cafeteria, even though I really want Starbucks. I used to go at least twice a day for black coffee, and I've slowly cut back to making it a weekly treat. I spend time chatting with a coworker and see that someone has Swedish Fish at their desk, so I grab a few. 4:35 p.m. — While waiting for another coworker to finish with her day, I put myself together by throwing on a quick French braid through the middle top of my hair and spraying my face with Mario Badescu rose water. My hair is feeling gross — I've been trying to use less dry shampoo, as it's clogging my scalp. I also take this time to research good clarifying shampoos and add the Neutrogena Anti-Residue shampoo to my Amazon cart. I have items in my cart that my cousin who lives in a different country wanted me to get for him, so I purchase those items ($115) and the shampoo ($9). When the package arrives in two days, I'll hand off his items to my dad, as he'll be traveling there next week. My cousin will then reimburse me through my dad. $9 4:45 p.m. — Freedom at last! My coworker and I grab an Uber ($3.87 for my half) to head to a restaurant close to our volunteer orientation for a bite and drink before it starts. Her friend meets us at the restaurant, where they tell us they're hosting a happy hour special for dollar oysters, so I get four and a cider ($16). My friend orders a cheese plate, and I help her pick at it. $19.87 6:30 p.m. — My coworker's friend drives us to the orientation, where we spent the next hour and a half learning about the different volunteer opportunities through this program at the animal shelter. We lucked out, as there's a puppy in the room! 8:15 p.m. — Orientation is over, and I grab an Uber Pool home ($3.53). The guy I am seeing, G., wants to hang out tonight. I text him my ETA, and he walks over to my apartment. $3.53 9 p.m. — I beat G. to my apartment by about 10 minutes, so I quickly drop things off and then walk towards his direction, bumping into him halfway. We decide to walk around the neighborhood to see if a restaurant catches our fancy. After half an hour, we finally settle at a grilled cheese restaurant. He orders a plain grilled cheese, and I get one stuffed with mac and cheese. He pays for dinner while I get the drinks. During dinner, we talk about what the protocol should be for splitting expenses on dates. We both agree that 50/50 is the way to go, whether it's split checks or alternating purchases. I breathe a sigh of relief, since during my last relationship I paid for 75% of our dates and expenses. $22 10:30 p.m. — We finish our dinner and drinks and start walking back to my apartment, but then decide to stop in at a bar to grab more cider and beer. He pays. After about an hour, we call it a night and I grab an Uber. $2.93 11:45 p.m. — I quickly wash my face, brush my teeth, and head to bed, tossing and turning until finally falling asleep around 2 a.m. At the end of the day, Digit saved me $20.44 and Qapital saved me $284.36. Daily Total: $66.33",1,286
"7:45 a.m. — Time to slowly wake up. I have to wash my hair today, since I didn't do it before bed last night. I hop in the shower and slowly get ready. I spend my morning contemplating where I want things to go with G. We met less than two weeks ago and I feel like he's going too fast, especially since he reminded me last night that he wants me to go to his sister's wedding next month. I love the conversation and company, but I don't know if I'm ready, plus there are things I love (like food and travel) that aren't up his alley. I just got out of a seven-year relationship. Although it ended over 16 months ago, I gave myself a full year to rebuild my self esteem, practicing self love, reconnect with friends, and figure out who I am and what I want out of life. I just started playing the field a few months ago, and I don't know if I'm ready to be tied down to one person yet. I'm finally ready for work at 8:45 a.m., so I pry G. out of bed and take the train. 10 a.m. — My ex just texted me ""Good Morning."" I haven't been responding to his texts for the past four months, but he still texts me multiple times a week. I eventually blocked him for a month, but he then started texting my sister to see how I was. In a moment of weakness, I unblocked him a week ago and this is the first message I've received since then. He mastered the art of gaslighting while we were together, so I'm trying my best to not fall under that trap again. I've worked too hard, so in order for me to be able to move on, I need to try my best to cut him out. 10:30 a.m. — To distract myself, I spend some of my morning attempting to plan my trip to France and Italy next month. Between the logistics, requesting time off, and trying to contact the consulate for a visa appointment, this trip is really giving me a headache. My aunt invited us on this trip last month with my uncle and cousin, but unfortunately less than a week after the invite, my uncle suddenly passed away. When I saw my cousin at the wake, he kept asking me if I could go with them on the trip, so I said yes. I stress-eat the salt and pepper chips I find in my desk drawer. In the midst of searching for hotels, my aunt calls. I let her know where things stand, and she slightly panics and says they're not ready to be alone yet and desperately need the support as they continue to grieve. I promise her that we'll do everything to get the visas lined up so we can go and that I'll book the hotels at some point this week. 12:15 p.m. — Grab a chicken shawarma plate with hummus and salad for lunch and bring it to my desk to eat. My eyes are definitely bigger than my stomach, but that's okay. $13.86 3:30 p.m. — I take a short break from work to look at pictures of French and English bulldogs on Instagram. I really want one, but I can't have dogs at my apartment. I'm moving this summer and will eventually get one, but for now the pictures and videos will have to suffice. 5:45 p.m. — I get home from work and organize my laundry so that it's ready for pickup. I decide to hang out on my couch for a couple hours before I resume being an adult. 8 p.m. — I start a couple loads of laundry for my sheets and towels. Minutes later, I get a text that DryV is at my door to pick up the rest of my laundry. Laundry is my least favorite chore, and I find that it is much easier to outsource than to bring it to my parent's house in the suburbs or use the machines in our building. 8:30 p.m. — I heat up leftover Keto Thai Coconut Chicken that I made last week and toss in cauliflower rice. I'm weird about leftovers, but I forgot how much I like this dish. I also make a flatbread with a Flatout wrap, turkey, pepper jack cheese, salsa, and giardiniera. 9 p.m. — I decide to text my ex back and ask what exactly he wants from me. He says he just wants to see how I'm doing because he cares. It takes all of my effort to not respond back that he should've cared while we were together. He asks if it's a bad thing, and I say yes. He stops responding. I put on  to distract me while I eat the rest of my dinner. 11 p.m. — Start getting ready for bed by double cleansing, showering, and doing the rest of my nighttime routine. I ordered items from The Ordinary last month, and I decide to try the Lactic Acid 10% and HA 2%, and then layer on COSRX Advanced Snail 92 All in One Cream on top. 11:30 p.m. — I finally get into bed and see that emails came in from work — I quickly reply on my phone before falling asleep. Today, my Qapital account saved $15.88. Daily Total: $13.86",2,286
"8:15 a.m. — I roll out of bed and get ready for my day. I do my normal morning routine of washing my face, applying WonderPore toner, Stridex Red Box (BHA), Nature Republic Aloe, and Biore Perfect Milk Sunscreen. I then put on foundation, setting powder, bronzer, blush, touch of highlight, eyebrows, eyeliner, and mascara. I also run a straightener through my hair. 9 a.m. — My mom texts me on my way to work and asks if we're still going to New York in a couple weekends. I say yes and look at hotels and Airbnbs when I get to work, but get distracted before booking one. I also follow up on the email I sent the French consulate to ask for an appointment. 11:30 a.m. — The invoice for my laundry comes in at $52 for 33 pounds of laundry and they process the payment. Not bad for a month's worth of laundry. I start eating the lunch I made last night at my desk and call into a Lunch and Learn. After lunch, I grab more water and coffee and see that there are bags of Skinnypop popcorn to grab, so I get one to save for later. $52 4:30 p.m. — This afternoon has flown by! I eat my popcorn during a call. A friend texts me to see if I've bought anything for our friend's baby shower next weekend. I haven't, so I pop over to Target website and buy a car seat cover from her registry, plus a set of 3-6 month old onesies and a three-piece outfit. Whenever I buy baby clothes to give, I tend to never get newborn or 0-3 month sizes, since I assume everyone else will. I throw in a black and white tank top and black t-shirt for me to meet the $40 clothing minimum to get a gift card. $74.30 5:15 p.m. — I leave work and hop on the train to head to my Brazilian wax appointment. It's raining out and I regret not taking the bus, since I have to walk 20 minutes from the train station to the salon. At the salon they ask if I want anything else done, since they're running a promo for 13.51% off all services for an Ax The Pink Tax campaign, since women typically spend so much more than men on similar items. I don't have anything else I need to get done, so I pass, but I appreciate the campaign. I prepaid for a year's worth of Brazilians last month, so I only have to leave tip. $7 6:30 p.m. — I walk over to G.'s apartment building to meet him for dinner. We go to a trendy pizza place where he orders a pepperoni pizza, and I get a pizza with prosciutto, spinach, caramelized onion, sun dried tomato, balsamic, goat cheese, and cream cheese. We also grab beers, cider, and two cookie dough bites. He pays. 8:30 p.m. — After dinner, we go to a bar down the block for more beer and cider. My phone has a tendency to blow up after work with texts and messages, and I try to ignore it the best I can when I'm mid-conversation, but G. gets annoyed that people are messaging me. I respond to texts while he's in the bathroom or on his phone, but this is a bad habit I need to figure out — finding the balance between enjoying company but not ignoring everyone who's trying to get a hold of me. I pay for the drinks. $17 10:30 p.m. — We finally call it at night and I order an Uber. Luckily, I've had 40% off all rides for the past few weeks, so I don't mind picking up the tab. It doesn't make sense for someone else to pay more — although this discount has also skyrocketed my use of Uber from rare to multiple times a day. $6.55 11 p.m. — We get back to my apartment, and I do my nighttime routine and head to bed. My Qapital app saved me $17.95 today. Daily Total: $156.85",3,286
"3 a.m. — I wake up with the worst sore throat. I toss and turn a couple hours and can tell that G. isn't sleeping well either — probably because I'm snoring up a storm. We take turns getting up and grabbing water and adjusting ourselves. Then I move to the couch at 6 a.m. so he can get rest. 8 a.m. — I finally get up off the couch and get ready for the day. G. left a few minutes ago to get a haircut. While getting ready, I make myself hot calamansi juice and pack almonds, Trader Joe's cat cookies, and a few pieces of Tim Tams for my afternoon snack. I see a container of cottage cheese and decide to bring it with me to work for breakfast. I leave at my normal time of 8:45 a.m. 9:10 a.m. — Get to work and settle in for a busy morning. I eat my cottage cheese while working, and try to ignore my sore throat. I can't afford to catch a cold now! The Italian consulate sent me an email indicating they don't have appointments for a while, but to keep checking their site in case people cancel. I check both the French and Italian consulates to see if I can score an appointment, but no dice. 11 a.m. — Had a conversation with my boss regarding 2018 goals, and I feel good about what I need to accomplish and where I am. Just like any other job, there are headaches, but at least I'm learning to navigate them in this new job. 1 p.m. — I go upstairs to a cafe to grab hummus, carrots, and celery, but they're out for the day. Nothing else appeals to me, so I go back to my desk and eat the snack I brought. I've been spending too much money lately — dating is really expensive! I also want to get rid of my car, since I don't drive as often as I used to. I've always paid at least $500 monthly for my cars, and didn't realize how high that payment was. I want to trade it in for a more used car or a lease, but I don't want to lose money on the trade-in. I take a peek at the dealerships site to see if there's a used car that piques my interest, but I don't find anything. One weekend, I'll stop by the dealership and talk to a salesman. 3:45 p.m. — I finally get a hold of the French consulate, and they advise me to get a visa from another country in the Schengen region. Since Italy isn't available either, I try Spain, Germany, and the Netherlands. Luckily the Netherlands has appointments available in a month, and that gives my sister and I plenty of time to get the paperwork together. What a relief. 5 p.m. — I leave work and head to happy hour with a few former coworkers. I order a glass of wine and split a hamburger, fish tacos, and truffle fries with a coworker. During dinner, we have a heated debate about dating, which leads to talking about what I should do about G.'s sister's wedding. The boys say it's harmless, but the girls agree it's too fast, and soon enough half the boys jump on the girls' bandwagon after I tell them more details. They are no help! I am still confused. $18 7:30 p.m. — We leave the restaurant and a few of us head to a new bar around the corner. It takes us a while to find it, as it's buried within another bar, but it ends up being a really cool place. The tables have an old school Nintendo hooked up with 500 games. I order a Moscow Mule and they order an Old Fashioneds and beer. I pay for everyone's drinks. $38.84 9:30 p.m. — I hop on the El with one of the guys, and we both get off the same stop. We walk east towards his apartment, passing my own, as I'm meeting G. somewhere along the route to go to another bar. G. and I stop by a pub, where I order a glass of wine and he gets a discounted beer. My wine is one of the worst glasses I've ever had, so I don't even attempt to finish it. It takes us 30 minutes to get our tab, only for them to charge him full price for the beer. He pays with cash and we vow not to return there again. 11 p.m. — We get back to my apartment and see that my Amazon packages have arrived. I set aside the box with my cousin's items so I can give it to my dad next week. Then I remove my makeup and drink a cup of hot calamansi juice. G. convinces me to gargle salt water to soothe my throat, and I attempt to, but I'm skeptical. I feel slightly better and I knock out cold within five minutes of getting in bed. The Qapital app only saves me $4 today. Daily Total: $56.84",4,286
"8:15 a.m. — Well rested, I roll out of bed and get ready for the day. I'm out the door by 8:45 and say goodbye to G. 11:15 a.m. — I place an order online at an Italian cafe for a toasted sub on focaccia with hot capocollo, hot soppresatta, mozzarella, lettuce, tomato, homemade Italian dressing, and giardiniera. I pick it up and eat at my desk. My mom and I settle on a hotel for New York where we can use points, and my sister decides that she'll join the trip as well. $8.32 1:30 p.m. — I find myself dozing off at my desk, so I grab a coffee from the cafeteria. I'm really craving something sweet. My throat still really hurts, and I debate whether I want to get the Cold Buster/Medicine Ball/Honey Citrus Mint tea at Starbucks. 2 p.m. — Today is going by very slowly. I've been debating dyeing my hair lighter for summer for the last few weeks, and I finally bite the bullet and schedule an appointment for two weeks from now. Luckily, my sister has a free complimentary service at a nice salon by my apartment that she's letting me use, so I'll only have to leave tip. I browse Instagram for inspiration. 4 p.m. — I get ready to head home for the day, but someone IMs me as I shut down. I quickly resolve the issue and head to the train. Unfortunately, there's a 15-minute wait. My headphones die right before I hop on the train. It's full of middle schoolers, and their conversations are innocent and pure, which put a smile on my face. Eventually, my headphones charge enough and I listen to the podcast , which always brighten my day. 5 p.m. — I get home, quickly change to sweats, and make myself a tuna salad with tuna, carrots, giardiniera, eggs, Valentina hot sauce, and a smidge of ranch and mayonnaise. I toast frozen Ezekiel bread, which I eat with tuna salad. I get a phone call from the cleaners that they're outside, so I grab the laundry and decide to deal with it later. I settle on the couch to relax from the week and watch an episode of . 8:30 p.m. — I fall asleep during the same episode/scene of that I fell asleep to last week. I get woken up out of my nap by text messages from a few friends I made tentative plans to go out with, but I am not feeling well at all, so I let them know and head off to bed. 9:30 p.m. — My throat is progressively getting worse, and I look up symptoms of strep, since I've never had it. I'm checking off almost all the symptoms, so I talk to my mom and sister and they both agree that I have strep or mono. Unfortunately, I don't have medicine to make the symptoms better, so I will have to tough it out. 2 a.m. — After spending the night self-diagnosing and watching YouTube videos, I finally fall asleep.

"8:30 a.m. — I spend the evening tossing and turning, and wake up to a Snapchat notification, which I respond to before proceeding to sleep on/off for the next four hours. 1:30 p.m. — Finally ready to get out of bed and take a shower. I use the Anti Residue shampoo and my hair feels great afterwards. Then I put a healthy dose of Olaplex 3 in my hair to soak in. 2 p.m. — Get to the urgent care down the street and wait to be seen by the PA. The nurse takes a strep test, and it comes back negative. But when she does the physical test, she says all signs point to strep — even how my throat smells. She prescribes antibiotics and I ask if she can give me something in case I get a yeast infection. I am ordered to be quarantined for 24 hours after starting the antibiotics. She sends in my prescription to the pharmacy down the street. I pay for the visit using my old HSA from my previous job. 3 p.m. — I hop in my car to pick up the prescriptions, Tylenol, and Ibuprofen. As I'm walking out, I realized that the pharmacist did not bother telling me that the antibiotics will cancel out my birth control — which I am surprised by but also not, since so many people end up pregnant this way (or maybe I watch too much and ). I pay for the meds with my HSA (16.36). 3:15 p.m. — After the pharmacy, I drive over to Trader Joe's to pick up yogurt to take with my antibiotics. In the process I also get avocados, sweet potato gnocchi, hummus, pita chips, mango pops, and mozzarella sticks. $26.06 4 p.m. — I make mac and cheese with tuna salad from last night. I take my first dose of antibiotics and the 24-hour quarantine countdown starts now. I turn on and text G. and another FWB, B. I miss seeing B., and today is the first time in a while we're both free — but I'm not willing to get anyone sick. 10:30 p.m. — I spend the last few hours napping, texting with friends, and watching a movie that I barely pay attention to. I make mozzarella sticks and dip them in raspberry jam, which is surprisingly good. I have a bad tendency to eat like crap when I'm sick. Another FWB, T., texts me and asks if he gave me strep throat, after I posted the question on Snapchat (as a joke). I spent time with him last Sunday and he had to call off work on Monday because he wasn't feeling well. At least now the mystery is solved! I was thinking I got it from the dog at the animal shelter, because nothing else was out of ordinary during my week. I tell a few friends who I split meals and drinks with during the week in case they start to feel ill. Daily Total: $26.06",6,286
"2 p.m. — I went to bed fairly early last night, and spend the morning taking naps on and off. My stomach is upset from all the cheese I had yesterday, but I feel a ton better in general. I get out of bed with the intention of cleaning up my apartment, but I crash on the couch, watch , and snack on miscellaneous food instead. 6 p.m. — I'm finally out of quarantine, but still comfortable on my couch. G. texts to see if I want to grab something to eat and I say yes. He's been out drinking all day, and despite telling him not to leave his friends, he says he really wants to see me, so I hop in the shower and try to make myself look presentable. 7 p.m. — G. gets to my apartment and I meet him downstairs. We walk a certain direction until he spots a pizza place he wants to try. He gets a slice of pepperoni, while I get spinach and mushroom. The slice is so big I can barely finish half. I pay and we walk back to my apartment. $13.95 8 p.m. — One of my Target packages arrives, and I realize I ordered the wrong size! I'll have to return it this week. G. convinces me that is a really good show, so I reluctantly let him put on the pilot episode. I find myself enjoying it, especially since so many people have tried to get me to watch it and it never sounded like my cup of tea. (I'm more of a trash TV kind of person.) 10:30 p.m. — Off to bed early today! Daily Total: $13.95",7,286
"5:30 a.m. — Wake up bright and early in my childhood bed to my four legged alarm clock wanting to play. I've been traveling for the last ~36 hours and arrived late last night at my mom's, since she watched my animals while I was away. (She's the best!) I take the pup outside for a business trip, and then bring her back so I can get more sleep. 8:30 a.m. — I wake back up again. My mom has the dogs outside and lets me sleep in because I got home so late. I haven't slept in this much since getting my pup! I get dressed and then my mom, her boyfriend, and I head out to breakfast at the local cafe. I get my usual omelette and an amazing freshly baked croissant. My mom used to work here, so we eat for free, but I tip the waitress. $10 10 a.m. — Back at my mom's, and it's a beautiful day out. I sit on the porch reading my book and nodding off while the dogs play and my cat hunts field mice (unsuccessfully — he's still young and not a very good hunter yet!). 2 p.m. — We're all finally feeling hungry again after our big breakfast, so we head out for ice cream. I get peanut butter cup, and my mom's boyfriend pays. When we get back home, I pack up my dog and cat and drive the hour back to my place. I bring back fresh eggs from my mom's chickens — she gets about six eggs a day on average, and is always trying to give them away because she can't keep up! On the drive, I stop and fill up on gas. $43.89 4 p.m. — The dog and I head out for a long walk. After playing all weekend with my mom's dogs, she doesn't need it, but it's too nice out to stay inside. When we get home, I feed her and the cat and make eggs for myself. 8 p.m. — Normally I'd be playing with the animals around now, but they're both totally exhausted from their weekend at grandma's. I tidy up my apartment a bit and head to bed with a book. I'm more tired than I thought, and fall asleep really early! Daily Total: $53.89",1,287
"6 a.m. — Pup wakes me up bright and early as usual. I get dressed for a run, and we head out together. My girl LOVES to run and is a great running buddy. It's raining, but only lightly. We end up doing four miles and the pup is happy when we get home. I shower, get dressed (it's definitely a hoodie and leggings kind of day — it's a very casual workplace), feed the animals, and get them settled for the day. 8 a.m. — I call a Lyft Line to get to work. I usually bike, but I have a big bag to bring in today. The ride is ideal — we don't pick anyone else up. Since it's part of my commute, work pays for it. I arrive at work in about 15 minutes and get my usual breakfast of Cheerios and fruit. We get served meals at work, but I don't really like any of the hot breakfast options. ($3.46 expensed) 8:30 a.m. — Settle in for the day. I have a couple of meetings today, but nothing critical, so I can keep my head down working most of the day. 12 p.m. — Break for lunch, which today is Asian fusion-themed. Not really my thing, so I stick to the salad bar, plus get a cup of Italian wedding soup, my favorite. I eat with a friend from another team who started at the same time as me. We went through orientation together and she has become my closest work friend. Then it's back to the grind! 6 p.m. — Break for dinner. Usually I go home earlier than 6 and don't eat dinner at work, but on Monday's I go straight from work to hockey. Dinner is BBQ, so I get a tiny serving of pulled pork, a small piece of cornbread, and watermelon. It's delicious and I would get more, but I don't want to play on a totally full stomach. I also grab a Gatorade from the fridge to bring to my game. When I finish eating, I request a Lyft. $10.64 7 p.m. — Game time! I play hockey once a week. It's a co-ed league, but I'm the only woman on my team, and usually there aren't any on the opposing team, which is true tonight. It's something the guys notice but don't care about. Hockey is a really expensive sport, so most of my gear I bought second hand and have had since high school to keep costs down. The league is expensive too, because ice time costs so much, but my work has a gym reimbursement that we can use for things like this. Tonight we win, and I score a goal! 8 p.m. — Call a Lyft Line home and get lucky again that we don't pick anyone else up. I feel silly taking a Lyft when I have a car, but it's only one day a week, and it's cheaper than parking at my work. When I get home, I feed the animals dinner, take the pooch out for a walk, and crash in bed early. $8.64 Daily Total: $19.28",2,287
"6 a.m. — Woken up as usual by the animals. I take the pup out for her morning walk. 7 a.m. — Back home, I get dressed in running clothes, feed the animals, get them settled, and hop on my bike to work. After the ten-minute ride, I ditch my stuff at my desk and head out for a run. When I do track workouts, I go by myself, since pacing is not my dog's specialty. I run to a nearby track to do intervals, and get in just over five miles by the time I'm done. 8:30 a.m. — Back at work, showered, and eating my usual breakfast at my desk. Settle in for the day. 12 p.m. — I have a meeting with project partners from Europe and California. I feel like I didn't do enough prep work for this, so I promise them lots of interesting data by our next talk on Thursday. I leave feeling a little bad, but am perked up by the taco bar at lunch. 3 p.m. — Hear the news about Kate Spade and feel devastated. I loved her as a designer, but she also sounded like an awesome person from the interviews I read of her! As someone who has been suicidal before, I understand in some sense what she must have been feeling, but you can never know what someone is going through. I text my mom and we share our sadness. 5 p.m. — I head home a little bit early today to get a good walk in with the pup. This is the second night in a row I'll be out late, and I hate doing this to her, especially on weekdays. We go to the dog park where she plays with friends, and I run into a girl from my high school who I haven't seen in over nine years. We knew each other but not well, so we awkwardly catch up while my dog tries to play with hers and her dog ignores mine. After a good park session, we head home. I feed the animals and get the settled for the night. 7 p.m. — Call a Lyft Line and head to the Red Sox game ($4.50)! Again, Lyft is cheaper than driving and parking, but it still annoys me. We pick up two other people, but they're on the way and also headed to the game. It's a great game. Since I'm there with coworkers, I don't have to pay for the ticket. I get a sausage and french fries to eat ($14.50). Red Sox win 6-0, and I take a Lyft line home ($10.80). Take the pooch out for a business trip and pass out. $29.80 Daily Total: $29.80",3,287
"6 a.m. — Usual pup wake up. Realize I left my sneakers at work, so I dig out an old pair from my closet. They're ugly and worn out, but they work! Pooch and I go for an easy three miles. When we get back, we hang outside with the cat for a little bit, and then I shower, get ready for work, feed everyone, and head out on my bike. It's started raining a little, and I'm thankful my ride is short. 8 a.m. — Arrive and head to the kitchen for my usual breakfast of Cheerios — but we're all out! I have fruit and half a bagel with butter instead. I should be eating more protein at breakfast, but I don't like how cafeteria eggs turn out, and I don't like the sausage or bacon options either. Oh well. Get to work. 10:30 a.m. — Grab carrots from the kitchen for a snack break. Wednesdays are my favorite day at work because we have no meetings, so I get a lot done, but it also means a lot of time to take mental breaks, which seem to always end with me in the kitchen. 12 p.m. — We have a teammate in town from another office, so my team heads out for lunch. We go to an artisan pizza place, which is not something I usually like much, but I get a personal margarita pizza and it is SO good. I take home half in a leftover box. Since it's with coworkers, our CEO pays. On the walk back from the restaurant, I run into the same high school classmate I saw last night. We say hi again; I think we're both equally weirded out. 1:30 p.m. — Back to work! Grab a couple of peanut butter cups from the kitchen for a snack because I can't resist. 5:30 p.m. — Head home on my bike. It's turned into a beautiful day! I stop at CVS on the way home. I get my prescription refill, along with a pill slicer that the pharmacist convinces me I need, and a bottle of contact lens solution. When I get home, I get the dog and we go for a nice long walk around the neighborhood. We get home, play with the cat outside for a while, and I feed them. We do our usual nightly routine of watching and playing with toys. When the pets get tired, I pull out my laptop to do work. I don't often work outside of regular hours, but I want to get more done tonight. I put on in the background, which I've been slowly making my way through. I'm on season 14 out of 15 and finally seeing the light at the end of the tunnel — although let's be honest, the show got pretty boring after George Clooney left. I go to bed around 11. $24.75 Daily Total: $24.75",4,287
"5:30 a.m. — Pup wakes up a little early today, but I realize it's a good thing, as it gives me more time to get prepped for my meeting later. We head out for our walk. 6:30 a.m. — Back home, I get the animals settled and then hop on my bike to the office. When I arrive, I have a piece of toast with peanut butter to tide me over and get cracking on work. 8:30 a.m. — Head out for a run with coworkers. A group of us have started running lately, and while I usually prefer to go solo, it's been really fun! We do five easy miles. When we get back, I shower and get my usual fruit and Cheerios. Then it's right back to work. 12:30 p.m. — The meeting I was prepping for just finished, and I feel good about how it went! I eat lunch while reading today's Money Diary. 2 p.m. — Take a break to check on the money I spent traveling last week, and I send my mom $40 for tolls. My car used to be hers — I bought it from her when she got a new one. I'm paying it off faster than I need to because I don't like to feel indebted to her — even though it's an interest free loan (thanks, Mom!). Since it was her car, she left the E-ZPass in it and it's still hooked to her credit card. I rarely drive through tolls, but when I do, I make sure to keep track and pay her back. $40 4:30 p.m. — Every Thursday, we host a happy hour in my office. It's usually pretty casual and everyone just eats and drinks and plays board games, but this week we're celebrating the start of Pride month and have people from another companies visiting. I eat some rainbow cookies and chat with coworkers before biking home. When I arrive, I grab the pup and we head to the park. 7:30 p.m. — Back from the park, I feed the pets, watch , and then throw on while we all play. I'm tired from my late night and early morning, so we all go to bed early. I read my book, which is so riveting at this point that I want to finish it tonight and find out what happens, but I fall asleep almost instantly! Daily Total: $40",5,287
"6 a.m. — TGIF! Pup wakes me up (she's so consistent that I don't set an actual alarm clock), and we do the normal morning routine — dog walk (she wants to run, but I'm taking an extra rest day today), outside play time with the cat, get the pets settled, and bike to work. 8 a.m. — Arrive at work and treat myself to bagel Friday. I don't have a lot of meetings today, so I can get good work time in. 11:45 a.m. — Head out of work and walk 10 minutes to my therapist's office. I've been dealing with depression (persistent and periods of major depressive disorder, a.k.a. double depression) for the past five years. Right now I'm doing okay, and feeling mostly emotionally stable, but it takes a lot of work to stay there. I'm trying to maintain that with therapy and medication. Usually I see my therapist weekly, but I've had scheduling issues lately and haven't seen her in almost a month! Today is a good session, and while I leave feeling mentally exhausted, I know in the long run it's a net positive. The session costs $180, but my company covers mental healthcare in full, which is something I am extremely grateful for, so I don't have to pay anything. 1 p.m. — Back at work, I grab lunch and eat at my desk. I chug through work all afternoon and head out a little early! I grab a bag of Cheez-its from the work snack stash to have for dinner on my way out. 5 p.m. — On the way home, I stop to pick up my race number and t-shirt for a local 5k I'm running on Sunday. It's part of a week of celebrations for my neighborhood, and I'm really looking forward to it! The race cost $30, but I paid when I registered and got reimbursed with my work wellness benefit. When I get home, I get the pup out for a nice long walk and playtime in a nearby park. 7:30 p.m. — Home, and I do the usual routine of pet dinner and . I text each of my parents but realize they're both on movie dates with their respective significant others — they have more exciting Friday nights than I do. I go to bed early, read my book, and cuddle the animals. Daily Total: $0",6,287
"6 a.m. — Up bright and early, as usual. Saturday is our normal long run day, so my dog is excited to run, but we're skipping today so that I'm well-rested for the race tomorrow. Instead, we get in the car and drive to a nearby nature preserve. I take a very leisurely walk on the trails while the pooch zooms her way all around the woods and has a grand old time. 7:30 a.m. — Back home, I feed everyone breakfast — kibble for the animals, and leftover pizza for me. We all sit outside on the patio for a few hours enjoying the sun and the quickly warming temperature, napping on and off, and I scroll Instagram and finish my book — great ending! 12 p.m. — Pooch and I head out to the Pride parade. On the way there, we wander through a little community market that's part of the neighborhood celebrations. One booth is giving away popsicles, so I grab one to cool off. We get to the parade and it's great fun to watch. My dog has a good time being admired by the crowds — everyone says she is beautiful. While there, I buy a scoop of ice cream with a cookie from a food truck. They give me the wrong cookie, but when I ask to switch for the one I actually ordered, they just give it to me. Score, bonus cookie! $5 3 p.m. — Back home, we sit outside again enjoying the sun even more. It's a beautiful day! Eventually I get hungry, so I make myself scrambled eggs and feed the animals an early dinner. They're both tired from so much sun and outside time. 8 p.m. — In bed early again, I start a new book. It's a quiet weekend for sure, and I'm feeling like I need socialization, so I text friends and make plans for next week. Fall asleep feeling happy that I initiated, since I'm super introverted. Daily Total: $5",7,287
"8 a.m. — It's Saturday, but I get up super early. It's been sunny and hot in Portland, and it's making me feel so good and positive! I read in bed for a loooong time before getting up to make coffee. Then I do a quick clean of the bathroom, put in laundry, and take a shower. I hop on my computer to finish sending files and notes for a pro bono project I'm working on, which takes longer than I thought it would. Boyfriend is finally awake, so we hop on our bikes and head to the farmer's market two miles away. Before we start shopping, we get a bite to eat from one of the vendors. I order a bowl of scrambled eggs, beans, chorizo, and collards. $7.50 11 a.m. — We browse the market and buy potatoes, kale, basil, cauliflower, snap peas. A light market day for us. $15 2:30 p.m. — Back home and it's time for yard work. I pull a bunch of weeds in our garden bed, deal with overgrown raspberries, and harvest arugula. Then, my boyfriend and I clean the house. We're both hungry and have been craving hamburgers, so we go to Killer Burger to eat. I order a mushroom and Swiss burger with fries, and it hits the spot. Boyfriend has a cheeseburger. I pay for both of us. $25.68 3:30 p.m. — While we're out, we go to the hardware store for tomato cages, cleaning supplies, and garden twine ($24.63). Then we gas up the car ($33). $57.63 4 p.m. — Boyfriend convinces me to run an errand I've been putting off, which is to investigate the Saddle Library at a bike shop across town. I got a new bike last year, but the seat hurts. This shop specializes in women's bikes and lets you rent a saddle for a week before you buy to see if you like it. My boyfriend reminds me that I'll save money on transit if I bike every day, which is a good point! The saddle “library card” is $25, but the only saddle they have available in my hip-size is a very expensive one. I borrow it anyway to test it out. $25 7 p.m. — I install the saddle and take it for a spin. It feels…hard. Haha. I do more work on the pro bono project, and then research places to stay in Paris and London later this year. My tummy hurts after eating that hamburger, and now I don't want dinner! I make peppermint tea and curl up on the couch with a book. Daily Total: $130.81",1,288
"7 a.m. — Awake so early again. I make coffee, feed the cats, and then read in bed. I finish the book I've been reading, which is due back tomorrow at the library. This never happens, so I'm stoked. Then it's time for yoga — Sunday morning vinyasa flow with my favorite instructor, which is one of the highlights of my week. Afterwards, I drop off a few books at the library and pick up two more that I have on hold. Then I swing by Whole Foods for breakfast sausage, blueberries, and strawberries. $14.97 12 p.m. — Home, and my boyfriend's started making breakfast. We have potatoes, sausage, fried eggs, and more coffee. I feel eager to get started on meal prepping for the week, so I roast a bunch of cauliflower and make pesto. I walk to a coffee shop around the corner to catch up on email and reading, and buy a turmeric latte. $4.50 4 p.m. — On the walk home, my friend, T., texts me and asks if my boyfriend and I want to cook dinner at her place. Yes! Since I'm not cooking at home tonight, I do extra meal prep for the week, and cook a bunch of brown rice with lemon, peanuts, and curry leaves that I have on hand. 6:30 p.m. — We stop and pick up pasta. I bring over the pesto I made earlier, as well as leaves from my garden. On our way, another friend texts my boyfriend and me and asks if we want free tickets to see Yo La Tengo later tonight. Uh, yes! $15.17 9 p.m. — At T.'s we eat pasta, pesto, peas, tomatoes, and salad, and catch up. Then it's off to see YLT. We catch the second half of their two and a half hour set. 11:30 p.m. — Shower and bed! Daily Total: $34.64",2,288
"7:30 a.m. — I'm up! Make coffee, feed the cats, put on sausage for breakfast, and pack lunch. 8:30 a.m. — Bike ride to work! It's six miles to downtown and mostly downhill — a super chill morning ride. 12 p.m. — Heat up my rice for lunch. I see that Liz Phair tickets are on sale (!!), so I buy two. $67.88 2 p.m. — Take a break and get a coffee downstairs. $3 3 p.m. — Boss has changes to something we're presenting tomorrow. Nothing major, but for some reason I can't focus and it takes me a long time. 7:15 p.m. — Finally leave work SO late. The latest ever. I don't feel like biking, so I buy a two-hour pass and take the train home. $2.50 8 p.m. — Boyfriend made more sausage (we're on a sausage kick) and a kale salad. Meanwhile, that pro bono project I'm working on is going off the rails — it's going to print tomorrow, and one of the other designers drops out. She sends me her files to wrap up. I am so annoyed, but also always get stuck with the work. I'm too nice. Grr. 11 p.m. — Finally done and in bed. Daily Total: $73.38",3,288
"6:45 a.m. — Wake up before my alarm because cats are crawling all over me. Somehow, another designer and client on this thing have done another round of review and notes. I would normally be better about boundaries, but I feel eager to get this done, so I bring my laptop into bed and quickly update and export two new files. 7:15 a.m. — Put on coffee, shower, and eat oatmeal. Pack more rice and cauliflower. I take the train to work today, since I left my bike at the office. $2.50 9:30 a.m. — Client meeting is fine, but I feel like I didn't embody my most articulate self during the presentation. Feel a little bummed about it. I go into a work hole and put on a skincare podcast to cheer myself up. Dumb, but I love it. 12 p.m. — Lunchtime haircut!! I just started going to a real hairstylist, one who gives me a standing appointment, and it is so, so, so great. I used to always forget about haircuts until my bangs would drive me nuts. Now it's a fun thing I get done on a schedule. Hairstylist has a new boyfriend who she tells me all about, and there's a cute dog in the salon. It's beautiful inside — full of plants and windows. Ahhh. Expensive, but worth it. $60 5 p.m. — Time to bike home! It's hot and I'm hangry. Once I'm home, I immediately put water on to boil capellini, and then make a big pan of noodles with brown butter and sage (from the garden!!). Dude and I scarf it down. 7 p.m. — I'm doing a couple design-related research projects, and tuck into reading and writing all night long. 10 p.m. — Shower, snuggles, and bed! Daily Total: $62.50",4,288
"6:30 a.m. — I'm up early again! I'm in a good cooking groove lately, so I decide to cook something for lunch later. I put lentils, ginger, and spices on to boil, and steam broccoli while I take a quick shower. Then it's time for coffee, cat feeding, and catching up on a few emails. Boyfriend gets up, and I make us both smoothies with frozen blueberries, banana, and leftover kale. 9 a.m. — Bike ride to work. I get some great work news today — some clients got us content and feedback that we've been waiting on. This means I get a full day in my creative zone moving the project forward. No meetings, all design time. Yay. 12 p.m. — Eat my lentils and then take a walking break for coffee. $3 5:30 p.m. — Bike ride home. I have to stop by the library for two more (!) books on hold. I swear, they always become available at the same time. I am so tired today and take my sweet time biking the last few miles home. The bike seat is not feeling so great today. 7:30 p.m. — Somehow I get a fire under my butt and scramble to yoga class. I plop down next to the giant palm and monstera. The instructor makes us do a lot of planks and core stuff, but class is still relaxing. 9:30 p.m. — Home. Heat up more lentils and broccoli. Dude is out watching basketball, so I decide to make hummus! Then it's shower and bedtime. Daily Total: $3",5,288
"6:30 a.m. — I'm up. Nobody watered the garden yesterday, so do it in my PJs and harvest a bunch of raspberries. I have a fun morning — I'm going to Portland State to review some design students' thesis projects. I have to be there at 9, so I make a smoothie, pack a weird lunch of miscellaneous fridge veggies, and hop on the train. I have a day pass saved from a couple weeks ago, so I don't have to buy a ticket. 12 p.m. — Thesis reviews were FUN! Feeling very inspired by the students and their project ideas. The instructor, two other reviewers, and I all decide to get lunch. We go to a cart next door and I get a bowl with pork, kimchi, and rice. $11 3 p.m. — A (challenging) client puts a hold on a launch we were planning to do next week, which throws us all for a loop. I can't focus on much else after this. 6 p.m. — Home and everything's a mess: the kitchen drain is stopped up and the sink is full of water (?!), and one of the cats peed on the floor next to their litter box — ahhh. I furiously clean the cat zones and litter boxes. Dude picks up Thai food for dinner and pays. 9 p.m. — I am in a bad mood and over this day! Go to bed super early. Daily Total: $11",6,288
"7 a.m. — Wake up to the news of Anthony Bourdain's passing. This breaks my heart — I am a huge fan. I actually cry (!!) in bed, and then suck it up and call a plumber to deal with our sink. 9 a.m. — It's a work-from-home Friday, which my office tries to do in the summer. So thankfully I get to laze around, and the plumber is able to come immediately! He de-clogs our sink quickly ($209) and gives me a quote for other work we need done in the basement. $209 12 p.m. — It's time to break for lunch. Whenever I work from home, I like to go to this special, extremely delicious Vietnamese soup place that's packed on the weekend. I order chicken pho, and it's soooooo good. $11 6 p.m. — Got tons of work done today! Feeling good and ready for the weekend. 8 p.m. — Boyfriend's home and we decide to watch all the episodes of that we haven't seen, to honor Tony B. I make a big pot of spaghetti and tomato sauce with butter and onion, plus salad from the garden. We eat on the couch and snuggle. Daily Total: $220",7,288
"7:30 a.m. — Wake up. The BF slept over and I'm feeling myself, so I try to initiate some morning lovin'. No dice! I love when he stays over, but I have an early start today, so I dress, kiss him goodbye, and head out the door with some fruit in hand for the road. 8 a.m. — I stop by a Staples that's slightly out of the way to print some documents to bring to the doctor. I hate having to do this, but I don't own a printer and don't like the awkwardness of printing personal documents at work. $2.17 8:30 a.m. — I stop by McDonald's to pick up a hash brown on my way into the doctor's office and to use the restroom. $1.51 9:35 a.m. — Leave the doctor's and head to the office. I reload my transit card for the next two days, using a debit card already earmarked for transit with pre-tax monies. $10 10 a.m. — I finally arrive at work and hunker down for the day. I'm still fairly new, so I'm excited to be here, even though I know today is going to be a slow day. 12:30 p.m. — The president of the company invites me to lunch. I get a burger and sweet potato fries from a new spot and make the grave mistake of paying for my own meal before realizing that she fully intended to pay. *Facepalm*. She's a super knowledgeable Asian-American woman at the top of her game in a field with more homogeneity than the sales floor at a Vineyard Vines, so I hang onto every word she says. $11.71 6 p.m. — I leave work and head home. I have to stop at the Apple Store because my headphones have spontaneously decided to kick the bucket and I refuse to do just about anything without music. $31.57 7:30 p.m. — I make a pitstop at the Caribbean food place right near my apartment to pick up a quick bite because I'm feeling drained and am not in love with anything in my fridge right now. I can tell this is going to be an expensive week. $6.50 Daily Total: $63.46",1,289
"11 a.m. — At work and feeling very peckish. I go to the deli next door and contemplate buying a Rice Krispies treat, but settle for some cranberry and nut trail mix instead. $5.59 5 p.m. — On the way home from work, I pick up a small bag of candy. This (along with fried chicken) is my biggest vice. Sour gummy worms are just so delicious! $2.78 11 p.m. — I spend several hours browsing online for skincare products. I'm trying to be get into a more thorough regimen, but have had some difficulty getting started. I take a quiz on Renee Rouleau's website, which tells me my exact skin type (oily, occasional acne, anti-aging —accurate!), and deeply consider buying the suggested products. 12 a.m. — Instead of buying them, I resolve to buy the key suggested ingredients in slightly cheaper products as a test. I browse around for a while and ultimately purchase some retinol, Vitamin C moisturizer, and double cleansing K-beauty products on Amazon Smile (where a portion of the proceeds go to the charity of your choosing!). $36.93 Daily Total: $45.30",2,289
"7 a.m. — I wake up and make a smoothie for breakfast to take to work. Mangoes, peaches, orange juice, and a little cayenne pepper. Something that'll wake me right up. 9:30 a.m. — I take my time this morning getting ready, so I'm a little later than I want to be. Work is starting to pick up: I'm still getting familiar with the clients I work on, so I plug in and spend the next few hours with my head down. 12:30 p.m. — I break for lunch and head to the deli next door to get an eggplant parm sandwich, only to learn that they're out of eggplant. Cruel! I settle for an albacore tuna wrap instead. I love cooking and usually try to bring lunch four out of five days of the work week, but I neglected my grocery shopping this week and am paying the (exorbitant) price. $11.13 5 p.m. — I leave the office and make my way back to the city. I have some more skincare rounds to make, so I queue up my route on Google Maps. 5:45 p.m. — I stop and pick up a gentle apple face wash and several masks from a K-beauty store. I'm going to try some acids for the first time, so I want something simple and moisturizing to complement the chemicals. $16.55 6 p.m. — I add another unlimited seven days to my MetroCard. $32 6:30 p.m. — I make my way to Deciem, where I pick up a lactic acid solution. I'm excited to try some new products in my routine, but definitely don't want to spend an arm and a leg for something that might not work. My friend is gifting me her salicylic acid, so I'm covered on all the key products I was looking for. $7.08 7 p.m. — Final stop of the night. I pick up some sunscreen from the pharmacy to protect my skin while using these photosensitive products. I've never worn sunscreen on a regular basis before, but I'm planning on replacing it with my moisturizer during the day. $19.99 8 p.m. — Finally home. I try my new products and settle in for the night. Fridays are my night in, as I'm usually exhausted from the work week. I do some reading for the next few hours and take it easy. Daily Total: $86.75",3,289
"8 a.m. — I wake up and get ready for the day. Some friends are running a race; I'm going to support them, but I'm mostly looking forward to brunch after! I take my time with my morning routine and make sure to rub in the sunscreen all the way. No white cast, please. 12:45 p.m. — We have brunch at a lovely Mexican restaurant, and the drinks are a-flowing! The vibe is so great and I don't want it to end. We talk about books and television and a multitude of other topics just enjoying each other's company. The bill comes and we all split evenly. We get a discount due to poor service, so it's all cheaper than expected! $25 2:45 p.m. — Some of us decide to take the long walk back home. I have afternoon plans with a friend, so I peel off to go decompress and meet up with her. 4 p.m. — I bike over to my friend's apartment and we decide to go get mani/pedis. There's a cheap salon nearby and I get the most basic and inexpensive option available, so I feel good about it. $31 5 p.m. — After our beauty sesh, we decide to walk around, and I stop for a donut and water. I love hanging out with her because we get into the deep stuff in our lives very easily and speak openly about everything. She helped me through the nitty gritty of my very first relationship last year, so I feel particularly close with her. I always feel lucky and grateful when my friends want to hang out, as I have been finding myself spending an increasing amount of time feeling friendless and lonely lately. $3 7 p.m. — I leave my friend and bike home. As an introvert, lots of social activity always leaves me feeling very exhausted, so I'm excited to spend time vegging out now. I mentally decide to finding a therapist. I know it will help me to work through some of my issues, but the process of finding one is so daunting that I always give up halfway. Daily Total: $59",4,289
"10 a.m. — I'm up! I'm feeling productive today, so I make sure to put grocery shopping highest on my list of priorities. I select a recipe from my cookbook that I want to try this week (my aim is to try a new one every week), make a grocery list, and head out the door. 11 a.m. — I get to Whole Foods and it isn't too packed, but I can see the line is starting to pick up. I purchase raspberry cookies, frozen vegetables, orange juice, tilapia, chicken thighs, rosemary, frozen lasagna, tomatoes, lots of yogurt, turmeric, oregano, berries, oranges, garlic, lemons, apples, brown rice, granola, and bananas, and rejoice that my total is slightly under my weekly budget! I have a rule that whatever the difference is between my spending and my budget, I apply it to a savings goal. Right now I'm working towards a motorcycle. Every little bit counts! $74.42 12:30 p.m. —  Since I couldn't find them at the supermarket, I pick up mozzarella and cereal from a local shop on the way home. $9.48 1:30 p.m. — With the rest of my afternoon ahead of me, I decide to go get a laser facial! I make an appointment and head over to TriBeCa. 3 p.m. — Facial done, and I pay for it with a coupon I received over a year ago. I text the BF and we decide to go see a movie later, which I am very jazzed about. 4 p.m. — I spend time at home meal prepping for the rest of the week before the movie. I make a one pot chicken and rice meal in my Dutch oven and oven roast the tilapia. I snack on cookies while I work over the stove. 7:30 p.m. — We meet up a bit before the show and decide to get hot chocolate. I put on my big girl skirt tonight and finally address some of the problems I've been having with him, which I am very proud of myself for doing. I love him and love having him around, but I realize I need to be a little less easygoing. He apologizes and says he'll strive to do better, which I believe. $3.27 11:30 p.m. — Free movie (thanks MoviePass!) is over, and we head home. I see that my Amazon products have arrived, and I'm very excited to try them! Double cleansing will be the only way I wash my face from now on. 1 a.m. — My friend calls me up and we decide to finally drop the guap on some tickets. I buy two and she buys two, so it's an even split and no Venmo-ing needed! $221.70 Daily Total: $308.87",5,289
"7:30 a.m. — I'm up and at 'em this morning and have a bowl of cereal while getting ready. I swallow the pill and check my credit card balance, because I know I've over-indexed on spending. While dating my awful ex, I got into the nasty habit of not looking at my balance, and found myself in a less than manageable financial situation as a result. I know I still have a ton of work to do to set myself straight, but the first step is being realistic about my debt. 8:45 a.m. — I refill my transit card on the way in to cover the next few days when I know I'll be working from the office. $20 12:30 p.m. — Lunch time! I whip out my chicken and rice and throw it into the microwave. It's sooo delicious, but I'm worried I'll get sick of it throughout the week. 3 p.m. — I spend time reading R29 and browsing the web for apartment furnishing and decorating inspiration. Then, I send emails to various brokers to cancel my upcoming appointments and showings. I was gung-ho for months on end about moving into my own place soon, but after speaking to my mom, I've all but decided I'm better off putting that money into a savings plan. So instead, I've committed to doing up the space I currently have! 4 p.m. — I have a check-in with my boss to discuss a new campaign we're running for our client. I'm learning that even though we've only worked together a short while so far, he trusts my work and my instincts, so when I push back or really advocate for something, he concedes. It's a complete 180 degree difference from the relationship I had with my previous boss, so I feel empowered to do good work! 9:45 p.m. — I have a late night tonight getting campaigns up and running, so my boss says I can come in at 10 tomorrow. Hooray! I head home, where I promptly do my nighttime skincare routine and fall asleep. Daily Total: $20",6,289
"8:30 a.m. — I wake up a little late and lay in bed questioning my life. I need to get up and out, but I'm feeling so sleepy. I resolve to just be late to work this morning. We all do that sometimes, right? 10:30 a.m. — I arrive to the office and immediately get to work. I send a friendly reminder email to HR about getting items for my desk and computer to help me be my best work self, and she finally orders them. My day is going to be full of meetings, so I strap in for a long, unproductive day. 12 p.m. — I've made it through my first client call, which ran entirely too long. We tend to get too in the weeds on these calls, so I'm going to work on my end on how to deliver takeaways and action items thoroughly, but efficiently, so that I can actually have time to do the work. 12:30 p.m. — I have my delicious lunch and try to get work done before my next few calls. Inevitably, I take a quick break around 2:30 to grab coffee and a sweet treat from the coffee shop nearby. A brownie sounds delicious right about now. My coffee order is always expensive because I always ask for soy milk and a double shot, so I try not to get coffee too often. $10.04 3 p.m. — I settle down for another few hours of external and internal meetings, all the while wishing I could be somewhere else. 5:30 p.m. — My day is more or less shot at this point, but I commit to cranking out at least another hour of work to set myself up for tomorrow. 7 p.m. — Free at last! I head out and make my way home. I finish the book I'm working on and update my Goodreads profile. I'm about halfway through my reading goal this year and trying to read more non-fiction. I've heard a lot of good things about and I loved the original article, so I purchase through Amazon Smile. $9.18 8 p.m. — I finish a sample of , which I've had on my Kindle for months now, and am hooked, so I buy it through Amazon Smile. I can't wait to dive in all night! $13.99 Daily Total: $33.21",7,289
"6 a.m. — I'm on the East Coast for a conference. I've been working 15 hour days for the past four days, and today is my last full day before flying home tomorrow. I set my alarm an hour early each day to try to squeeze in a workout in my hotel room. Even though I desperately need more sleep, I find I have so much more energy if I can carve out a few minutes for exercise. I peel myself out of bed and pull up a pilates work out on the Beachbody On Demand app on my phone. There's a lot of lying down in pilates, so I tell myself it's almost like staying in bed for an extra 30 minutes. Then I shower, get dressed, and head downstairs for an all-day marketing summit with my team. Breakfast is waiting in the conference room. 12 p.m. — We break for lunch. I find a quiet corner in the lobby to check email and make a couple of calls before heading back to the main meeting room where a lunch buffet of fajitas and various salads is waiting — not too bad. One of the small perks of business travel is skipping meal prep and planning. But after a week on the road I'm eager to get back to healthier food options at home. 6 p.m. — After the meeting wraps up, we head to dinner. We've been with customers for the past four days straight — day and night — but tonight it's a casual low-key dinner with just my team to celebrate a successful meeting. Everyone is pretty tired, so after dinner and a nice bottle of wine we walk back to the hotel together and call it a night. Dinner is expensed, $280 including tip for four the of us. 9 p.m. — The minute I walk into my hotel room, I get a text message from a former colleague who's in town for the conference also. He's out for drinks with a few friends. My bed is calling my name, but this is my last chance to catch up with him before heading home tomorrow. I meet him at a hotel bar, where we order several rounds of cocktails. He gives me great career advice and covers the drinks (his expense policy is more generous than mine). By 1 a.m. I'm thinking about my early morning wakeup call and flight, so I say goodbye and head back to my room. I set my alarm for 5:30 and am asleep the second my head hits the pillow. Daily Total: $0",1,290
"5:30 a.m. — I hop out of bed with plenty of energy, ecstatic that it's time to go home. No time for a workout this morning. I throw on leggings, a light sweater, and booties — my travel uniform — and am out the door by 6:30. It's about a 40-minute Uber ride to the airport. ($50 expensed) 8 a.m. — Once I'm through security, I search the terminal for the best breakfast option. I find a coffee bar and order a latte, egg sandwich, and large bottle of water for the plane. ($11.50 expensed) 11 a.m. — I have a 90-minute layover in Houston. There are more dining options here than at Dulles this morning. I settle on a sashimi sampler and large mineral water at a cool-looking lounge next to my gate. I pass the time listening to an audiobook until it's time to board. Next stop: HOME!!! ($34 expensed) 2 p.m. — After landing in Orange County, I pick up my suitcase at baggage claim and grab a Lyft. My parents had been trading off dog-sitting my dog (a three-year-old rescued greyhound) at my house, so she's waiting at home when I arrive. I'm so happy to see her. I have the rest of the afternoon off, so we go for a nice long walk around Balboa Island — her favorite. $12 4 p.m. — Back to reality. I head to Trader Joe's to restock groceries. I don't have the energy to make a full meal plan for the week, so I just pick up my go to essentials: boneless skinless chicken breast, ground turkey, a couple of sweet potatoes, organic red bell peppers, organic free range eggs, Greek yogurt, green apples, steel cut oats, and — because I don't want to cook tonight — a frozen pizza. Once I'm back home, I put away my groceries, feed the dog, start laundry, and pop the pizza in the oven. I grab a La Croix from the fridge while I wait for the pizza to cook and vow to take a break from wine for a few days. Business travel always takes a toll on my eating/drinking habits. $44.03 Daily Total: $56.03",2,290
"6:30 a.m. — I'm up before my alarm (still on East Coast time, perhaps). I pull on yoga pants, a t-shirt, and shoes, and head out the door with the dog for our morning walk. I was nervous when I adopted her that I wouldn't be able to make the time to exercise her daily, but it's the best part of my day and I look forward to the quiet time outside and getting a few steps in before my day starts. Because I didn't do any cooking last night, I don't have anything ready for breakfast or lunch today (fail). I place a Starbucks mobile order on my phone app before heading out the door, and pick it up on my way to work. $7.90 12 p.m. — It's been a busy morning. There are a ton of emails to catch up on after being out of the office for a week, plus there are several new action items to track from our marketing summit on Monday. I call a lunch meeting with my team to work through the details and come up with an action plan. I feel guilty that no one has had any time off after working through the weekend and being away from their families for a week, but the weekend is only a couple of days away, and I try to focus on that. I order lunch to be delivered to the office for our meeting. ($35 expensed) 5 p.m. — I head home, change into workout clothes, take the dog for a walk, and then do a 30-minute workout at home from my Beachbody On Demand app. I cook a chicken breast and sweet potato for dinner and then the ground turkey with bell pepper, black beans, and taco seasoning for my lunches for the rest of the week. I also make a batch of steel cut oats for breakfast for the next few days, which I'll eat with diced green apple, walnuts, and coconut flakes. By 10 p.m. I'm pretty tired, but I spend another 30 minutes snuggling with my dog before going to bed. Daily Total: $7.90",3,290
"6:30 a.m. — I'm up for my walk with the dog. I notice that a scratch on her face isn't getting better, so I make a quick trip to Petsmart to pick up two different types of solution and a cone collar to try to keep her from scratching ($86.17). When we get back to the house, I wrestle with her for about 20 minutes trying to get the cone on and the ointments on her scratch. She's pretty upset. I wish I could explain that I'm trying to help her. I notice that her kibble is running low, so I place an order on Chewy.com ($47.40). Pet expenses are no joke. After all of this, I'm running late for work. I don't sweat it too much, though, since I've been working nonstop for 10 days. I pack up oatmeal for breakfast and turkey taco meat for lunch and then head out the door. Thank goodness I only have a 10-minute commute. $133.57 4 p.m. — I leave the office early. I'm exhausted, and I have things to get done at my house this afternoon. I'm leaving for a bachelorette party in Vegas tomorrow. The thought of packing up and leaving town again so quickly is daunting, but fortunately it's just for one night. I throw a bathing suit, a couple of dresses, and some other essentials in a small suitcase, and then turn my attention to my regular evening routine: dog walk, 30-minute Beachbody workout, leftovers for dinner, TV, stay up later than I should petting the dog, and then go to bed. I decide that the dog needs a different kind of bed, so I place an order on Chewy.com. I admit that some of this spending could be driven by dog mom guilt for being gone so often. $65.24 Daily Total: $198.81",4,290
"6 a.m. — I'm up a little early to get everything done before my flight to Vegas. I walk the dog and squeeze in a workout. I eat a healthy breakfast of oatmeal, apple slices, walnuts, and egg whites for protein. Then I drop the dog off at a daycare/boarding place down the street, and have a bit of time back at the house to tidy up before ordering an Uber ($6.95) and heading to the airport to catch my flight. It's a short 45-minute flight to Vegas, and as soon as we're airborne, I feel relaxed — I really needed this quick getaway. I booked the flight with airline points, so it feels like even more of a treat. I take a taxi to the hotel ($38.87 including tip) in Vegas. I probably could have saved a lot with a Lyft. $45.82 11 a.m. — I arrive at the hotel and meet up with a few of the girls. We head straight to the pool and order a round of drinks. I pick up the tab for Bloody Marys for myself and the bride. $44 for two drinks — WTF??? I will be savoring every last drop of this overpriced beverage, and I think twice before ordering another. $44 12 p.m. — We secure a couple of day beds at the pool, which come with a food and beverage minimum. I order a turkey sandwich and a cocktail and Venmo the maid of honor $50 for my share of the bill. Later in the afternoon, drinks are free with our wristbands. We make the most of happy hour and down a few cocktails at the pool bar. Eventually we head up to the room to get ready for the evening. $50 5 p.m. — I stop at the convenience store on the lobby level for a bunch of 5-Hour Energy shots and gum. We're not as young as we once were, and partying into the wee hours after drinking at the pool all day is going to take strategic planning and reinforcements. The bride's sister has stocked the rooms with water, booze, and healthy snacks, so we nosh while getting ready. $25.94 10 p.m. — A private party bus comes to pick us up and drive us around the strip. The cost is $99 per person and includes unlimited drinks on the bus (though the drinks aren't great). We dance the night away on the bus and at a handful of clubs. $99 2 a.m. — Toward the end of the night, I'm desperate for a decent drink and buy a round for a myself and a few of the girls ($73.25). It's almost 2 a.m. and we're all ready to head back. The bus drops us off at the hotel and we make a stop at the café downstairs for a late night meal before going back to the room. I order a grilled cheese, which sets me back $17.70. $90.95 Daily Total: $355.71",5,290
"8 a.m. — I'm up before everyone else, because I have to catch an early flight back to Orange County to make it back for another friend's wedding later today. Two of my closest friends are getting married less than a month apart, and it has been impacting my spending. Fortunately, neither of the girls had a traditional wedding party, so I'm spared the burden of buying a dress and matching shoes that I'll never wear again. This time I use Uber to get to the airport, and it's about half the cost of a cab. $19.95 10 a.m. — At the airport, I grab an egg bagel sandwich along with a coffee and large water. It's everything I need to stave off the hint of a hangover that's creeping in. $11.67 11:30 a.m. — Back in Orange County, I pay $28 for airport parking and head to doggy daycare to pick up my pup. I pay $66 for her stay, plus teeth cleaning. She's very happy to see me. We make a stop on our way home to take a leisurely walk on the bluff. When I get home, I have leftover taco meat and sweet potato for lunch. I need a nap if I'm going to survive the wedding tonight. $94 2 p.m. — I realize that I didn't give myself enough time to get ready, so I decide to seriously lower my expectations for the level of glamming up I'm going to do. I manage to shower, wash and dry my hair, and finish getting ready in under an hour. I order a Uber and I'm off to the wedding ($10.55). At the ceremony, I locate a handful of friends from business school that I haven't seen in a while. We're seated at the same table for the reception and we have a great time catching up all evening. The wedding is gorgeous, with a view overlooking the harbor. We dine, drink, and dance the night away while the DJ keeps the party going. $10.55 11 p.m. — As the reception winds down, we make plans to meet up at a bar close by. I hop in an Uber with some friends, but when we get to the bar I realize how tired I am and decide to call it a night. I order another Uber to take me home. I feel guilty for leaving my dog alone all night, so I cuddle with her for about an hour before going to bed. $12.99 Daily Total: $149.16",6,290
"8 a.m. — No alarm needed today. It's the first time in a long time that I don't have something to do first thing in the morning. I take the dog for a walk and feed her, and then prepare eggs, sweet potato, and black beans for breakfast. I take my time eating and drinking coffee while flipping through a magazine. I haven't had a full day at home in weeks, and my to-do list is a mile long, but I'm not in a hurry to get started. I jot down a couple ideas for meals and a make a grocery list. Eventually I head to Sprouts to pick up chicken breasts, ground turkey, broccoli, cauliflower, onions, bell pepper, mushrooms, apples, coffee, yogurt, prosciutto, cheese, and La Croix. $45.03 5 p.m. — Despite the fact that I've got a freshly stocked fridge and pantry, I have an intense craving for pizza. I cave and order a mushroom pizza from my favorite place nearby. I pick it up and enjoy half of it when I get home, saving the rest for later. Then I prep some meals. I really need to get back on track with cooking for myself more and eating out less. As the evening winds down, I glance at my work email and think about my upcoming week. The weekend flew by way too fast. I set a couple of goals for things I'd like to get done during the week, both at work and personally. Then I listen to a podcast for about 30 minutes before dozing off to sleep. This was a wild week between work travel, the wedding, bachelorette events, dog duty, and the standard daily grind. I like the variety, but at some point I wouldn't mind a more “normal” pace and schedule…whatever that means. $13.99 Daily Total: $59.02",7,290
