(He works from home but travels several days a month, and I also work from home, as a freelance lawyer.) Both our kids are awake by 6:40 a.m. this morning, so I get them changed and then give my son oats with raisins. He fishes out the raisins to eat and loudly proclaims he doesn't like oats (yesterday he loved oats, LOL). I make myself a couple of shots of espresso with our Nespresso machine and froth up almond milk for a faux latte. I take sips of my coffee between trying to coax more breakfast into my son and spoon-feeding baby food to my daughter.  $7.63 8:30 a.m. \u2014 I put the baby in the stroller, and we walk my son to preschool. I walk back home with my daughter, nurse her, and play with her for a while before our part-time nanny arrives to watch her. Then I head to my \"office,\" which is our guest bedroom. I started working from home this year, and my life is approximately a BAZILLION times better now than it was when I had a full-time office job. I used to make three times as much money as I make now, but I would never go back. I probably lost 10 years of my life from doing that job, particularly after I had a kid. I feel like I have my life back now, and I wake up grateful for it every single day. Advertisement 9:30 a.m. \u2014 I log onto my computer and see an email from Sephora that today is the last day of 10% off for Beauty Insiders. I'm out of moisturizer, shampoo, and conditioner, so I place a big order (First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Cream, Caviar Moisture Shampoo by Alterna, and DevaCurl One Condition Decadence Conditioner). This should last me 12 to 15 months, but (gulp) it's expensive. I get 2.5% cash back on this order through Ebates. I'm that person who always prowls for a coupon code or cash-back opportunity with every purchase. My husband and I are both from families that had no money growing up, and even though we make enough to pay our bills and put money aside, I still have money anxiety.  $120.24 12 p.m. \u2014 I work for a couple of hours and then heat up leftover brown rice with kale and white beans, which I eat topped with a couple of fried eggs. It's delicious and healthy. I text with my husband while I eat. We're trying to decide when to fly out to see some of his family this summer, so we're comparing airline prices so we can figure out how to see his family without spending a fortune. 3 p.m. \u2014 I need to get a few groceries, but my daughter needs to nap. Every parent knows the nap conundrum. To avoid having to get her in and out of the car if she falls asleep, I decide to walk her in the stroller to the grocery store instead. It's two and a half miles roundtrip, and I'm a sweaty mess by the time we're done, but she naps and I get milk, chicken breast, bananas, celery, and bread. After I put away the groceries, I peel a grapefruit from my fridge and eat half as a snack.  $25.65 Advertisement 5 p.m. \u2014 We pick up my son and head home. I get started on a chicken, rice, and vegetable stew for dinner, using the chicken and celery I just bought along with rice, onion, carrots, and homemade stock I already have at home. I blend some of it up for my daughter as baby food and save the rest for tomorrow's dinner, because it won't be ready until after my son's dinnertime tonight. My son requests an egg and meat burrito, so I quickly make one for him. I forage in the fridge and see that my Swiss chard is on its last legs, so I saut\u00e9 it with some spinach from my garden and sad-looking red leaf lettuce from the crisper drawer. I eat the greens with a salmon burger patty and some bread. It's a pretty random meal, but I absolutely hate throwing away food, so I try to use up whatever I have in my fridge before it goes bad. 7:30 p.m. \u2014 After the kids and I play for a couple of hours, I get my daughter changed, nurse her, and put her down, hoping she'll fall asleep easily so I can get my son ready for bed without hassle. No such luck. She's screaming bloody murder, so I alternate between tending to her, getting my son changed into PJs, reading books, and getting him down in his room. My husband texts me that he's done with work. (He had to pay for parking today ($12.50) and got a burger for dinner near where he's staying ($11.70).) This time around, he's crashing on a friend's couch, so we don't have to spend the 100-something bucks for a hotel room. We chat on the phone for a couple minutes about our days and laugh about our toddler's antics.  $24.20 Advertisement 10:30 p.m. \u2014 I drink a pot of mint tea. I'm exhausted, so I get in bed with my phone (mistake!). I catch up on the news \u2014 so much terrible stuff going on. My mind is racing. I know, I know, never look at your phone in bed, especially when the world is a garbage fire. Working on it. Daily Total: $177.72", "day_two": "Day Two: 5:59 a.m. \u2014 Well, my daughter woke me up four times last night, and now my son wakes me up for the day. Feel like I was hit by a truck. He wants to cuddle, though, so that makes me happy, and I gladly cuddle him for a few minutes. My daughter is up shortly after that and we repeat yesterday's morning routine. A couple espresso shots and almond milk for me, waffle with PB&J for my son, baby food for my daughter. 7 a.m. \u2014 We're having cement work done outside our house and the cement guys are here. I let them into the backyard. The estimate for their work was $3,300, so it will be painful later in the week when we write that check, but we don't have much choice but to get this work done because the house has drainage/grading problems and we can't let rainwater keep pooling into the base of the house every time it rains. Until we bought this house last year, we'd been lifelong renters, and I really appreciate how easy renting was. I'm still not convinced owning a home is necessarily worth it. Advertisement 9 a.m. \u2014 Walk my son to school. He's happy at dropoff and waves goodbye to me as he runs off to play. Heart bursting. Get home and the nanny is here, so I go to my office and start work. I snack on the rest of the grapefruit from yesterday. My husband had to pay for parking again today ($12.50).  $12.50 9:40 a.m. \u2014 Take a break to nurse the baby. Back to work. Client calls and drafting discovery all morning. 1 p.m. \u2014 Another break to eat lunch and nurse the baby. I eat leftover buckwheat groats with pan-saut\u00e9ed ground beef and onions. I also grab a small piece of chocolate that a friend brought me as a souvenir from Iceland. I update my work to-do list after lunch before hopping back into work. In addition to being a coupon-hunter, I'm a list-maker. To-do lists up the wazoo, for work, house projects, kid stuff, vacations. You name it, I'll make a list for it. 3:30 p.m. \u2014 Done working. I play with the baby and then unload a box of groceries from Sun Basket that just arrived. (We're charged $58.93.) We've been trying a few meal delivery subscription boxes with discounts this month to see if they're worth it. This is my fourth and last one. Even though it's nice not having to think about what to buy and cook for dinner, it's too expensive per meal, so I confirm that the subscription is canceled after this week. My husband texts me that his work trip went really well, so we exchange celebration GIFs. That's modern romance for you. He'll be home in a few hours. Yay!  $58.93 Advertisement 5:30 p.m. \u2014 Get my son from school and then we play at home. I heat up the chicken stew I made yesterday and the pur\u00e9ed version for the baby. My son loves it and asks for crackers to go with it. I eat a bowl and am still hungry, so I microwave some store-bought frozen mini soup dumplings. They're pretty good. Then I clean up and we play more. My husband bought a chicken dish from a food truck for his dinner before hitting the road ($14.11).  $14.11 8 p.m. \u2014 Husband just got home, and I'm exhausted. My daughter's been crying and fussing for over an hour since I tried to put her down to sleep, and my son is throwing tantrums left and right. I haven't been able to tend to either kid for two minutes without the other one screaming and needing me. I tell my husband to deal with our son so I can finally get the baby to sleep. 9:15 p.m. \u2014 Both kids are finally asleep. I'm dead. I hop in the shower to rinse off the day and it feels so good. 11 p.m. \u2014 After hearing more about my husband's work meetings and catching up on the NBA playoffs, we go to sleep. Daily Total: $85.54", "day_three": "Day Three: 6:15 a.m. \u2014 My son is awake, but I've been awake with the baby four times in the last six hours, so it's my husband's turn to get up with my son. I go back to sleep until the baby wakes me at 7:05 a.m. Advertisement 7:30 a.m. \u2014 Husband made our son a PB&J for breakfast, which he eats with milk. I eat the two bites he leaves uneaten along with my espresso and almond milk. The kids run around while I straighten up around the house a little bit. The baby is fussy so I nurse her, but she doesn't want me to put her down. I've noticed in the past couple of weeks that her separation anxiety is through the roof. It's developmentally normal, so I just try to give her extra loving. 9 a.m. \u2014 My husband takes both kids in the stroller to walk my son to preschool and I get 20 minutes of peace to drink my now-cold coffee and eat a banana. I think about the day ahead. We'll have the leftover chicken stew for lunch and then I'll cook up one of the Sun Basket meals for dinner. I have to find a way to get exercise in today. My husband might be taking the day off today to work on house projects, so maybe after I'm done working and the nanny is gone, he can take the baby so I can work out. 11:45 a.m. \u2014 After working for a few hours, I'm super hungry and need a break. I heat up chicken stew leftovers and add in the last of the buckwheat groats for an extra boost of fiber and protein. I wish I was having a big sloppy burrito instead. 4:05 p.m. \u2014 Done working. Husband and I decide to go to Costco with the baby to check out their fruit tree and flower selection. Guess I'm not exercising today. We don't end up liking any of the plants, but we pick up a couple of organic whole chickens, eggs, applesauce, and beer ($60.28) along with summer clothes for the kids, a summer hat for me, and non-toxic bug repellent for the family ($79.93).  $140.21 Advertisement 5:30 p.m. \u2014 Pick up our son on our way home. Usually we all eat together, but my husband suggests we let our son eat now and have adult dinner when the kids are asleep. I heat up the last of the chicken stew for my son and the baby, and then my son has applesauce afterward. After they eat, we play with the kids and I chat on the phone with my mom for a bit. 7:30 p.m. \u2014 Kid sleep time is a cluster**** per usual, and I'm so glad my husband is home to help. 8:45 p.m. \u2014 The kids are finally asleep. I make dinner from our Sun Basket (chiles rellenos with sirloin steak strips, onions, pinto beans, and romesco) and we eat, partially collapsed, on the couch. We drink blonde ales that we got at Costco and try to turn on the latest episode of  Atlanta , but the FXNOW app is literally the worst and it won't play. We eventually get it working and watch the episode about Al/Paper Boi and his Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day (no spoilers). Great episode. All the actors on this show are good, but Brian Tyree Henry is a breakout star. 9:30 p.m. \u2014 Aaaaand the baby is awake again. My husband goes in to try to make her fall asleep without me having to nursing her. She screams intermittently for an hour until he gets her asleep again. Meanwhile, I'm feeling a migraine coming on. 11:12 p.m. \u2014 Yup, the migraine is official. My husband and I finally lie down to sleep. Advertisement Daily Total: $140.21", "day_four": "Day Four: 7 a.m. \u2014 Baby had me up three times last night. Husband woke up with our son at 6:15 a.m., and I get up with the baby at 7. My son is in the backyard watching the concrete guys pour cement, and he is absolutely enchanted with the whole process. He thinks it's the coolest thing he's ever seen. I had the idea to have all four of us stamp our handprints in the concrete while it's wet to create a permanent mark of our family in this house, so we're waiting until the cement is juuuuust right before we do it. We give my son oatmeal and milk, and he eats most of it. Baby food for baby girl. 9:30 a.m. \u2014 The nanny is here, and it's just about time to stick our hands in the cement. It goes off without a hitch \u2014 all four of our handprints look good, and we run inside to wash the cement off our hands (because it's caustic). I go back out to scrape in our initials and the year with a nail to seal the deal. Looks awesome! I hope 50 years from now someone lives in this house and looks at the handprints and the \"2018\" imprint and wonders about us. Maybe we should bury a time capsule, too. Is that still a thing? 10 a.m. \u2014 Son is at preschool, and I'm at my desk, eating a couple of eggs on toast. Still have a migraine, so I really don't feel like working, but mama's gotta bring home the bacon. My husband and I quickly go over our house repair priority list. Now that the concrete work is done, we have to budget for the next thing. There's always a next thing, we're discovering. Advertisement 12 p.m. \u2014 Well, I haven't been very productive. Texting with a friend about her baby shower that's in a couple days. We live a few hours away from each other and don't get to hang much, so I'm excited to see her, her family, and her baby bump :). My husband heads to the hardware store and buys what he needs to finish fixing the clogged drain in the front yard.  $42.67 3:30 p.m. \u2014 I have to go to J.C. Penney to pick up an online order of swimsuits for the kids and my hubby for our family vacation to Hawaii next month. The option to pick up from the store was $9 cheaper than getting the order shipped to my house.  $67.75 4 p.m. \u2014 The tank in my car is almost empty, so I stop at Costco to get gas on the way back. I make a mental note that both cars need oil changes as soon as possible.  $32.68 4:15 p.m. \u2014 I also pick up Costco food court goods for dinner ($8.09). Hot dogs and a chicken bake.  $8.09 4:30 p.m. \u2014 While I'm out, the concrete work is finished and my husband writes them a huge check. GULP.  $3,428 6:05 p.m. \u2014 After dinner, we go over to my parents' house to hang out for a bit. We have lemon pie and play with the kids before heading home. 8:45 p.m. \u2014 Both kids are asleep. We've been shopping for outdoor furniture for our backyard for months, and we finally settle on the patio set we want. I order it online.  $808.17 Advertisement 10:45 p.m. \u2014 Baby is awake again, so husband goes to try to get her to fall asleep. 11:45 p.m. \u2014 It's not working. The crying is eating away at my soul. I give in and go nurse her. This baby is never, ever going to sleep through the night, and I'm never, ever going to sleep longer than two hours in a row again. Daily Total: $4,387.36", "day_five": "Day Five: 7:30 a.m. \u2014 Up with the baby two more times last night. My husband got up with the kids and let me sleep in. Love that guy. Coffee for me, and PB&J sandwiches for hubs and son. 8:45 a.m. \u2014 Husband walks with the kiddos to take my son to school, and I organize my to-do list for the day. Other than work, I need to get my friend's baby shower gift wrapped before tomorrow, so I look in the garage cabinets to see if we have any non-Christmas gift wrapping paper. I also need to do a load or two of laundry so that the baby and I will have something cute to wear. 11 a.m. \u2014 Take a quick break from work to cook up egg whites, which I eat with a couple slices of deli turkey breast in a wrap. Back to work. 4 p.m. \u2014 Just finished working, so I crack open a beer. My husband is taking one of the cars for an oil change, and he takes the baby with him to see if she'll nap in the car. We get free scheduled maintenance for the first couple of years since it's a Toyota, so it doesn't cost us anything. I wrap my friend's gift and start on dinner from Sun Basket. It's braised chicken with artichokes and sun-dried tomatoes, which I'm serving with rice I cooked a couple days ago. I finish my beer and feel relaxed. Advertisement 6:05 p.m. \u2014 After dinner, we head over to my parents' house to play and hang out for an hour until it's bedtime for the kiddos. My mom cuts up some strawberries for everyone. 9 p.m. \u2014 Both kids are finally asleep. We're wiped. Husband and I collapse on the couch, catch up on the day, and then watch an episode of  Homes by the Sea , a British home tour show. I officially want to move to Cornwall. 11 p.m. \u2014 Every night we say we're going to sleep earlier than 11 p.m., but our night owl tendencies are hard to defeat. Sleep time. Daily Total: $0", "day_six": "Day Six: 7:15 a.m. \u2014 Up and at 'em. My husband plays with the kids while I shower and finally wrap my friend's baby shower present. I gather up everything I need for the baby, since we'll be gone for several hours. Sweet husband makes us all breakfast. Egg and turkey bacon burritos. Yum. Finish getting myself and my daughter ready. 9:30 a.m. \u2014 Baby and I are on the road. The baby shower is a couple hours' drive away. I'm praying she naps part of the way, since it's her nap time anyway. 10:30 a.m. \u2014 Hahahahahahaha. She's been screaming for an hour nonstop, and I've already pulled off the freeway twice to soothe her. 11:30 a.m. \u2014 Hahahahahahahaha. She's been screaming for  two  hours nonstop, and I've pulled off the freeway  four  times to soothe her. 2:30 p.m. \u2014 That was a beautiful baby shower. So good to catch up with my friend and her family and celebrate her sweet baby who's coming so soon. I check in with my husband and he says he took our son to get free hamburgers and play in a bounce house at a local shop in town that was hosting a grand opening party. Time to get back on the road. Advertisement 4:40 p.m. \u2014 Yay, the baby napped for an hour and then was content the rest of the way back. On the drive, I get a phone call from another friend who is also pregnant and whose baby shower I offered to throw. We chat for 40 minutes. 6 p.m. \u2014 I pan-fry some salmon with saut\u00e9ed kale, shallots, celery, and chickpeas. We throw it into tortillas and call it salmon veggie wraps. Pretty good. 8:40 p.m. \u2014 Kids are finally asleep. We kick up our feet with beers and watch an episode of  Grand Designs , a different British home tour show. 11 p.m. \u2014 Hi again, 11 p.m. Sleep time. Daily Total: $0", "day_seven": "Day Seven: 7:20 a.m. \u2014 Was up with the baby three times last night. My husband is letting me sleep in and taking the kids somewhere. Back to sleep. 9 a.m. \u2014 Awake. That was glorious. Head into the kitchen to grab coffee. We decide to head over to my parents' house to hang out. I put on my running shoes and tell my husband I'll meet him there. I jog there and stretch. 10:15 a.m. \u2014 Time to watch Game 7 of the Cavs-Pacers series. My mom loves Lebron so much. I decide to root for the Cavs, even though I'm not a Lebron fan myself. Plus, my mom threatens that none of us can come over to her house ever again if we root against Lebron. LOL, my mom is so extra. 12:30 p.m. \u2014 My mom cooked us tri-tip, pilaf, and salad. We all eat and decide to put our son to sleep for nap time so we can keep hanging out. Advertisement 1:10 p.m. \u2014 Lebron wins, so my mom is happy and we're allowed to come over in the future. And I'm happy she's happy. 4:30 p.m. \u2014 My son has outgrown his shoes and needs warm weather PJs, so we head out to find some. We scour Marshalls, Ross, and Target, and get shoes and PJs for him, a new summer dress for me, and flip-flops for my husband.  $108.96 4:45 p.m. \u2014 I also order several packs of diapers for my daughter while they're on sale.  $80.14 5:30 p.m. \u2014 We're home, and I let my son have a PB&J for dinner. Hubs and I are still full from lunch, so we don't eat anything. 9 p.m. \u2014 Both kids are asleep. Bedtime routine was a mess as usual. With rum and Cokes in hand, we watch two episodes of  Grand Designs  and laugh about the weekend's antics. 10:45 p.m. \u2014 Sleep time. 11:23 p.m. \u2014 Just kidding. Baby was up and crying.

My BF stayed over last night and doesn't have to work today, so he offers to take care of the wolves while I sleep in. I start work at 7 a.m. and get off at 3:30 p.m. everyday, so it's super nice to get an extra 30 minutes of sleep. My work is super casual, so I just throw on a hoodie and jeans, brush my teeth, and wash my face. Then I grab eggs for breakfast and a leftover turkey burrito bowl and head out the door. 7 a.m. \u2014 My office is a five-minute drive from my house, but when it's nice out I choose to ride my bike. It's raining today, unfortunately, so I drive. I check my email and then go to the office kitchen to scramble up two eggs (my go-to breakfast). 8 a.m. \u2014 So I totally forgot that our office breakfast program starts today! I'm getting a second breakfast I guess. For $2.50 a meal, a local chef comes in three times a week and makes us food from sustainable ingredients. Today is a poached egg on a bed of pea shoots, a baked potato, and a radish tart with apple and leek vinaigrette salad. It's delicious and super filling on top of the two eggs I ate earlier. (I pay monthly for the breakfasts.) 12:30 p.m. \u2014 It's sunny now, so I go outside for a walk. I walk down to the sea wall and grab a ginger-flavored Rise kombucha from the local grocery store. My favorite! I get an hour break every day, so I walk pretty far along the sea wall and feel super refreshed when I get back to my desk.  $5 Advertisement 3:30 p.m. \u2014 Off work. I get home and am greeted by my happy fat little wolves. My BF is still here, surprisingly, as he's usually out when it's nice. He's a pro-athlete, so his schedule is very flexible. He goes on two week-long filming trips at least once a month, so the dogs are very happy when he's around and so am I. His main source of income is from his sponsors and odd jobs he picks up from his friends. We decide to go for a bike ride to the beach before the rain hits us again. 6 p.m. \u2014 When we get back, we feed the dogs and take them out to pee. We're super hungry, so we decide to order a pizza: thin crust with cream sauce, arugula, mushrooms, and red onions. I pop open a bottle of red and have a glass while my BF has a beer from the fridge. We settle in for the night, rewatching  Shameless .  $25 9:30 p.m. \u2014 Because I wake up so early everyday, I have a weeknight bedtime of 10 p.m. I brush my teeth, change into sweats, and do my nightly beauty routine: Amorepacific Enzyme Peel, Eve Lom Cleanser, The Ordinary Lactic Acid and Hyaluronic Acid, and GlamGlow Dreamduo Overnight Treatment.

You know those memes that are like: \"Me at work vs. Me on the weekend?\" I am that girl. I look like shit during the week and then turn up on the weekends. I'm constantly told I look different outside of work. Who am I trying to impress in front of my computer? NOBODY. Pair up my track pants with my Timbs and my Alpha bomber jacket, and I'm out the door feelin' great. Advertisement 12:30 p.m. \u2014 Meetings all morning. I swear our meeting room is nap-inducing. Spent the entire meeting trying to keep my eyes open and thinking: \"This all could have just been sent in an email.\" I've been with this company for seven years now, and I'm really good at my job, but I'm getting super bored of it. I actually went on a few interviews a few months ago and got an offer from a company I was really excited about, but when I went to quit my job...my company basically said no and that they'd give me whatever the other company was offering and change my job title if I stayed. I stayed. I can't really complain, because I'm so comfortable here and I love everyone I work with. But the challenge just isn't there. 3:30 p.m. \u2014 Off work! It's raining, so it's going to be a lazy night I'm sure. My BF has a bunch of friends over when I get home, and the dogs are right in the middle of it just loving all the attention. There are constantly guys over, which I don't mind at all. They're all so nice and I'm kinda like their mom. I ask if they've been eating their veggies or if they just live off beer. They're watching skate videos, so I go into my room to watch  Gossip Girl  and relax. 6:30 p.m. \u2014 The boys are hungry, so we venture over to a local pub a few blocks away. The BF and I share nachos and I get a cider. He pays. He pays anytime we go out, which evens out because he stays with me at my condo whenever he's in town. I know people might assume that he's a freeloader or whatever, but he has never taken advantage of me and is so grateful. Also, it's cool because if I ever need anything handy done, I have like 10 dudes I can hit up to come fix things. We're just one big family.

This is actually pretty normal around here...the dogs' beds are actually so comfy and each fits a full-sized adult (because the dogs are both 90 pounds). The maximum number of people I've had crashing at my place was 10 guys from the States when they came up to Canada for a trip. And oddly, even though I only have one bathroom, it actually wasn't that bad.

It's so nice today! We laugh, gossip, and drink until the sun goes down. 6:30 p.m. \u2014 My BF comes to meet us at the park and says he's hungry, so the group of us bike to my favorite vegan place, Meet in Gastown.

She pays for us both because I drove. 8 p.m. \u2014 I'm home and the BF is watching  Prison Break  with the dogs. He's already walked and fed them, so I relax with him and tell him about my mountain time. I've been snowboarding since I was five years old, so it's a huge part of my life.

We all laugh and cry and then drink some more. The bride is one of my best friends, and she loves The Eagles and really wants to see them live, so I decide to buy us tickets to their show as part of my gift to her. My BF and I already gave the couple cash for their wedding gift, but I want to do a little extra for her. I confirm that she hasn't bought her own tickets yet and buy two resale tickets for us on my phone. She is going to die from happiness.

Today's the Boston Marathon! I check my phone and see a text from my friend, L., asking if I want to get brunch. Sounds great, but I turn her down since I have food that needs to get eaten before it goes bad. We make plans to still meet up and watch the marathon \u2014 L. and I live two minutes from each other, which makes impromptu plans sooo easy. I eat blueberries and Greek yogurt while chatting with my roommate, K., who's working from home. I make coffee to bring with me to the marathon, and add some hot chocolate mix and Kahlua to it for extra excitement. 1 p.m. \u2014 After cheering on the impressive runners for an hour, we can't feel our toes, so L. and I walk/jog back home, feeling inspired! I eat a hardboiled egg, baby carrots, celery with peanut butter, and two crumpets with butter and Trader Joe's Everything But the Bagel Seasoning. (This seasoning is one of my proudest TJ's discoveries and I love sharing it with anyone who appreciates everything bagels.) 5 p.m. \u2014 I am feeling MEH. It seems to be a combination of antsy and apathetic. I'm thinking it's related to a dude situation: I had been amped for a recent date, but it didn't go quite as I had daydreamed. We still had a good time and got brunch in the morning, but for some reason, I didn't feel as *swoon-y* as I did after our first few dates. I try to take care of beginning of week activities to feel productive and positive\u2026but it's not working. I realize I have a decent amount going on this week and may not make it to any of my favorite workout classes. I text my friend S. about going shopping tomorrow to find dresses for a school social event coming up this weekend. Then I get wishy-washy and wonder if I should go to yoga instead.

I easily find street parking, which makes me happy ($1.50).  $1.50 10 a.m. \u2014 Afterwards, I treat myself to coffee ($5.30) because I'm proud of how reasonable I've become about blood work. Two years ago it freaked me out so much, and now I trust that the technicians clearly know what they're doing. Plenty of people get their blood drawn every day and survive.  $5.30 10:30 a.m. \u2014 Can't find parking for a while at work, but remind myself to chill because my boss is quite understanding of people needing to attend to personal things like doctor's appointments. I'll get to work soon enough and take care of what needs to get done. 12:30 p.m. \u2014 I finish some QA testing that I've been working on with developers for more than a month. It's exciting to finally wrap it up! I get a seltzer and a bag of Chex Mix from the free office snack collection to celebrate, and then move on to the next project. 2:30 p.m. \u2014 For lunch, I heat up an Annie's Broccoli & Cheddar Bake Bowl that I put in the work freezer last week. I'm still feeling meh and in such a funk, with little energy to be productive. I'm not sure what's going, but I try to sing \u201cJust one of them days, don't take it personal\u201d in my head to remind myself that this happens once in a while and it'll be temporary.

As we're about to leave, I find an amazing Free People skirt and a fun jacket on ridiculous sale, so I buy them both. I might return the jacket, though, because it's metallic and gives off a bit of an intergalactic vibe.  $38.89 10 p.m. \u2014 I'm home, and so glad we saw each other.

I feel so much better after seeing her. 10:30 p.m. \u2014 I go online to see if I can find the amazing Free People skirt in another size/color. The one I bought is blue and a bit big. I know it comes in a beautiful pink \u2014 but the store didn't have it in my size. I find the skirt online (still on sale, but not as inexpensive) and buy it in two sizes since I'm not sure what my size is, along with a pair of pants to get free shipping.

I check out a consignment store and TJMaxx, but don't find anything I like. I'm hungry, so I stop by Whole Foods and get an everything bagel, Fiji tuna salad, and a container of sprouts (because I recently saw a picture of a veggie sandwich on Pinterest with sprouts and it looked nice). Interesting combination of flavors, but it turns out pretty good and I'm really full!  $7.05 5:30 p.m. \u2014 After working on ongoing projects, it's time for the work day to be over, and I head to therapy! I started with this therapist about two months ago and found out last week that she's being relocated, which is a bummer, because I've really enjoyed her therapeutic style.

I eat a few blackberries and throw sad carrots and a wrinkly red pepper in my bag and drive to work. 9:10 a.m. \u2014 I check emails while drinking coffee and eating the usual crunchy granola bar. Notice a few texts from someone I went on a couple of dates with last month; I'd thought things were done! Hmmm... 11 a.m. \u2014 I have a bit of a stressful morning meeting. I need to come up with crafty, more automated solutions for a colleague to lessen her workload. I have a seltzer and bag of Chex Mix (courtesy of my office kitchen) after the meeting to get energized to work on the project. 12 p.m. \u2014 I find out that we're ordering lunch in! This happens at least every other week, and I'm always grateful when it does. I get a Greek salad with tuna. I usually try not to eat too much tuna, but I'm a pescatarian, so my lunch options with protein from the places we mostly order from are limited . I really enjoy eating lunch with a few of my coworkers \u2014 on some days, work drags me down, but on other days, like today, I laugh so hard that my stomach hurts.

I would not be able to afford school right now if it weren't for this benefit. Whenever I hear people questioning how to finance their higher education, I suggest that they check out whether they can work at the school. The degree I'm working on now would cost $120,000 in credits. The part-time route is taking me longer than it would an average student, but the time sacrifice feels very much worth it to me. 6:30 p.m. \u2014 After class, I swing by AutoZone to buy gas-line antifreeze ($4.24). I talked to my dad the other night about proactive care for my car, and he recommended this (and a few other things) since I drive short distances regularly. I fill up my tank at a gas station down the street ($33.65). I really don't have as intense as of need for my car as I did with my work/school/internship schedule last year, but I still drive almost every day for work and errands. Even though I live in a city with decent public transportation, I really cherish the freedom and alone time that I get from having a car.  $37.89 Advertisement 7 p.m. \u2014 I go to Trader Joe's and buy bread, yogurt, goat cheese, masala simmer sauce, figs, frozen naan, carrots, cucumbers, broccoli, blackberries, an onion, and Dark Chocolate Orange Sticks.  $30.88 7:45 p.m. \u2014 When I get home, I'm not super hungry, but I have a feeling I won't want a full dinner later, so I blend frozen bananas and almond butter to make a bowl of imitation ice cream to eat. I cook a bunch of lentils and wild rice and add masala simmer sauce, which I then divide into leftover containers. Woohoo \u2014 lunches and dinners for the next few days! My rice usually turns out super mushy, but I found a tip online to cook it more like pasta, with excess water that you drain once the texture is right, and it turns out great. 8:30 p.m. \u2014 I Venmo my dad because I asked him to pick up flowers from me for his wife's birthday yesterday. Seemed like a better idea than ordering flowers online to be delivered (they live in Texas). He was happy to help and she loved them!  $20 9 p.m. \u2014 Check in on work emails and Craigslist. I'm trying to find a new place to live for this coming September. My roommate got into business school in California, so she's moving there at the end of the summer. I'm hoping to find a perfect spot that's convenient for the different directions I'll be going in next year (for work and school) with fun roommates.

These meetings are pretty much a waste of my time, but we get catered breakfast, which makes it worth it. I make myself half of an everything bagel with peanut butter and an espresso. I prefer coffee, but my office doesn't have a drip coffee maker. 1 p.m. \u2014 I'm dying to take a little lunchtime walk, but I'm too busy to leave my desk. 3 p.m. \u2014 I didn't pack my lunch today, but I'm not super hungry and I don't have a lot of time, so I get an iced coffee from a nearby caf\u00e9.  $3.21 5 p.m.. \u2014 My office kitchen stocks tons of snacks, so I grab a bag of popcorn and try to get a difficult code enigma figured out. 6 p.m. \u2014 I take the subway to my therapy appointment. I have time to spare, so I stop by a boutique and pick up a pretty black blouse and bralette ($41). I also stop by the ATM to take out a month's worth of therapy co-pays. I'm not insured through my workplace, but through some weird exception, my work funded a $750 HSA account for me. I withdraw the money from that account ($160).  $41 8 p.m. \u2014 I leave my therapist's office and go to Whole Foods. This is a weekly ritual for me. I love grocery shopping \u2014 it feels like an extension of my therapy session. I get a green bell pepper, Persian cucumbers, grape tomatoes, a yellow onion, chickpeas, black beans, tempeh, vegan chick'n nuggets, a frozen burrito, and almond milk.  $28 Advertisement 9:30 p.m. \u2014 I shower, change into comfy clothes, and start cooking up some cauliflower kimchi fried rice and a chopped vegetable side salad. I was planning on packing the leftovers for lunch tomorrow, but end up eating everything. I go back into the kitchen to cook another serving for tomorrow. 11 p.m. \u2014 I get into bed with my book and fall asleep soon after.

I go through my routine and then remember that I need to do my makeup because I have a date later tonight. I don't wear makeup every day, but I make an effort if I have social plans after work. I contemplate taking my makeup bag to work and doing it there, but decide to do it now and be a few minutes late instead. 9:10 a.m. \u2014 Not too late to work, fortunately. I make myself an espresso and eat half a bagel with peanut butter from yesterday's leftovers. 1 p.m. \u2014 I eat my desk lunch of kimchi fried cauliflower rice and salad. 3 p.m. \u2014 I'm feeling restless, so I go across the street to get a coffee and a chocolate croissant. I sit by the window and people watch for a little while.  $5.38 6:15 p.m. \u2014 A guy I've been seeing for the past couple months, D., picks me up from my office to take me to dinner. I've felt somewhat ambivalent about this guy since I've met him. We have an amazing emotional connection, but I don't feel intense physical chemistry. I find myself comparing him to my ex a lot, which sucks. We walk to a cute Thai restaurant, where we each get a glass of white wine and share a julienne salad, edamame dip with wonton chips, and spicy vegetable tofu green curry. Everything is delicious. He offers to pay, but I insist that we split.  $23.14 Advertisement 8 p.m. \u2014 We take the subway back to his place. The only dessert he has is a half a cookie left in the freezer, so he puts it on a frying pan to heat it up for me while I shower. 8:30 p.m. \u2014 I spend 15 minutes on the phone with my dad. I haven't talked to him in a couple months. Our conversation feels a little forced, but it's nice to catch up. 9 p.m. \u2014 D. and I cuddle in bed with our books. I'm not a huge fan of watching TV or movies in the evening. I spend my whole day in front of a computer, and a lot of time intermittently on my phone answering texts and emails. It's just too much screen time for me. I try to read my book, but we end up talking for most of the night until we fall asleep.

Not a good combination, but somehow D. finds my bad attitude charming. I borrow a sweater from his closet so I'm not wearing the exact same clothes as yesterday. D. walks me to the train station, and on our way through the park, we stop to admire the feral cats that live there. I love the cats, and love how D. always indulges in this habit with me. Advertisement 9 a.m. \u2014 Arrive at the office and make myself some espresso. 10:30 a.m. \u2014 Feeling peckish, so I eat some pita chips and hummus from the office kitchen. 12:30 p.m. \u2014 I walk to The Strand to pick up a book I've been wanting to read:  My Promised Land  by Ari Shavit. They have a used copy available, so I choose that over a new edition. I also wanted to get  Two Sisters  by \u00c5sne Seierstad, but they don't have it in stock.  $9.25 1 p.m. \u2014 I get Indian food for lunch: a bowl with brown rice, chana masala, and saag paneer, plus a small samosa.  $8 3 p.m. \u2014 I check the Mint app on my phone and see that my tax refund has arrived! $1,490! I tell myself I should treat myself to a designer bag I want, but I know I probably won't. I don't like making big purchases, but I generally let myself indulge in smaller treats throughout the month. 4 p.m. \u2014 I cancel a drinks date I had scheduled tonight. I've been out with this guy, J., twice. He's great on paper, but I'm just not crazy about him. When I met my ex, I was instantly enamored, and I guess I'm waiting for that feeling again. There's a free classical music concert tonight that I want to go to, and I contemplate inviting him, but decide I'd rather go alone. 9:30 p.m. \u2014 The concert was amazing. So nice to close my eyes and focus on the beautiful music. I donate $5 to the nonprofit that organized the event. Via is having a promotion where they're offering rides for $2.95, so I call a car home and tip the driver a couple of extra dollars.  $10 Advertisement 10 p.m. \u2014 I snack on a hard boiled egg, two pieces of toast with goat cheese, and a couple cookies with a glass of almond milk. 11:30 p.m. \u2014 Not sure where the rest of the evening went.

Why does no amount of sleep ever feel like enough? 9:15 a.m. \u2014 Roll into work late. I'm pretty emotionally checked out of this job. I've been here for a year and a half and plan on leaving soon to freelance for the summer. My boss is insufferable. We sit next to each other, and he has literally clipped his nails under his desk while sitting two feet away from me before, among other infractions. I also recently found out that one of my male colleagues makes significantly more than I do, despite doing the same job and having similar qualifications as me. It's left me feeling bitter, and consequently, I've felt no guilt about coming to work late or taking long lunch breaks. I make an espresso and eat an ezekiel bread English muffin with peanut butter that I brought from home. 12:30 p.m. \u2014 I walk to Muji to look for a housewarming gift for a colleague. I peruse for a while but don't find anything. Then I take a walk around the neighborhood and return to my desk to eat the veggie burger and salad I packed for lunch. Advertisement 3 p.m. \u2014 A colleague and I go across the street to get coffee, and the barista tells me it's on the house! 6 p.m. \u2014 On my way out of work, I take out cash from an ATM for my cleaning lady who is coming tomorrow ($60). She cleans for me every other week. It's a pretty unnecessary luxury considering I live in a studio and am generally pretty neat, but cleaning makes me anxious and it's so nice never having to deep clean. I've been thinking about ending our arrangement and cleaning myself, but my cleaning lady is the sweetest, most hardworking woman and I feel terrible taking away one of her income sources. 7 p.m. \u2014 After changing and doing my makeup at home, I meet J. for dinner at a Vietnamese place near me. He was very gracious after I cancelled last minute yesterday, so I go despite not feeling very excited about the date. I have a huge bowl of spicy curry veggies with brown rice. J. pays. 9 p.m. \u2014 We walk over to a nearby bar and spend the evening flirting, playing chess, and drinking. He pays again. 11 p.m. \u2014 J. walks me home and we make out on the street for a while. It was a nice date, but once I'm back in my apartment, all I can think about is my ex. I'm still pretty tipsy, so I put on \"Nothing Compares 2 U\" by Sin\u00e9ad O'Connor on repeat and wonder if my ex is feeling the same way.

I buy it. Next I walk to my optometrist's office to pick up a six-month supply of contact lenses. I payed for it with my HSA last week.  $14.50 5 p.m. \u2014 I leave work and take the train to Times Square to try to get discounted Broadway tickets for myself and a friend. Unfortunately, there are no affordable tickets left for the shows we wanted to see. I call her to break the news, and we decide to meet at an Italian restaurant instead. 8 p.m. \u2014 My friend and I each get a pizza and also split a burrata and beet salad and a bottle of ros\u00e9 prosecco. The food is divine, and I end up a little drunk.  $43.55 10 p.m. \u2014 I take a cab home. While I was at work, my cleaning lady came, and my apartment is spotless.

I sip slowly and walk to Lululemon to exchange a pair of leggings D. got me as a gift. He's a thoughtful gift giver and I really appreciate the gesture, but I hate the print he picked out. I didn't have the heart to tell him that, so I feigned enthusiasm. He left me with a gift receipt, so despite feeling guilty, I exchange them for a more sensible navy blue color. The sales lady somehow convinced me to exchange my $98 pair for an even more expensive pair, so I end up paying the difference ($43). Afterwards, I go to Madewell and pick up a blouse that makes me excited for spring ($44).  $88.25 12 p.m. \u2014 Back at my apartment, I eat an apple with peanut butter while I pack a small weekend bag. I'm going to be dog-sitting for a family member for a couple of days. When I arrive at their place, I see they left me $80! 2 p.m. \u2014 I've had such a lazy afternoon. I still have a bit of a headache, so I've just been dozing on the couch and browsing the Internet. I answer a few emails that I've been meaning to get to and help myself to a bagel I find in the freezer, as well as some Mallomars from the cabinet.

The total is $38, and I know I could have gotten the same thing for half the cost at Whole Foods, but I console myself by telling myself that it's good to support local businesses.  $38 7 p.m. \u2014 After feeding and walking the dog, I grab a bottle of wine from the fridge (I was given permission!) and take the subway to Brooklyn. The journey takes about an hour in total, and I get lost in my book. 11:30 p.m. \u2014 I leave the housewarming party. It was low-key, and I had a great time. My colleague's girlfriend made delicious tofu sliders just for me because she knows I'm a vegetarian, which was such a lovely gesture.

The dog has anxiety issues, so she doesn't come with us. :( Advertisement 2 p.m. \u2014 I feed the dog and take her for a walk. Then I hop on the train to go to my friend's apartment in Queens. The trip takes forever, but I remembered to bring my books, so I get some quality reading time in. I arrive at my friend's apartment just as she's taking lemon poppy cookies out of the oven.

For breakfast, I eat the baked goods that I bought from the bakery yesterday. The day looks sunnier than the weather forecast said it would be, so I throw a load of laundry into the washing machine. It takes so much time to wait for the wash to finish, and then to hang up every piece of clothing outside. You never realize how many socks you have until you're clipping them up one-by-one. 11 a.m. \u2014 J. and I go to the multimedia rental store to rent  Iron Man , which costs $0.73. I pay for half of it ($0.37). We pick up fried chicken from a place down the street. I don't have a whole lot of coins on me, so I give J. a 1,000-yen bill that covers a little more than half ($9.16). We pretend not to notice that a toddler is twerking on the bench across from us. On the way home, I get a milk pudding and J. gets an ice cream sandwich and red bean dessert from 7-Eleven. J. pays for all of it.  $9.53 12 p.m. \u2014 We eat the chicken with rice we made ahead of time and watch  Iron Man . 3 p.m. \u2014 J. heads home and I take a nap.

I set it last night, hoping it would motivate me to go my boxing class. My boyfriend, M., and I went away this past weekend and had a late flight back, so I'm still recovering. I hit snooze and go back to bed. 6:30 a.m. \u2014 Pull myself out of bed and hop in the shower. My morning routine isn't too crazy. I shower, wash my face, put on makeup, and straighten my hair. I am moving slowly this morning, but decide I need to go to the gym, so I pack a bag that will work for yoga, spin, or whatever I decide. I'll check ClassPass later for classes. 7:15 a.m. \u2014 Scramble two eggs with bacon and goat cheese for my breakfast. Pack my lunch (leftovers from last night) and put a few dishes away from the dishwasher. Looking in the fridge, I realize I don't have coconut creamer, so I stop at Starbucks for a coffee on my way to work. 7:30 a.m. \u2014 Get an iced cold brew with coconut milk and sugar-free vanilla and begin my morning commute. It normally takes about 35 to 45 minutes in the morning and, for some reason, an hour on the way home.  $3.45 8:05 a.m. \u2014 Head into work and realize my drink has spilled all over the inside of my work bag! Ugh, my Moleskin that I use for work meetings is completely soaked and so is my calendar book, check book, and laptop. I spend the next few minutes sopping up the mess. Advertisement 8:30 a.m. \u2014 Luckily my laptop turns on \u2014 crisis sort of averted. I eat my breakfast while skimming my work emails and send a quick note to my nutritionist asking to reschedule my appointment for this coming Friday. I also send her my food journal. A few months ago, I was diagnosed with a rare autoimmune condition. As a result, I was put on several medications, including steroids. After a countless number of tests, the doctors still aren't able to figure out what happened. Luckily I am in remission now, but I am taking a lot of preventative measures to ensure I don't have a relapse, like seeing a nutritionist who specializes in folks with autoimmune diseases. I take several prescribed medications as well as a women's probiotic, Vitamin D, Vitamin B12 and a calcium supplement. 9 a.m. \u2014 M. sends me a snap of his new work screensaver, which is a picture of us taken this past weekend on a hike we did in Arizona together. I send him a sassy text back asking who bae is. He just learned what \"bae\" meant \u2014 so I know he will get a kick out of it. We have been together for 10 months and just did our first trip together \u2014 and we still like each other! 9:30 a.m. \u2014 My boss sends me a reminder to book my travel for an upcoming work conference we're heading to in June. I already booked the hotel but need to coordinate the flights. I glance at the flight options and make my selection (Southwest \u2013 gotta get the rewards!) and then make a mental note to tell my mom. She wants to tag along and explore the city while I work. Advertisement 10:45 a.m. \u2014 Reading r\u00e9sum\u00e9s and scheduling interviews has made me hungry. I grab a chocolate chip Rxbar and eat it while posting a new job. 11:40 a.m. \u2014 My boss swings into my office and asks me if I want to grab lunch. I tell him I have an interview in five minutes but will be done at 12:15 p.m. He has a meeting at 1 p.m., though, so we agree to reschedule later this week. 12:30 p.m. \u2014 Heat up my lunch of stuffed bell peppers. My sister and I cooked them last night and they are easily my favorite lunch to bring. I normally stuff them with spicy chicken sausage from Sprouts, add in whatever veggies we have, and put cheese on top. Yummy! I also eat fresh strawberries from my CSA subscription box. They're so sweet they taste like candy! 1:15 p.m. \u2014 My best friend sends a group text with the details and cost breakdown for the upcoming T. Swift concert we're going to. I paid for the tickets months ago, so now I just Venmo her for the hotel.  $33 3 p.m. \u2014 Several fires to put out today, so I'm rescheduling candidates and figuring out the glitches in our processes and offer negotiations. I love my job since no day is ever the same, but everything always seems to hit at once. 4:15 p.m. \u2014 My calendar and Moleskin are still soggy, and my checkbook is definitely a goner. I decide to leave them in my office overnight, hoping they will dry out. I realize I left my gym shoes at home, so I make a detour to my house before my workout. Advertisement 4:20 p.m. \u2014 My sister calls and lets me know that our Blue Apron box hasn't arrived (it was supposed to) and gives me a rundown of items we have in the fridge. I do most of the cooking and grocery shopping and was gone this past weekend, so I was counting on Blue Apron for dinner tonight. Based on the amount of veggies (thank you CSA box) and the protein we have in the freezer, I decide to skip the grocery store. 5:15 p.m. \u2014 Finally home \u2014 the commute was awful. I skim ClassPass to see what options I have and instead decide to sign up for a class tomorrow morning. Since I couldn't bring myself to go to the store and I need coconut creamer for coffee tomorrow, I text M. asking him to bring it, since he's coming over tonight. I skim the fridge and freezer and pull out frozen chicken breasts to defrost. Then I start to unload the dishwasher and realize there's water floating at the bottom. Ugh! Hoping it's a quick fix, I clean the grate, but it doesn't do the trick. I run the disposal thinking it's backed up, and still nothing. Finally, I crawl under the sink with a flashlight and check the water hose line, which also looks clean. I decide to unplug the dishwasher and hope it will reset itself. Voila. Once it's plugged back in, it drains. Thank goodness. I didn't want to call a plumber. 6 p.m. \u2014 With the dishwasher fixed and the chicken defrosting, I decide to do a quick 15-minute yoga video. I like Yoga by Candace and find her videos easy to follow along. My sister wakes up \u2014 she had an early day so she was napping when I got home, and we catch up while watching CNN. Advertisement 6:30 p.m. \u2014 My sister decides to make spaghetti squash (which I don't like), so we both head to the kitchen and she cooks her meal while I work on the chicken. We bought an Instapot a year or so ago and I use it pretty often. The chicken is still a little frozen, but luckily they're cutlets, so they should be fine. I saut\u00e9 the chicken in a mix of herbs and olive oil butter. Once the chicken is saut\u00e9ed on both sides, I adjust the setting to pressure cooker on high for 20 minutes. 7 p.m. \u2014 Chicken is done. I heat up frozen brown rice , which I always have on hand, and leftover roasted veggies from last night. I throw it all together and add ponzu sauce. I love ponzu and am convinced it makes every meal better. While eating, I email Blue Apron and let them know the box was never delivered despite the tracking information confirming it had been. I had never used Blue Apron before but I received a promo code and decided to give it a shot. I am regretting the decision. Oh well! I hope whoever got my box is enjoying it. 7:45 p.m. \u2014 M. arrives with his rescue dog. He had a late day but still managed to pick up the coconut creamer. He picked up two \u2014 one for my house and one for his, since he knows I can't drink coffee black. We both grab a glass of wine and sit down with my sister to watch  Jeopardy! . We are terrible and none of us do well tonight. There was an entire category based on owls?!

Then I wake my sister up to come to the class with me. 5:30 a.m. \u2014 Checked in and I am surprised to see so many chipper people here. I am struggling to keep my eyes open. 6:20 a.m. \u2014 Whew! All done \u2013 I feel like I am going to throw up. We head back home, and I actually do throw up and am now really regretting that wine! While my sister is in the shower, I pack my lunch, eat a blood orange, and assemble my overnight bag, since I am staying at M.'s tonight. I hop in the shower, blow-dry my hair, and throw on my work clothes. 7:20 a.m. \u2014 I make my usual breakfast: two eggs, a piece of bacon, and goat cheese. I have cold brew in the fridge, so I put that in my to-go cup with creamer (obvi) and head out the door with all my bags. 8:10 a.m. \u2014 Sit at my desk, break out my breakfast, have a quick text exchange with M., and start to read through my emails. My boss lets me know he's working from home and thanks me for a bottle of wine I gave him at Christmas, which he just opened last night. I sent him a quick update on offers I have pending, and we agree to do our afternoon meeting via Webex.

I heat up my chicken, leftover brown rice, and roasted veggies. There's a line at the microwave, so I wait a few minutes for my turn, and then eat at my desk. I'm still hungry, so I eat what's left of my strawberries. 12:30 p.m. \u2014 Open my grapefruit La Croix and get back to work. My boss and I are meeting at 1 p.m. to go over the past quarter's results, and he needs an update on a critical role. When I wrote my goals for this year, he thought the metrics I put in were too aggressive, and was worried we wouldn't be able to hit them, but after pulling the data, we are more than on track, so I'm hoping for a big thumbs up! 2:20 p.m. \u2014 The meeting went well! He was very impressed. He asks me to make a few tweaks on my presentation for the leadership team meeting in a few weeks. This will be my first time presenting to the team as a whole, so I am excited. I started here about four months ago, and this is my first opportunity to show them the results of all the work we've been doing. We also talk about my development, and I get put on a larger project that my boss was going to tackle solo. Sweet! Advertisement 3:45 p.m. \u2014 I call Blue Apron, since no one has responded to my email regarding my delivery. Apparently, it was delivered to the wrong address , so they refund my credit and add in an extra week. Based on this experience, I probably won't keep the service \u2014 grocery shopping is much more reliable. 4:20 p.m. \u2014 I am starving and didn't pack any afternoon snacks. I find raw almonds in my office drawer and grab a handful, plus two mini peanut butter cups from the candy bowl in the lobby. Then I hop on Amazon and order a four-pack of Dang Coconut Chips with a 50% off coupon. I choose the no-rush shipping option, so I get $1 in digital credit.  $11.41 5:15 p.m. \u2014 I wrap up the last of my emails and pack up for the day. I send M. a quick text letting him know I'm heading his way. 6:15 p.m. \u2014 Schlep all my bags into M.'s place and we catch up for a minute before we head to sushi. Sushi is always a go-to for me, so I was happy when M. suggested it. We beat the dinner rush and get a table right away. We order two rolls to share, plus M. gets a spicy scallop hand roll, and I get a crispy rice appetizer. We split a large Sapporo. The music is really loud for some reason and we joke that we're in a nightclub since we can't hear each other. The bill comes and M. pays, since he claims its his turn. We try to keep things pretty even, so we take turns paying for dinner/activities. Advertisement 7:30 p.m. \u2014 Full from dinner and exhausted from my workout, I collapse on his couch. M. searches for movies and decides on  The   Royal Tenanbaums , which I begin to fall asleep too. Since he's seen it a million times, he switches it to  Along Came Polly . 9:30 p.m. \u2014 M. wakes me up from my nap time and off to bed we go.

He starts his days much later than I do, so he can take his time moseying around. He makes me a to-go cup of iced coffee, and I head out for the day. M. is a typical bachelor, so the only thing he has in his fridge is a Brita, which he can never remember to fill, and butter. When I stay the night, I can never pack a breakfast or lunch. I stop at Bruegger's, my favorite bagel store, and grab a Skinny Zesty Egg White on an everything bagel.  $5.90 8:15 a.m. \u2014 At my desk, I begin my normal routine of skimming emails, eating breakfast, and taking my meds. I text M. to let him know I made it to work and that it rained on my way in. The weather is so wacky these days. Advertisement 9 a.m. \u2014 I log into my personal email and see that the company refinancing one of my private student loans has fully paid out that account. Yippee! I've been meaning to do this for months but kept putting it off, until my interest rate hit 11.375%, which is insanity. Through refinancing the loan, I dropped my interest rate to 5% and changed the repayment to five years versus seven. This should save me about $4,000 over the life of the loan. I went to a small private college, where I had a scholarship for four years and the rest was covered by loans. I will pay about $40 more a month, which I am happy to do, since a greater portion will go to the principle. 11:15 a.m. \u2014 It's already been a frustrating morning. A scheduling snafu and complications with a high level role have put me in a grumpy mood. I take a break to skim my email, and notice that Sephora is having a promotion on some skincare items. I hop on and find a watermelon sleeping mask I've been wanting, plus an eyelash curler, since mine broke a few weeks ago. I also use the promo code to add in two more trial items: a vitamin C serum by Drunk Elephant (I love their products and have been wanting to try this one) and a hydrating primer by Tatcha. For my three free samples, I pick a perfume, a sunscreen, soand another primer. I normally use these samples when traveling so I don't have to pack as much, or on nights when I stay at M.'s.  $58.19 Advertisement 11:45 a.m. \u2014 I hop out to grab lunch, since I didn't pack anything today. I'd normally venture over to Whole Foods to grab a salad and a juice, but instead venture over to Mendocino Farms, which I haven't tried yet. I decide on a chicken and prosciutto salad. I eat at my desk while reading/editing my presentation for next week.  $14.89 3:50 p.m. \u2014 I snack on the whole wheat tortilla that came with my salad earlier and listen to  Pod Save America  while mentally going through my checklist. I may have to work this weekend so I can really focus on how to launch the programs well. 5:05 p.m. \u2014 My sister texts me and our neighbor to see if we're up for wine later. I'm a bit tired, but a catchup session sounds perfect. I pack up my desk and head out. My aunt calls me on my way home and checks in on me to ask about my health. Since my parents live out of state, she visited and took me to my appointments when I got sick. I let her know things are going well, and we catch up on life. 6:15 p.m. \u2014 At home, I unload all my bags and see I have packages that arrived yesterday. My probiotics from Amazon and an Anthropologie package, which has three shirts I ordered. I love Anthropologie, but I only shop their sale section and keep an eye on key items. I do a quick try-on session and love them all! Perfect! I change quickly, and my sister, her boyfriend, and I head out to meet our neighbor at a winery down the street. Advertisement 6:30 p.m. \u2014 We grab menus from our favorite bartender and grab a table. We order four glasses of wine (reds and a ros\u00e9) and decide on a meat and cheese board and Mediterranean nachos. After catching up for a few minutes outside, we get cold and snag a table inside. We devour the yummy food, and my sister and her boyfriend grab an additional glass of wine. My sister pays for the food. Our wine is free as part of our monthly membership. I grab our two free bottles for the month. 8 p.m. \u2014 Our neighbor, K., and I make our way back home while my sister and her boyfriend head over to grab McDonald's. K. let us know over dinner that she'll be relocating across the country to be with her boyfriend, so these nights will soon become less frequent. I am so happy for her, but will miss having her down the street. 8:30 p.m. \u2014 I steal two chicken nuggets from my sister and head to my room to unwind. I wash my face, brush my teeth, and pull out a Korean sheet mask, since my skin has been feeling a bit dry. I light candles and pull out my book,  The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks.  It's really good. 9:40 p.m. \u2014 I put away my book, blow out my candles, and make a quick call to M., who is out with his dad.

She's heading out of town this afternoon and I'm dog-sitting for her friend, so she gives me the details about pickup/drop-off. Luckily she went grocery shopping, so I have options for breakfast and lunch. I make my normal two eggs, add in buffalo chicken meat she grabbed from the deli, and throw salsa on top. I grab an Amy's frozen burrito and an avocado for lunch. And for snacks, I bring leftover blueberries, hummus, a diced-up orange, and pretzel chips.

My boss sent me an email last night that throws me for a loop. He and I work well together, but I can tell we're going to disagree on this front. I take my meds and look at my agenda for the day. I have phone calls all morning and meetings until the early afternoon. 10:30 a.m. \u2014 Quick text exchange with M. We're going to dinner with his dad tonight and it's my first time meeting him, so I'm a bit nervous. I munch on my blood oranges and chat with one of my colleagues who is also not feeling well.

My boss knows I'm not feeling well, so he tells me to leave when I want.

I call my boss to let him know I'm heading home and will be online in 30 minutes. I hate working from home, so he knows if I'm heading home it means I'm not feeling my best. 3 p.m. \u2014 Home, and I'm greeted by the sweetest little guy I'm dog sitting.

He's pretty easygoing, and M. has told him a lot about me, so the conversation flows easily. We all order steaks, salads, and drinks. M.'s dad pays.

M. orders a round of drinks and we play a game of \u201cCutthroat.\u201d I don't play pool usually, but I join in. To everyone's surprise, including my own, I win the first game.

M. talks me into watching  Dexter , so we watch the first episode, but I'm not convinced this will be something I watch often. 10 p.m. \u2014 It's late and we're both tired, so M. leaves and I get in bed. Daily Total: $54.97", "day_six": "Day Six: 6:45 a.m. \u2014 Ugh \u2014 why am I up? My throat hurts. I guess I didn't fight the cold off. The dog is anxious to get up, so I let him outside on my back patio and doze back to sleep for another 45 minutes. 7:30 a.m. \u2014 I guzzle water and throw on a jacket over my pajamas to take the dog to the park. Since it's early, there are only a few dogs around, which I prefer because it's easier to keep my eye out on the little guy. We stay for about 15 minutes and then make our way back to my house. 8 a.m. \u2014 I want so desperately to go back to bed, but I need to go the market while it isn't too busy. As predicted, there are only a few cars in the lot, so I know it won't take me forever. I'm hosting a friend dinner later this week, so I need all the fixings for pollo asado tacos. I don't really plan ahead for meals, but rather look to see what's in season and go from there. I grab butternut squash, kidney beans, ground turkey, berries, Japanese eggplant, tofu, shrimp, chicken sausage, eggs, bacon, tortilla, hummus, kombucha (they were buy one get one free), smart bagels, and zucchini for zoodles.  $154.32 8:45 a.m. \u2014 Clean out the fridge for any items that have spoiled over the week. I hate wasting food, so this always make me a bit sad, but we are generally pretty good at eating through leftovers. I put everything away, start the dishwasher, and make myself an everything bagel with avocado, cream cheese, and tomatoes for breakfast. Two of my friends text me asking if I'm free, but I don't feel great and I need a day to decompress. A year ago, I said yes to everything, and as a result, I overextended myself professionally and personally, so I am really focusing on making time for myself and being able to say no. So instead of a year of yes, I am calling this a year of no. I know it sounds awful, but it's important for me to focus on my health, both physical and emotional. 11 a.m. \u2014 Hop in the shower, throw my hair up, and head out the door to head to work. I need to get some items done and my VPN isn't working, so I have to go into the office for a bit. I won't be there for longer than an hour \u2014 or that's what I tell myself. 1:30 p.m. \u2014 I get through some of the items I needed to get done so I feel better about Monday. My boss and I have a few more email exchanges before I decide it's time to call it quits. I head home and stop to grab gas since I know I'll need to fill up this week.  $42.87 1:30 p.m. \u2014 Run into CVS to grab my prescription ($40), facial rounds, and razors. My car is filthy and needs a good vacuuming. There's a do-it-yourself car wash by my house, so off I go to vacuum and wash it off ($10).  $74.93 3 p.m. \u2014 I throw in a load of laundry, take the dog out for fresh air, and start on lunches/dinners for the week. I'm making a butternut squash turkey chili. It's technically more of a winter food, but it holds up really well and is super easy to cook. I dice up red and yellow onion, throw it in the Instapot with olive oil, and let it saut\u00e9 for a few minutes before adding in the ground sweet Italian turkey to brown. Then I add canned tomatoes, tomato sauce, kidney beans, squash, and my chili mix (chili powder, garlic salt, red pepper flakes, paprika, salt, and pepper). I set the timer for 40 minutes on the chili setting and let it cook. The Instapot makes everything easier; it's the best kitchen investment I've ever made. 4 p.m. \u2014 I serve myself a bowl of chili with diced up avocado and grated cheese. Yummy. Then I veg out watching Bravo. 5:30 p.m. \u2014 The dog's momma arrives with my sister to pick up the lil guy. She gives me a $50 Starbucks gift card for watching him, which is way too generous. I would watch him for free! They say their goodbyes and I spend a few minutes catching up with my sis. I'm still not feeling super great, so I intend on taking it easy the rest of the night, which I do. I paint my nails, do a face mask, light candles, and read. 9 p.m. \u2014 M. calls to say goodnight and check in about how I'm feeling. After we chat for a few minutes, I fall asleep. Daily Total: $272.12", "day_seven": "Day Seven: 6 a.m. \u2014 My alarm goes off and I hit snooze before getting up and taking a shower. I wash my face, do my makeup, and put my hair in a ponytail because it's Monday and I can't be bothered to do anything more. 7:20 a.m. \u2014 Pack leftover chili, snacks, coffee, and breakfast, and head to work. 8:10 a.m. \u2014 Eat at a bagel with avocado, cream cheese, and tomatoes at my desk while skimming emails. It's Monday, which means new hires and a busy morning. 9:45 a.m. \u2014 Back at my desk from a busy morning and my colleague has left a bowl of Starbursts for me. I love chewy candy like any five-year-old does. I laugh and send him a quick thank you email. 10:30 a.m. \u2014 Our team coordinator swings by to drop off the final version of a project I gave him last week, and it looks awesome. I make a note to tell my boss so he can give him props later this week! I am a big fan of giving people recognition when they go above and beyond. 12:05 p.m. \u2014 Heat up my chili and add the leftover avocado in it from this morning. Eat at my desk while checking my personal email. I get an email from my tax accountant letting me know that my parent's taxes are ready. I also send a quick note to my friends regarding our get-together this week \u2014 it's a monthly girls dinner party we just started, and I'm hosting the first one. 2:45 p.m. \u2014 Snack on pretzel chips while meeting with my boss to go over last week's projects. We have a tight timeline to get things done, so we dive into the data and come up with a game plan to meet the deadline. It's going to be a busy week! 4:45 p.m. \u2014 I need to leave to grab my parents tax documents and head to get my CSA box. I'm hoping for strawberries or berries. Fingers crossed! I'll have to work later tonight, but I would prefer to do that from my couch in my PJs. 6 p.m. \u2014 I bring in my CSA haul (cauliflower, lot of oranges, celery, avocado, asparagus, and spinach), the tax documents, and grab the mail. My Sephora shipment arrived \u2013 yippee! Time to start dinner, so I grab the Japanese eggplant, firm tofu, onion, canned baby corn, and water chestnuts. I dice the eggplant and onion and cook it in sesame oil for a few minutes before throwing in cubed tofu and veggies. Then I add a teriyaki stir-fry sauce, hoisin sauce, and a garlic chili paste. I let it all my simmer for about 15 minutes. I heat up both brown rice (for me) and cauliflower rice (for my sister) and pour it all over the rice. Delicious! We sit down and watch  Last Week Tonight with John Oliver  before switching it to  Jeopardy! . 8 p.m. \u2014 I need to catch up on my work, so I head to my room, throw on trashy reality TV for background noise, and hop online. M. texts me shortly after, asking if he can swing by on his way home. I finish my work before he gets there, and we spend time catching up while I force him to watch terrible reality TV. 10 p.m. \u2014 M. leaves. I wash my face, apply my new night lotion, and set my alarm for 6 a.m. Fingers crossed I don't hit snooze.

We had a mutual friend crash at our place for the weekend, and it's been great fun, but also exhausting! I'm ready to have my couch back. I take too long showering and can tell I'm going to be late for work. Luckily, my hours are somewhat flexible. Before leaving the house, I spritz my face with rosewater and then apply a Vitamin C and hyaluronic acid serum I recently picked up at TJ Maxx, followed by Dr. Jart+ Water Drop moisturizer. My go-to work makeup look is black-brown mascara, Glossier Cloud Paint in the \"Beam\" shade, and Burt's Bees lip balm or Lipstick Queen Frog Prince. 8:20 a.m. \u2014 Arrive at work and prep for our Monday morning team meeting. It's unusually cold for this time of year, and the fact that the air conditioning is on full blast in the office is really bumming me out. I'm still freezing when the meeting is over, so I make a quick trip to the hospital caf\u00e9 for a cup of turmeric tea.  $2.05 12:15 p.m. \u2014 It's been a long and stressful morning, and I am so ready for my lunch break! I'm very lucky to have my parents live close to my work, so I often take advantage of the opportunity for a free meal at their place during my lunch break. I eat a fresh cinnamon roll and a bowl of raspberries before heading back to work. Advertisement 1:45 p.m. \u2014 I have to head to a meeting downtown, so I grab an Uber. I could technically expense it, but for some reason that makes me feel guilty, so I probably won't.  $10.50 4:15 p.m. \u2014 Finally out of the meeting! It ran long, but it was very productive, and it was nice to spend time with colleagues who I usually only speak to over email. If I went back to the office now, it would already be the end of the day by the time I got back, so I decide to run an errand since I'm already downtown. On my way to the shopping center, I stop at Starbucks for a tall matcha soy latte and dark chocolate peanut butter cups, which I pay for using my parents' gold card via the Starbucks app. They don't mind, since they get to use the rewards points! 4:45 p.m. \u2014 Pop into Anthropologie to get a diffuser for the office. Unfortunately for my wallet, there's an extra 25% off sale promotion going on, so I grab a second diffuser from the sale section for my living room, and also pick up a bottle of black tea perfume that I intend to use as a linen spray. (What can I say? Anthropologie is my weakness!) While I'm in the store, I drop my favorite sunglasses and one of the lenses pops out. My boyfriend says he'll try to fix them for me, so I hold off on buying a replacement pair.  $81.22 Advertisement 5:25 p.m. \u2014 I take an Uber home from downtown. It's rush hour, so we get stuck in traffic. Ugh. When I get home, I relax on the couch while finishing up work emails. My cat comes and snuggles up beside me, which makes the fact that I had to bring work home with me way less awful.  $17.75 7 p.m. \u2014 I \"make\" dinner for my boyfriend and me: leftover fried chicken from this weekend with prepared mashed potatoes we bought at the grocery store last week. I had planned to make worms and dirt for dessert as a special treat, but by the time I'm done heating the chocolate pudding, I don't have the energy to add the extra decorations. After dinner, I read a novel while my boyfriend catches up on his favorite TV show. 11:45 p.m. \u2014 Bedtime! I do a minimal nightly skin care routine: cleanse my face with Yes to Cotton face wipes, moisturize, and apply lip balm. Normally, I would read in bed for a while, but tonight it's lights off by midnight because I'm exhausted. Daily Total: $111.52", "day_two": "Day Two: 7 a.m. \u2014 My alarm goes off, but I feel terrible. I cuddle with my kitty for a few minutes before getting up to put the kettle on. Hopefully some tea will turn this day around. I do my usual pre-work skincare and makeup routine and get dressed for work. 8 a.m. \u2014 Once I arrive at work, I head to the mailroom to drop off my Le Tote return. (I had attempted to leave it out for our mailman yesterday, but it never got picked up. That's New Orleans for you!) I'm still feeling a little nauseated, so I run to the cafeteria for toast before heading back to the office. I get a 20% employee cafeteria discount.  $1.04 Advertisement 12 p.m. \u2014 Another long morning! I I have a patient visit and after that, the team has an initial phone interview with a potential new employee. The meeting goes well enough, but by the time we finish debriefing afterwards, I am STARVING. I head over to my parents' house (did I mention I'm a shameless freeloader?) where I make myself a cheese plate with crackers and grapes. 5 p.m. \u2014 After spending the afternoon doing a patient visit and good old-fashioned data entry, I get out of work 30 minutes behind schedule. I walk to a nearby neighborhood to meet with potential new roommates for when my boyfriend moves home after graduation, and make it home in time for  Jeopardy!  (my #1 guilty pleasure). I spend the rest of the evening reading and snacking on Thin Mints while I wait for my boyfriend to get home so we can eat dinner together. 8 p.m. \u2014 My boyfriend gets out of class for the day and we decide on pasta for dinner. I put the water on the stove while he hops in the shower. While I wait, I customize my next Le Tote shipment. After dinner, I clean up and we watch reruns of  Friends . I fall asleep on the couch, so he sends me to bed around 11 p.m. Daily Total: $1.04", "day_three": "Day Three: 7 a.m. \u2014 I turn off my alarm and hop in the shower. This time, I'm running on schedule, and am on my way to work by 7:45. It's a bright morning, but luckily my boyfriend was able to fix my sunglasses! I keep my fingers crossed that they don't fall apart again as soon as I put them in my purse. Once I get to work, I get settled in for the morning while fighting the temptation to go to the caf\u00e9 for a snack. Advertisement 12 p.m. \u2014 I'm super hungry, but all of my coworkers are busy with patients. I can't leave the phones unattended, so I have to wait for at least one of them to get back before I can go to lunch. I catch up on emails for the next 20 minutes or so and then head over to my parents' house. It's a beautiful spring day today and my office has no windows, so I relish the opportunity to be outside. The sunshine has me dreaming of brunch, so I have French toast drizzled with maple syrup and topped with raspberries for good measure. I wash it all down with OJ before heading back to work. 12:45 p.m. \u2014 I've got a serious case of the post-lunch yawns and can't focus on work, so I take a brain break and walk over to the water cooler to refill my S'well bottle. Then I read  New York Times  articles on my phone using my boyfriend's login. (His grad school offers free online subscriptions to students.) 4:30 p.m. \u2014 Finish up a couple of emails and I'm outta here! I head to the local Starbucks for a venti pineapple black tea and a peanut butter cup cookie with my parents' card. Just as I'm about to leave, my parents arrive with their pup in tow! We hang out together on the patio for a while, and since my boyfriend has another late class today, I decide to go over to their house for dinner. I chill on the couch and read a novel that I left there for emergency entertainment purposes. My parents don't feel like cooking, so my mom goes out to get chicken fingers. (We class it up by eating in the dining room as a family.) After dinner, I head back to my apartment. The fast food isn't sitting too well, so I end up going to bed early and am asleep by 10 p.m. Advertisement Daily Total: $0", "day_four": "Day Four: 7 a.m. \u2014 It's time to get ready for work, but I can't even open my eyes. I had a crazy restless night with multiple nightmares, and now I feel like I've been hit by a bus. Is a fast food hangover a thing?? I hit snooze on my alarm and pray that a little extra rest will put out this dumpster fire of a headache. My cat hops up onto the bed and curls up with me, and I nap for about half an hour. 9:30 a.m. \u2014 I get out of a meeting and decide there's no way I can make it through the rest of this morning without breakfast. Normally I'm not really hungry in the morning, so I just drink water and wait until lunch to eat, but I'm sluggish and useless this morning, so I head to the cafeteria for a cup of fruit salad ($2.19 after 20% discount) and then to the caf\u00e9 for green tea ($3.71). The barista this morning is new, and she overcharges me by mistake, but I'm too tired to complain. When I get back to my desk and open the fruit salad, all the strawberries burst out into my lap. What a day! I read today's theSkimm newsletter and scroll through my Facebook newsfeed while I eat.  $5.90 12:15 p.m. \u2014 Every Thursday I have a lunch date with my boyfriend, and today we decide on sushi. We order tuna tataki, smoked salmon, and whitefish sushi, plus spicy tuna rolls. Even though it's not busy, the service is really slow and it takes us almost my entire lunch break just to get our food. I scarf down my portion and then dash back to work. My boyfriend covers the check ($53.71). Advertisement 4:30 p.m. \u2014 I leave work for the day feeling particularly worn out. Lucky for me, I'm going with my boyfriend to a fancy end-of-year banquet tomorrow night, so I have an appointment at my favorite local day spa for a gel manicure. I don't get gel polish anywhere else \u2014 this place offers an environmentally friendly gel system that's made from seaweed. I go for a soft pink shade in honor of the season. The service itself is $55 and I leave a 20% tip for my manicurist.  $66 5:45 p.m. \u2014 I head home from the spa to grab a snack and am pleased to see that my dress from Rent the Runway has arrived! I eat a few Swedish ginger thins and then head to a nearby nail salon for a pedicure. They honestly do a better job at this salon than at the fancy spa I was at earlier, and it's basically half the price ($28, plus 20% tip). Once my toes are dry, I head back home for dinner. We make grilled cheese sandwiches with real cheddar and dunk them into tomato bisque. After dinner, my boyfriend plays a video game and I watch for a while before going to the bedroom to read. I fall asleep with my book on my chest at around 11 p.m.  $33.60 Daily Total: $105.50", "day_five": "Day Five: 6 a.m. \u2014 I going to work early today because I want to leave work early to get ready for tonight's banquet. I hit the shower and am at work by 7:15 a.m. I'm starving, so I head to the cafeteria for scrambled eggs and toast. They're out of normal orange juice this morning, so I get an Odwalla juice (at a ridiculous markup!) instead. While I'm eating, I check my online banking and notice that our utility bill for this month has finally gone through. I send a Venmo request to my boyfriend for his half of the bill.  $7.93 Advertisement 12 p.m. \u2014 My department is holding a lunchtime networking reception today at another hospital. Fortunately, I'm able to catch a ride with a coworker instead of spending money on an Uber. We have to do a bunch of embarrassing icebreakers, but the free food nearly makes up for it. 4 p.m. \u2014 I head home to get ready for the banquet. When I arrive, I find my new Le Tote package by the mailbox. I'm glad it came so quickly, because I had picked out a pair of earrings that will look great with my dress! We leave around 5:30 but get stuck in traffic on our way to the venue, which is a fancy restaurant downtown. Fortunately, we arrive before they start serving dinner. The event starts winding down at around 8, so we walk back to the car. My feet are feeling pretty raw from my shows. When we get home, I fall asleep while my boyfriend looks for a movie on Netflix. Truly a glamorous evening! Daily Total: $7.93", "day_six": "Day Six: 10 a.m. \u2014 I wake up feeling refreshed, but when I get out of bed I realize just how serious my blister situation is. I'm first aid certified, so I treat the blisters and apply blister bandages before packing up my Rent the Runway return. My boyfriend is still asleep, so I take my time getting ready for the day. Once my boyfriend is up, we head over to the nearest UPS store to drop off the package. There's a Smoothie King in the same strip mall, so we grab smoothies for breakfast. I get a small Dark Chocolate Banana and he gets a medium Caribbean Way. He pays, but I Venmo him for mine.  $5.29 Advertisement 11 a.m. \u2014 We stop by my parents' house to return my sister's shoes, which I had borrowed to wear last night. My boyfriend immediately conks out on the couch, so I spend quality time with the dog and my sister. When my boyfriend wakes up, it's already 1 p.m. and he wants lunch. We decide to go for tacos and invite my sister to come with. Since it was my boyfriend's idea to go out for lunch, he pays ($63). 3 p.m. \u2014 We drop my sister off at home and head to the mall to run errands. My boyfriend needs a new pair of jeans, since he recently wore through a belt loop on his favorite pair, and I want to pick up essentials at Sephora since it's their Beauty Insider sale this weekend. I'm a VIB, so I get 15% off. I pick up a bottle of Ouai Wave Spray and decide to try their dry shampoo as well, since the store is out of my usual brand. I also get a travel size tube of Pinwheel's Wild Child perfume because I really liked the free sample I received one time. It comes to $63.27, but I have $35 in store credit from a past return. I put the rest on my debit card.  $28.27 5 p.m. \u2014 Head to the grocery store to pick up ingredients for dinner. We buy a pound of boneless skinless chicken thigh filets and broccoli, as well as two kinds of La Croix and pineapple juice. My boyfriend insists on getting a half dozen donuts, too, and I don't protest too much. When we get home, we make Cajun chicken with mashed potatoes and steamed broccoli for dinner, which we eat at around 7. We haven't done a great job of cooking at home this week, so hopefully tonight is a sign that we're back on the wagon. After dinner, we watch a comedy special on Netflix while waiting for our friends to get back from the movies so that we can go out together.  $25.42 Advertisement 10 p.m. \u2014 Our friends call to let us know that they've arrived at the rooftop bar we were planning to go to, but they're at capacity and our friends don't want to wait to be let in, so they decide to go to a house party instead.

On Sundays, I use a weekly clarifying shampoo followed by a deep conditioning hair mask instead of my usual shampoo and conditioner. When I'm done in the shower, I spray it all over with foaming bleach spray. While I wait for the shower to disinfect, I throw on a ceramide sheet mask. (I got a huge variety pack of sheet masks from a secret Santa exchange this past Christmas and I'm still working my way through them.) 11 a.m. \u2014 It's Fleet Week, so my boyfriend and I are meeting up with a mutual friend to tour the ships that are docked at the Port of New Orleans. On the way to meet our friend, we stop at Smoothie King, and I get another dark chocolate banana smoothie.  $5.77 3 p.m. \u2014 After touring a French Navy ship, a Canadian Navy ship, and a U.S. Navy ship, we are starving (and sunburnt)! We stop at a local Mexican chain restaurant, where I get a chicken burrito, a strawberry churro, and an iced tea. After we eat, we head back to the river to see all the tall ships that are docked there. The lines are way too long to go on any of the tours, but we get cool pictures. After we pass by the last of the ships, we walk back to our friend's apartment building to pick up the car.  $15.50 Advertisement 6:30 p.m. \u2014 I suggest that we eat last night's leftovers for dinner so that we don't end up forgetting them in the fridge. After dinner, we do more chores around the house until my boyfriend leaves for his weekly game night. While scrolling through my Facebook feed, I notice that a classmate from undergrad is hosting a birthday fundraiser. It's a good cause, so I make a donation.

I send an email to the office letting everyone know, and make my way to the kitchen for a cup of coffee and a donut. 9:30 a.m. \u2014 I remember it's payday and immediately get to paying my bills. I pay half of my reoccurring monthly bills every payday, so I pay my phone and car insurance bills. I also put $750 towards my credit card and move $385 into Digit for rent and bills later on down the road. 10:30 a.m. \u2014 I get a text from a friend inviting me to the spring sample sale for the designer she works for. As much as I'd like to go to support her, my budget doesn't allow for anything costly right now and the times sadly interfere with my work schedule, so I respectfully decline. This is the fourth time she's invited me to a sample sale and I've had to decline, so I have a feeling it will probably be the last. Advertisement 12 p.m. \u2014 I scarf down the last of the fried rice I brought from home and go for a mile-long power walk. Everything is blooming and it is just lovely. I attempt to meditate in my car when I get back to the office, but my Headspace app won't load, so I scroll Instagram for a bit and catch up with my aunt on WhatsApp. She's heading to Chile for one of our cousin's weddings and it saddens me that I can't attend. Living in a different country than half of my family isn't always easy. 1 p.m. \u2014 Apparently there was an earthquake while I was out on my walk and everyone is talking about it. Super confused because I didn't feel a thing, so I make tea and check the  L.A. Times , which calls the earthquake \u201cthe most powerful in years.\u201d I grew up with hurricanes, so I find earthquakes intriguing yet terrifying at the same time. 3:30 p.m. \u2014 Tea time. I also grab a Snyder's 100-calorie pack from the office snack cabinet. My office provides K-cup coffee, Nespresso, soda, tea, and a variety of healthy snacks. 5 p.m. \u2014 I'm meeting my old roomie/bestie for birthday drinks tonight after her exam, so I head home to relax for a bit. I'm ravenous, but my fridge is basically empty, so I run down to the Jersey Mike's under my building and get a turkey sandwich combo. I devour the entire thing in less than 10 minutes, like a savage. Then I watch last night's episode of  Life Sentence  on the CW (seriously the cutest show!) and crawl into bed to unwind, since I'm still not feeling well. My best friend from college texts me asking if I felt the earthquake, and we end up chatting for two hours about her upcoming trip and life in general. She just moved to a new state with her boyfriend and is feeling the struggle of making new friends as an adult.  $12.30 Advertisement 8:30 p.m. \u2014 The birthday girl is unable to get out of class early, so we reschedule for next Wednesday. I'm secretly relieved, since my anxiety has been through the roof today. I take a quarter of a Xanax and a long hot shower, Shiseido hair mask and all. Then I blow dry my hair and jade roll my face using my favorite Kiehl's Midnight Recovery Concentrate while watching  Happy Anniversary  on Netflix. The movie is terrible, so I turn it off halfway and get sucked into the black hole that is natural skincare on Instagram. 10:15 p.m. \u2014 Earplugs and silk eye mask, and then I'm out like a light. Daily Total: $12.30", "day_two": "Day Two: 7:10 a.m. \u2014 It's another chill morning in L.A., so I stay snuggled up in my cloud of a bed a little longer than usual. I do my extensive skincare regimen, jade roller and all, apply minimal makeup to make me look alive, and throw loose curls in my naturally wavy hair. I drink my morning Bragg apple cider vinegar and I'm out the door in under 30 minutes. Today is the first day in what feels like forever that I wake up feeling well. 9:45 a.m. \u2014 I am surprisingly not hungry this morning, but I force myself to drink a protein shake anyways. The Reset360 shakes are my absolute favorite! They are so satisfying, yet so delicious \u2014 I highly recommend. Friday is bagel day at the office, so I squirrel away two bagels for the weekend (it's all about balance). I take my vitamins and check my phone for the first time all morning and see that my boyfriend, E., has sent me a slew of sweet morning texts. Morning made. Advertisement 11:15 a.m. \u2014 I fill up my S'well water bottle (I drink a ton of water and probably refill it about 10 times throughout the work day), make myself another mug of green tea with added collagen powder, and snack on pistachios from my desk stash. 12 p.m. \u2014 I run to Trader Joe's for my weekly haul and end up just buying things to tide me over for the next couple of weeks. I buy organic strawberries, bananas, apples, shredded carrots, a tomato, mixed greens, frozen pineapples, frozen mangos, a frozen tropical fruit blend, mushrooms, spiraled carrots, turkey meatballs, a large bag of organic chicken breasts, green tea mochi, green tea, organic maple syrup, pasta sauce, miso ginger salad dressing, hummus, two ThinkThin Brownie Crunch bars, reduced sodium pistachio nuts, roasted seaweed snacks, coconut water, and three bottles of wine. I get back to the office and make a large smoothie with greens, frozen fruit, and chia seeds.  $115.32 3:30 p.m. \u2014 I take a break from work to order more Vitamin C serum on Amazon Prime.  $19.99 5:30 p.m. \u2014 E. declares tonight a date night. I quickly change, and we walk down to the ocean. The beachfront hotel/restaurant on the boardwalk he wanted to take me to is slammed, so we turn around and head to our favorite beach-y dive bar. We each order two Bud Lights, split a small basket of fries, and catch up on life and the status of where I'm at with my debt repayment. I love how transparent we are with our finances and how supportive we both are of each other. E. pays ($42), and we head to the pier to catch the sunset. Advertisement 7:20 p.m. \u2014 Neither of us is in the mood to fight the crowds at a formal restaurant, so we decide on Wagyu burgers at a new fast casual spot in the neighborhood. We each get a double cheese burger, and E. gets a beer. The burgers are AMAZING. His treat. 8:15 p.m. \u2014 We make a pit stop for froyo on our walk home. I get an original with a variety of chocolatey toppings, and E. gets a little of everything. He treats again. 8:45 p.m. \u2014 Home and shower time. We share a bottle of wine from my Trader Joe's haul and watch the season finale of  Vanderpump Rules  on Bravo. So trashy, yet so satisfying! It's our guilty pleasure. 10:30 p.m. \u2014 Skincare routine, then I'm out like a light.

We stay snuggled up in bed for a while and start making moves for the day when the alarm goes off. E. showers while I make the bed, and then he makes us breakfast while I steam our clothes. We split an everything bagel with scrambled eggs, turkey sausage, and nutritional yeast, and I put our new Ninja blender to the test and make us a shake with chocolate protein powder, water, banana, and chia seeds. We split it, and E. cleans the kitchen while I get ready for the day. 9:15 a.m. \u2014 We're heading to Newport Beach today, so I make a quick stop at Costco to fill up my gas tank before we hit the road ($50.15). We make it in a little under an hour, which allows us time to walk around and explore the sleepy town for a bit. Oh the beauty that is being on the road before 11 a.m. during a weekend in Los Angeles! I pay for five hours of parking, just to be safe ($7.80).  $57.95 Advertisement 11 a.m. \u2014 Whale watching time! I bought us tickets on Groupon a couple of weeks ago. It was supposed to be a surprise for E., but I accidentally blurted it out over wine last weekend. Whoops! He gives me his card to go get us a round of drinks at the bar on the ship. I get us each a Bloody Mary and a small bag of Fritos to share, since I am feeling a bit seasick. I tip 15% because the bartender was so friendly ($32). 1:30 p.m. \u2014 The trip was such a treat. We saw two whales and a bunch of sea lions. My favorite part was just being out on the water and away from the hustle and bustle of city life. I grew up on the water and find myself missing the simplicity of island life a lot these days. 2:30 p.m. \u2014 On the road back home. Traffic is a nightmare and I end up getting rear-ended on the 405. Awesome. The other driver is in a rental car on his way back to LAX to catch a flight home, so we exchange contact and insurance info, plus I get his Hertz information. I'm really shaken up, but somehow I hold it together. 4 p.m. \u2014 I call my parents for advice as soon as I get home, because I've never been in an accident before. E. suggests fresh air, so we walk to the diner across the street for a late lunch. We share a Mediterranean platter and a turkey club with a side of steamed broccoli. I can't find my wallet, so he pays ($28). Advertisement 5:45 p.m. \u2014 I check my car for my wallet and realize that the hat I was wearing must have flown off in the accident, because it somehow made its way into the back of my car. No wonder my neck is sore. I wash my face to de-stress when I get back upstairs and open a bottle of wine for us to share. We drink it while watching the season finale of  Summer House . 8 p.m. \u2014 I'm still pretty full from our late lunch, but E. is hungry, so I make us lentil pasta. He goes to the grocery store across the street because he wants more red wine, and I only have a bottle of white left. I meditate while he's gone. 10:30 p.m. \u2014 E. spills his wine all over my carpet and coffee table. I take deep breaths and proceed to help him clean it up. He freaks out, and the next thing I know, he's leaving. Super confused as to why he's upset in the first place, but I offer to get him an Uber. He refuses and keeps trucking on. Stubborn men, I swear. He lets me know when he's home, and I take a quarter of a Xanax and go to sleep, exhausted from the day.

He expresses to me that dealing with my anxiety and depression has been really hard on him. This is hard to hear \u2014 I had no idea it had been affecting him so much. But it means a lot that my happiness means so much to him. Advertisement 2:30 p.m. \u2014 Make my way out of bed and shower. I throw three pieces of bacon in the oven before realizing that we used the last of my eggs yesterday morning. Too lifeless to care, I eat the bacon without eggs and spend the rest of my afternoon on the couch watching movies while doing a series of face masks. 5:30 p.m. \u2014 I throw a Stouffer's Tuna Noodle Casserole in the oven and pop some popcorn. My sister texts me to cancel our plans for tomorrow. Apparently she has a work outing she forgot about and asks me if we can reschedule. I find myself aimlessly scrolling Instagram for the umpteenth time today, and then decide to delete the stupid app once and for all. 8:30 p.m. \u2014 I cut up strawberries and pack up a week's worth of snacks to bring to work with me in the morning. Then I go to sleep hoping for a better day tomorrow. Daily Total: $0", "day_five": "Day Five: 6:45 a.m. \u2014 Monday, we meet again. I make my bed, open all the blinds, and do my usual skincare routine. Then I make a chocolate banana protein shake to bring to the office with me, water my orchid, and place it by an open window to get fresh air for the day. Traffic is a nightmare this morning, but I still make it to to the office by 8 a.m. 9 a.m. \u2014 Work is the last place I want to be right now. We have our weekly office meeting and I sit in the back to avoid having to talk to anyone. I'm usually really good at plastering a smile on my face when I'm down and pretending to be my usual cheerful self, but I am finding it impossible to shake this funk today. I text my therapist when the meeting is over to see if she can see me tomorrow instead of Wednesday. In the meantime, E. texts me to wish me a wonderful day and to apologize again. He asks if he can see me tonight to make it up to me. I decide to wait until I hear back from my therapist to respond. Advertisement 10:35 a.m. \u2014 I eat a ThinkThin protein bar while drinking my third mug of tea for the day. 12 p.m. \u2014 I make avocado and lox toast sprinkled with Trader Joe's Everything But The Bagel seasoning and crushed red pepper, and then call Hertz to file a claim from the accident on Saturday. I drink the shake I brought from home while on the phone. They give me a claim number and tell me I should hear back from them within five business days with the next steps. 1 p.m. \u2014 I get back to the office and file a claim with my insurance company online. It looks like I won't be hearing from them for another day or so either. What a mess. My therapist texts me to tell me that she's unable to move our appointment to tomorrow, so I text E. back telling him he can come over tonight. 5 p.m. \u2014 Feeling emotionally and mentally drained, so I call my sister on my drive home to see if she's free on Friday afternoon. We haven't been on speaking terms since last summer, so the call brings up a ton of emotions. We laugh and we cry, and I hang up feeling like a huge weight has been lifted off my chest. 5:30 p.m. \u2014 I change into workout clothes and then E. and I go for a long walk to talk things out. Fighting isn't a normal thing for us since we normally communicate very well, but I can't help but feel that we are stronger because of it. Advertisement 6:45 p.m. \u2014 We go to an Asian fusion restaurant we both like on the 3rd Street Promenade for a glass of wine. They tell us it's happy hour all night, and since it's so nice outside, we decide to make an impromptu date night out of it. We take advantage of the incredibly low prices and order pretty much everything on the menu. E. has three beers and I have three glasses of ros\u00e9. The bartender feels bad that the kitchen is backed up and gives us a free shot of a delicious whiskey and hibiscus concoction. E. insists on paying ($109 plus tip). We walk home feeling full and happy. 9 p.m. \u2014 We settle in for season 2 of  Vanderpump Rules  on Hulu. 10:30 p.m. \u2014 E. has a sweet tooth, so I bake him chocolate chip cookies and do my skincare routine before crawling into bed for the night. Earplugs and silk eye mask, then it's light out. Daily Total: $0", "day_six": "Day Six: 7 a.m. \u2014 Thankful to the hangover gods for doing me a solid and not hitting me hard this morning. We shower and E. makes my bed and tidies up the kitchen while I get ready for work. I made a comment to E. last night that I forgot to water my plants (crazy plant lady alert \u2014 I have close to 20), and the next thing I know, he's moved all of my plants into the kitchen and is watering them. What a guy. We place them on the coffee table by the open balcony door to sunbathe for the day. He walks me to my car and kisses me goodbye before heading back home. Advertisement 9:30 a.m. \u2014 Another busy morning at the office. I eat a ThinkThin bar and sip on Earl Grey tea while working. 11 a.m. \u2014 I sign for the Georgetown Cupcakes delivery I ordered for one of our employee's birthdays. They are seriously the cutest. 11:15 a.m. \u2014 My boss asks me to go to Target with him to return items he bought and I oblige. We discuss a new birthday policy for the office while in the car, because I've noticed a trend of quite a few birthdays going unrecognized despite being on his calendar. 12 p.m. \u2014 Back at the office. A coworker and I decide it's too beautiful of a day to eat inside, so we prep our lunches to go. I make a tropical fruit and chia seed smoothie and the same avocado lox toast as yesterday. We eat at a communal lunch area down the street and he updates me on all the lady happenings in his life. He tends to go for younger girls and I find his love life to be so entertaining. 2:44 p.m. \u2014 I take a shot of apple cider vinegar and cut up an apple to snack on along with my pistachios. I sip on green tea with collagen powder while I do research on the best sites to post the intern position we are looking to fill for the summer. 4 p.m. \u2014 I text my cousin via WhatsApp to confirm dinner next Monday when she's in town. I see that E. texted me a picture of the refund check from my old landlord which arrived today (my old roommate and I didn't know where we would be living, so we had it sent to his apartment). I notice our landlord deducted $600, so I text him immediately, as well as my old roomie. She's pretty pissed, because we left the apartment in far better shape than it was in when we moved in, and we had to live with termites for several months. I shrug it off for now and make a plan to put $200 towards joining the YMCA down the street from my apartment ($150 initiation fee, plus a $50 membership). I cancelled my kickboxing membership in the New Year, as I couldn't justify the high cost, and have been dying to get back into the gym. Advertisement 5:30 p.m. \u2014 I check the mailroom and see that my package from Amazon was stolen (RIP Vitamin C Serum), so I walk over to the leasing office and let them know. This is my third package that has either not shown up or been stolen since I moved into this apartment a couple of weeks ago. I'm very frustrated, but I decide not to let it ruin my day. I snack on pretzels and hummus while I marinate chicken in TJ's Soyaki, run the dishwasher, and change into shorts. I grab my book,  The Carpenter , and go read up on the roof area. 6:30 p.m. \u2014 I shower and then sage myself and my apartment. I've had seriously bad luck for several months now, so I'm really hoping this helps. I accidentally scratch the burn on my forehead from my curling iron and end up bleeding everywhere. 7 p.m. \u2014 I put Polysporin on my scab, and then it's dinner time. I throw on my favorite Ben Howard record while I cook the chicken I marinated and make a salad with mixed greens, tomato, shredded carrots, and carrot ginger dressing. I bought the dressing on a whim, and I have to say it is DELICIOUS! I pack the leftovers for lunch tomorrow. 8 p.m. \u2014 It's a beautiful night, so I drink tea on the couch and stare aimlessly out my open balcony door at the city lights. Then I write in my gratitude journal and reflect on past entries. I haven't written in a while and I'm starting to realize how much it affects me when I don't. Advertisement 9 p.m. \u2014 I crawl into bed and scroll through OfferUp to look at coffee tables, since E. is insisting on replacing the one he ruined over the weekend. I fall in love with a vintage bohemian table on the app, but it's sadly already been sold. My old one, which was only a few months old, is on sale, so I'll probably just get the same one. 10:15 p.m. \u2014 I go to sleep proud of myself for having three consecutive days of no spending.

I also munch on strawberries. I take the rest of my daily vitamins: super algae, vitamin D3, a multivitamin, and 5-Htp. 10:30 a.m. \u2014 It's a very quiet day at the office, so I write E.'s mom a thank you card for the housewarming present she sent me a couple of weeks ago. Call me old-fashioned, but I prefer sending handwritten cards over digital ones any day. Advertisement 11:20 a.m. \u2014 Hungry and bored, I snack on roasted seaweed and catch up on today's Money Diary. The comment section gets me every single time. Like a trashy romcom, I just can't stop reading. 12 p.m. \u2014 All of the McDonald's talk in that MD has me craving nuggets, so I abandon the salad I brought from home and get a Mighty Kids Meal. Everything is sadly overcooked and flavorless, but I am ravenous. I reschedule a laser hair appointment while in the drive-through.  $4.81 12:30 p.m. \u2014 I make a smoothie with the greens from my salad, strawberries, frozen fruit, and chia seeds. I also take a shot of apple cider vinegar to prevent heartburn later on in the day. I have to leave work early today, so I cut my lunch break short. 3:30 p.m. \u2014 After about an hour of reading California renters rights, I decide to message my dad the itemized deduction list from my landlord along with all of the photos I took of the unit before we moved out. My parents are landlords, and although they're in a different state, I can use any advice I can get. $450 for paint just isn't settling well with me. I re-read our lease and email the landlord requesting itemized receipts for the deductions. I mentally prepare to have to go to small claims court. 5:15 p.m. \u2014 I meet with my therapist for our biweekly appointment ($35). I've been seeing her for several months and I really look forward to our sessions. Not only do I feel like they've been helping me grow as a person, but I've also noticed an improvement with my communication skills and a better handle on controlling my emotions and stress. I'm a work in progress, but I always leave our sessions with a clearer head. Advertisement 6:20 p.m. \u2014 I run up to my apartment to grab my denim jacket and change purses before walking over to the wine bar across the street. The place is packed, but I somehow snag two seats at a communal high top and order a bottle of cabernet while I wait for my old roomie/bestie. We haven't seen each other in three weeks, and you'd think it would have been a lifetime with the hug we have when she walks through the door. We spend over three hours catching up about everything under the sun and share two bottles of wine and a small meat lover's flatbread. Bottles are half off on Wednesdays, so we each spend $29.77 plus tip.  $35 10 p.m. \u2014 What a week! I chat on the phone with the BF while doing my skincare routine.

I throw clothes on and do my morning skin care routine of exfoliating toner, vitamin C serum, moisturizer, and sunscreen. We put the puppy in his jacket and are out the door by 8:20. 8:45 a.m. \u2014 We drop the puppy off at daycare before we go our separate ways downtown.

A few months ago, I bought a coffee maker specifically to save money on coffee, but I couldn't be bothered to use it this morning, so I go to the coffee shop downstairs in my building and get an Americano.

I typically work on environment-focused projects, but as a consultant, sometimes I help out with marketing and project management tasks to fill out my billable hours. I take a break to go down the street to a lunch buffet place that I love. They charge by the weight, but I pretty much get the same thing every time, and it's rarely over $6.50.

Days when the dog goes to daycare are great because he's so tired he doesn't want to go on a walk in the evening, which gives us extra time. I give the dog dinner and then snack on Kettle Chips and iced tea while I work on adding addresses to our wedding guest list. We're getting married later this year, and even though we're trying to keep it relatively low key, we're planning and paying for the wedding mostly ourselves, so there's a lot to do. 7:30 \u2014 G. makes pad see ew noodles with chicken and broccoli for dinner. After dinner, I clean the kitchen and eat Rolos. I have big plans to do more chores and maybe work out, but instead, I pour a glass of wine, do my nightly face routine (retinol serum, hyaluronic acid, and moisturizer) and paint my nails. We've been looking at flights to Oakland for later this summer for our unofficial bachelor/bachelorette weekend, and decide tonight's the night to buy.

This is my second appointment, so I have a good idea of what I'm actually looking for. My stylist pulls dresses from the list I brought and we start with the ones I've been staring at online the most. I end up falling in love with the first dress I try on and comparing all the others to that one. I try the first dress on again, and I think it's the one! As an added bonus, it just went on a major sale! Like, $1,000 off, major sale! My mom offered to pay for the dress and gave me a pretty big budget, but I've been setting a personal budget of under $1,000. Our wedding isn't going to be extravagant, and I would just feel guilty and uncomfortable wearing a super expensive dress.

Once I get to my desk, I have my coffee from home and make oatmeal while I respond to emails and make my to-do list for the day. Advertisement 1 p.m. \u2014 For lunch I heat up leftover Indian. While I eat, I organize my finances: pay my credit card bill, move money from my savings to my checking for upcoming wedding expenses, and move $2,000 from my savings into my investment account. 3 p.m. \u2014 This has felt like a very long Wednesday and I am feeling PMS-y, so I feel like I deserve a treat. I go downstairs to get a cardamom vanilla latte from the coffee shop.  $5.51 5 p.m. \u2014 I decide to walk home, since it's only slightly raining. I get a call from my sister, who asks me to help her find a new computer, since her Mac broke, and she's going back to school to get her teaching Master's soon. Last year I bought a Lenovo for less than $250 after my Mac died, and she wants a similar deal. When I get home, G. and I take the doggo for a nice long walk. 6:30 p.m. \u2014 G. makes veggie lentil soup while I call my mom. I thank her for the jean jacket she got me as an early birthday present that just came in the mail. I told her not to get me anything since she's helping out with a lot of wedding stuff, but she got me a present anyway. I send an email to the wedding caterer, because they just sent us a contract that says their catering minimum is $3,000 \u2014 which is almost $1,000 over what they quoted us!

Package up the rest of the leftover Indian food. G. and I walk the dog to daycare and I'm at work just before 9. I drink the coffee I made at home and eat my Clif Bar for breakfast. 12:30 p.m. \u2014 I planned on eating leftover Indian for lunch, but G. IMs me saying he's craving guacamole and asks if I want to meet him at Chipotle for lunch. We don't usually meet up for lunch like this, so it feels like a treat when we do. I get a chicken burrito bowl and G. gets a chicken burrito. We pay separately. G. wants to go spy on the dog at daycare, so we walk by and watch him through the big windows. All the dogs in the room are napping, but our dog is begging for treats from the attendant! We don't want to disturb the peace, so we leave once one of the dogs notices us and starts barking.  $8.09 3 p.m. \u2014 I can feel myself start to drag, especially after my big lunch, so I grab an Americano from downstairs.  $3.69 5 p.m. \u2014 G. is going to a work happy hour tonight, so I pick up the dog and we go home and lay on the couch together. I remember I need to get my sister a birthday present, so I order her a face mask and Balm Dot Com from Glossier. G. is back just before 7, and we eat leftover lentil soup for dinner.  $34 Advertisement 7:30 p.m. \u2014 We go to the climbing gym!

I'm at my desk by 8:45, eat a Clif Bar, and take my vitamin D.  $3.69 12:30 \u2014 Lunch is leftover Indian that I packed yesterday. While I'm eating, I get an email from my health insurance with a claim for the insulin pump supplies I bought two weeks ago. (I'm a type 1 diabetic.) I cringe at the bill for $407.10 and decide to wait until the bill from the pump supply company comes, to avoid overpaying the insurance. The supplies should last me three months, but I need to do research to see if I can bring the cost of the supplies down. On a happier note, a friend sends me an invite to a networking/socializing event next week for a talk about salmon habitat restoration at a brewery! 5 p.m. \u2014 I take the bus home, and then G. and I take the dog on a walk while we discuss what we want to do tonight. We try to make Friday nights feel like date night even though we spend most nights together. The dog is not happy that it's sprinkling outside, but we make it home without incident. Advertisement 7 p.m. \u2014 We decide we want to get tacos and then go to a barcade! It's raining out, but we walk anyway. That was a mistake \u2014 we only make it about four blocks before we're drenched! Our pants and jackets are completely soaked through, which is not normal for Seattle rain! We decide we won't be happy sitting anywhere with completely wet clothes, so we turn around and go home. We contemplate changing and taking a Lyft, but decide we're over it and drive to get Thai food. We order chicken satay, pad see ew, and yellow curry. G. pays.

I have 30 days to return it for a full refund, so I may do another shopping trip in the next couple of weeks just to make sure there isn't one I like better. While I'm in the wedding organizing mood, I call the caterer to negotiate the contract and am able to secure our original quote! Success! I edit the contract before I sign it to make sure they don't go back on their word later, and pay the 50% deposit.  $1,160.50 Advertisement 11 a.m. \u2014 Puppy is bored, but it's raining, so I put off our walk for later, hoping to catch a break in the rain. G. and I walk to a coffee shop and talk about the personal projects we're working on while we sip cappuccinos. I pay.  $8.37 12 p.m. \u2014 I go to get my hair trimmed and dyed. I've been slowly transitioning out of (the expensive world of) being super blonde, and today is the first time I dip my toes into darker dye. It turns out great! It looks very natural and I love it. I tip $35. While I'm at the salon, I get my sister a hard-to-find purple conditioner ($25) for her very blonde hair.  $252.65 3 p.m. \u2014 We take a super wet walk to the dog park. The dog gets to play with two other pups there! By the time we get back to the apartment, I have to peel off soaked jeans again and the dog is shivering, so we snuggle under a blanket and turn on the TV. 6 p.m. \u2014 Think about trying to go out to make up for last night, but it's still raining hard, so we decide to spend the night at home. Eat leftover Thai, play video games, and watch TV. 9 p.m. \u2014 G. braves the outside to walk to the market to get beers \u2014 I give him a rare $20 bill (I never have cash) for a six-pack for me and a bomber for him. He gives me $4 back. We watch a movie and then go to sleep.  $16 Advertisement Daily Total: $1,437.52", "day_seven": "Day Seven: 9 a.m. \u2014 G. gets coffees and donuts from Top Pot for breakfast. We take the doggo on a walk and then plan our meals for the week, which helps us keep track of how much we're spending on food and really limits the amount of food we waste. This week were going to make pizza, cilantro jalape\u00f1o chicken, and enchiladas. 12 p.m. \u2014 This is my week to pay for groceries. We walk to QFC to get chicken broth, pizza crust mix, juice, oatmeal, tomato sauce, pretzels, cilantro, cheddar and mozzarella cheese, tortillas, frozen mac and cheese, Clif Bars, onions, jalape\u00f1os, bread, potatoes, sour cream, potato chips, bell peppers, mushrooms, chicken thighs, ground beef, mouthwash, and a case of La Croix. We recently started using reusable mesh bags for our produce, which really cuts down our plastic usage. When we get back, I put the groceries away and eat a frozen mac and cheese for lunch.  $95.70 1:30 p.m. \u2014 I decide to go to a coffee shop and do a little bit of work on my computer. I've been trying to go to new coffee shops outside of my usual routine, because it makes me feel like I'm constantly exploring the city and helps me feel like I'm not stuck in a rut. I stop in Dick Blick on the way for a notebook, ruler pencil, and eraser  ($17.27) to sketch out and make notes on creative projects that have been sitting in my head and need to be put on paper. When I get to the coffee shop, I order a cappuccino ($5.40). The coffee is good and the shop is really cute, but the vibe feels like I'm an outsider in locals-only territory \u2014 not a feeling I super enjoy \u2014 especially as I'm trying to make a serious effort to feel more ingrained in my neighborhood. I've lived in Seattle for almost three years, but it's been a little hard to break into the social scene and people are weary of new transplants \u2014 even though it feels like most people I meet aren't from Seattle either.  $22.67 Advertisement 4 p.m. \u2014 Go to the climbing gym. Making progress! Feeling good! 6 p.m. \u2014 Make pizza for dinner. I chop veggies while G. works on the crust he started earlier in the afternoon. He's on a mission to perfect a gluten-free pizza crust that we can both enjoy. Tonight's pizza turns out good! But we both agree that the crust last week was better, so we'll try that one again next time. 8 p.m. \u2014 I somehow get both of us motivated to do deep cleaning that has been on my list for a while. I clean the bathroom and the kitchen floors while G. deep cleans the fridge and the kitchen counters. I finally take a shower and do an AHA/BHA exfoliating mask before heading to bed at 11.

I'm definitely not a morning person, and getting up is always hard for me. It doesn't help that my husband has a later start than I do. 7:45 a.m. \u2014 I am a big believer in breakfast, and hardly ever leave the house without eating. I grab a cup of low-fat yogurt and mix in chocolate granola. I wash it down with a small glass of fresh squeezed OJ, followed by water and my vitamin D tablet and L-Lysine pills. I recently had a full physical done and my doctor said I was vitamin D-deficient and that my good (HDL) cholesterol levels were low, so I've been making a real effort to improve my diet and up those levels. 8:20 a.m. \u2014 Arrive at work and immediately grab a cup of water from our office water filter. I try to always have water at my desk and sip it throughout the day. 10:30 a.m. \u2014 Ponder going downstairs to the coffee place in my building for a latte, but remind myself that I did this yesterday and am trying not to make it a habit. I go for some free Earl Grey tea that we have stocked in the office instead. I brought a small bag of walnuts from home and munch on these as well. Apparently walnuts have lots of that good cholesterol that I'm lacking. Advertisement 11:30 a.m. \u2014 Head out on my lunch break to pick up my dry cleaning, only to discover it's not ready yet. Bummer. Decide to pop into a nearby Sephora and pick up this eye cream I like that was out of stock online, but apparently is in stock at this particular store. Today is just not my day \u2014 the store is out of stock as well. The salesperson is really nice and offers to call me when it's back in stock. I leave with a couple free samples of other products I've been eyeing. I'm kind of a skincare/makeup junkie\u2026 12:30 p.m. \u2014 Back at my desk, I eat a salad that I brought from home with pesto chicken, tomatoes, cucumbers, bell peppers, feta, and avocado (another great source of HDL cholesterol!). 2:30 p.m. \u2014 I meet with a group of about nine girls I work with to try to collectively win at HQ Trivia today. The prize is $300,000, and we've actually won as a group in the past ($12 each), so hopes are high! 3:30 p.m. \u2014 We didn't win :'( Oh well. Now I'm drained and in need of sugar. Luckily, I came prepared with a healthy option \u2014 a mix of raspberries, blackberries, and strawberries. I'm really into berries. They hit the spot. 4:30 p.m. \u2014 I leave work a little early to meet a woman who's interested in buying a faux cowhide rug I'm selling on OfferUp. Hopefully the sale goes through! I get such a high from reselling stuff. Before we moved from Amsterdam, I tried reselling most things we weren't taking along in our move, and I was pleasantly surprised by how easy it was to get rid of stuff and earn cash. Now I try to keep up the habit. Advertisement 5 p.m. \u2014 Aaaand she ghosted me. There were other people interested in the rug, so I start contacting them. 6:15 p.m. \u2014 Head to a spin class to get some cardio in. Since I moved to Houston, my sister has gotten me into spinning. I used to be a yoga-only kind of girl, but now I really enjoy mixing it up with a high energy, bass-thumping spin class. I try to do two yoga classes and one spin class a week. Keyword: \u201ctry.\u201d I have a couple classes left from a class pack I bought last month, so no charge for this one. 7:30 p.m. \u2014 And I've got a bite on the rug! Someone is on his way now to pick it up. Hooray! I quickly shower and meet the dude to make the exchange (+$40). 8 p.m. \u2014 My husband, D., and I have been trying to cook more during the week, so he whips us up a pasta with salmon and spinach for dinner. He's definitely the cook in our household. I'm okay at the basics, but I just don't feel very comfortable in the kitchen. We follow a \u201cyou cook, I clean\u201d method, which works out swimmingly. 8:45 p.m. \u2014 Tomorrow my sister-in-law and her husband are visiting us from Amsterdam! We're super excited for their visit and plan out our weekend with them while sipping green tea. 9 p.m. \u2014 I decide to quickly pop chocolate chip muffins (from a box mix, I admit) into the oven, so we have a sweet treat for our company upon their arrival tomorrow.

I use it with a gentle foaming cleanser and follow up with a retinol serum, eye cream, and moisturizer. 10:30 p.m. \u2014 Fall asleep relishing in the fact that I had a no-spend day!

I just turned 30 a couple months ago, so I actually haven't had a check-up in five years. Cue the anxiety. 9 a.m. \u2014 D. whips up eggs and bacon for everyone. I manage to get a couple bites down, but my nerves are getting the best of me. I mention how nervous I am, and D. offers to drop me off at my appointment so I don't have to drive and figure out parking (which can be difficult where this doctor's office is). 10:45 a.m. \u2014 We all pile in D.'s car. The crew gives me a pep talk in the car, and I try to do breathing exercises. 11:30 a.m. \u2014 After waiting for what feels like an eternity, I finally get called back.

I snack on the trail mix I have in my purse. 12 p.m. \u2014 I venture back to Sephora because the eye cream I was looking for last week is back in stock! It feels like a deal because I have a small remaining balance on a gift card.  $24.79 12:30 p.m. \u2014 Back at my desk, I start on my lunch. I made a salad last night with tomatoes, cucumbers, olives, avocado, and feta cheese. 3 p.m. \u2014 The salad didn't really do it for me, so when my coworker says she's making a Chick-fil-A run, I ask her to grab me a six-pack of nuggets. I kind of have a thing for nuggets. My cat's name is essentially \u201cchicken nugget\u201d in Dutch. I asked my coworker how much I owe her, and she says a million dollars. Well thanks, friend! 5:15 p.m. \u2014 I forgot that I signed up to participate in a chocolate chip cookie bake-off at work tomorrow. I run by the store to get supplies for my favorite brown butter cookie recipe: flour, vanilla extract, walnuts, butter, chocolate chips, and baking soda.  $19.63 Advertisement 5:45 p.m. \u2014 While my butter is softening to room temperature, I decide to clean the house. Having guests over is fun, but it's nice to have the house back to normal. Looking forward to alone time with D. tonight. He comes home while I'm in the middle of vacuuming and goes for a run. Once the house is tidied up, I start on the cookies. 7:30 p.m. \u2014 Even though I've already eaten a substantial amount of cookie dough, I decide it's probably a good idea to eat dinner. I warm up tomato basil soup and serve it with garlic bread. D. and I eat while watching  Along Came Polly . I forgot how funny that movie is! 8:30 p.m. \u2014 The cookies turn out perfectly! Feeling good about tomorrow. D. agrees that they are delicious. 10 p.m. \u2014 I start on my nighttime routine, excited to tuck in early. D. and I snuggle and read in bed together before lights out.

I'm one of those people who wakes up immediately when their alarm goes off. I lay out my clothes the night before, usually to save time in the morning. I brush my teeth, throw on some makeup, and grab a Greek yogurt to eat at work. I'm loving Chobani's rebrand. 8:15 a.m. \u2014 Get on the subway to work.

Advertisement 8 p.m. \u2014 Smoke a bowl and then start the first episode of  Queer Eye  with my roommates. 11 p.m. \u2014 I always lay out my clothes for the next day the night before, which seems childish, but it's actually a huge time-saver. I go through my skincare routine (Mario Badescu face wash, Clinique toner, and Klairs Freshly Juiced Vitamin C Serum) before falling asleep to an episode of the podcast  Hidden Brain .

I'm moving next month, and this is the main reason why. I make myself oatmeal and throw in a banana and brown sugar. 11:05 a.m. \u2014 Working on a difficult research report at work, and I'm struck by what we call \u201canalysis paralysis.\u201d I go for a walk. 11:45 a.m. \u2014 I've been wanting a pair of high-waisted light wash jeans for ages, and & Other Stories is having a sale, so I splurge.

I find that taking my lunch later helps break up my day. I usually like eating alone, so I grab a sandwich at a nearby deli and read my book.  $8.14 2:15 p.m. \u2014 I get a text from this guy T. who I met on Bumble confirming that we're on for tonight. I suggest a craft beer bar near my apartment. It has dim lighting, which is always a plus. We vibe really well over text, but I've learned the hard way that that's never a guarantee the date will go well. Advertisement 6 p.m. \u2014 Getting stressed before my date. I have a glass of ros\u00e9 at my apartment with my roommate to calm my nerves. I'm both a year-round iced coffee drinker and a year-round ros\u00e9 drinker. 9:15 p.m. \u2014 Shocked at how well the date went. We ended up each having three beers and splitting an appetizer. I offered to split, but he graciously paid. I make a mental note to insist on paying next time. 10 p.m. \u2014 I'm still hungry, so I heat up Trader Joe's edamame before bed.

I resist the urge to grab a bagel on my way to work and instead make an egg scramble with green peppers, onion, and tomato. 1 p.m. \u2014 I have an eye doctor appointment near my office. In order to buy contacts, you need a prescription from the last year, which I frankly find ridiculous, because my prescription hasn't changed in five years or so. I go ahead and purchase a year's supply, which is partially covered by insurance.  $152.42 6 p.m. \u2014 I leave work and take the subway to DeKalb Market Hall, a food court in Brooklyn, where I'm meeting an old coworker before we see Lorde perform later tonight. I buy pierogies and an Other Half IPA. I'm a huge beer fan, and I love the craft beer selection in NYC. I buy a beer for my friend, too, because she's in between jobs.  $27.28 Advertisement 9 p.m. \u2014 Lorde comes out! The crowd goes wild. Jack Antonoff ends up coming out, and they play \"New York\" by St. Vincent together. He's a fuck boy, but you could cut the sexual tension with a bread knife. 11:45 p.m. \u2014 Getting on a train at Barclays is a nightmare. I wait for 10 minutes and then end up taking a train that keeps getting delayed. It's late, and it's a weeknight, so I hail a cab.  $7.83 12:30 a.m. \u2014 Skimp out on my usual skincare routine, read a few pages of my new book  Homegoing , which is amazing, and then I'm out.

It's always a gamble trying out a new instructor, but the playlist is on point today. I pick up the protein shake/smoothie I ordered before class from the smoothie bar at the studio. It's a chocolate peanut butter combination with blueberries, automatically charged to my debit card. It's a great perk of this studio, but it adds up.  $7 8:55 a.m. \u2014 I swing by Starbucks and grab a grande iced coffee, unsweetened, with soy milk.

I recently switched from working in communications to working in research, which is closer to what I want to do, but it's a way less social environment, and I'm at my desk most of the time. 1:55 p.m. \u2014 I go to Chop't for lunch. I like Fresh&Co a lot better, but there isn't one by my office. I get a Mexican Caesar.  $10.12 2 p.m. \u2014 Excel is either my best friend or worst nightmare.

We make plans to go the Gutter (a bowling alley/bar in Brooklyn) on Saturday. 5 p.m. \u2014 Some coworkers invite me to get a drink with them after work. I feel like I've already drank a lot this week, but I want to socialize at my new job. 6:15 p.m. \u2014 We go to a divey bar and I legit gasp at how cheap drinks are. I get two beers, and I'm below the card minimum, so I buy one for my coworker.  $11.04 8 p.m. \u2014 Home and craving something spicy, so I head to Xi'an Famous Foods and get the tingly beef noodles.

I bring my own coffee and lunch today \u2014 I'm hoping I'll have time for a workout during my lunch break before heading out. I'm really bad about not eating breakfast (bad habit that I need to break), so I don't eat this morning. 11:30 a.m. \u2014 The morning is literally gone in the blink of an eye. I have an event to attend for a candidate announcing he's running for governor this year. I love election years; something about campaign season is so exciting to me. But because I almost forgot about this campaign event, I won't be able to go to the gym during my lunch break. 1 p.m. \u2014 After the campaign event, I run home to finish packing my bags and eat something before heading to my next event, where I'm teaching fifth graders about the Constitution and our founding fathers (though they could care less). On my way I stop at Sephora, because I've been scraping what's left of my Fenty foundation out of the bottle! I get a new bottle and somehow make it out of the store with just one thing.  $57.24 6 p.m. \u2014 After a hectic day of running around, I finally get to my out of town work destination. I'm a state employee, so when I travel out of town I get to drive a state car and my hotel room is covered, which is really nice. I meet coworkers at a Thai restaurant for dinner and order crab rangoon for the table (my favorite), green tea, and spicy basil leaves.  $22.08 Advertisement Daily Total: $79.32", "day_two": "Day Two: 6:45 a.m. \u2014 It's an early morning. Our board meeting starts at 8 a.m. but I like to get there early to get set up. I take advantage of the complimentary breakfast at the hotel and grab yogurt, granola, and coffee before heading out. 6 p.m. \u2014 The day has completely flown by! When I get back into town, I meet my boyfriend and all of our friends at Buffalo Wild Wings for dinner and beers for one of our friend's birthdays.  $33 8:30 p.m. \u2014 After dinner, we take our friend to our favorite dive bar. (The bar is literally like  Cheers \u2014  everyone knows everyone, all of our parents drank here when they were our age, and the owner coached my boyfriend in basketball when he was little, ha!) When it's your birthday, the bartender and owner always buy the first two rounds, so we took our friend to get his birthday drinks. This bar also has the best jukebox, and I always spend way too much money on it. Tonight I only spend $10, though, which I'm proud of myself for! I have two drinks ($15.50).  $25.50 Daily Total: $58.50", "day_three": "Day Three: 9 a.m. \u2014 I have a late start to my day today, but because I worked so much overtime yesterday at the board meeting, it's okay that I come in a little later than usual. On my way to the office, I stop and get a soy latte and a bagel. I'm feeling slightly hungover from last night \u2014 I swear I can't even have three drinks anymore without being hungover.  $8.78 Advertisement 1 p.m. \u2014 On Fridays I get off early because I work overtime during the week. I usually leave around noon, but today I stay until 1 because I'm feeling a little guilty for coming in later (even though I worked so much yesterday *eye roll*). On my way home, I text my boyfriend (who took the day off because he wasn't \"feeling well\") and ask if he wants me to grab us lunch on my way home. I stop and get tacos for him and a bean and cheese burrito for me. Tacos and burritos are the cure-all to hangovers! $7.76 for my half.  $7.76 5 p.m. \u2014 After a solid nap, I wake up feeling like a new person and apparently decide it's a good idea to spend $25.95 on a bandana from Barstool for our dog that says \"Saturdays Are For The Good Boys.\" So there's that. We head over to my boyfriend's dad's house for dinner with his dad, brother, and nephew.  $25.95 Daily Total: $42.49", "day_four": "Day Four: 8:30 a.m. \u2014 I just have to say, it's so nice to wake up without an alarm. I meet one of my friends for yoga at our gym and then we go to brunch, get bottomless mimosas (obvi), and share a flight of avocado toast and a scrambler. SO GOOD!  $27.35 12:30 p.m. \u2014 After brunch, we head to Target because I need to get new sheets and a comforter for our bed. Our dog ripped a little hole in our sheets, and then my BF put his foot through said hole getting into bed the other night \u2014 so now the hole is huge. We bought a king-sized bed last year and still use a queen comforter, so  the time is now  for new bedding. In my typical fashion, I can't leave Target without getting at least one other thing that I don't need, and end up getting new tea towels that say \"Everyday I'm Brusselin\" with brussels sprouts on them.  $58.88 Advertisement 3 p.m. \u2014 After Target, I drop my friend off at her car and head to the grocery store to get stuff for dinner. We're having some of our couple friends over for dinner to watch the NCAA tournament (Go Duke!). I'm making the jalape\u00f1o tuna casserole from Chrissy Teigen's cookbook,  Cravings . The total comes to $10.80 for my half (after splitting with my boyfriend).  $10.80 Daily Total: $97.03", "day_five": "Day Five: 8 a.m. \u2014 I wake up before my boyfriend, make myself coffee, and start breakfast for us. We already have everything I need, so I don't have to go to the store, which is always nice. I make us strawberry pancakes and bacon with fresh fruit, and then eat without him because I'm not letting these pancakes get cold! 12:30 p.m. \u2014 I head to the grocery store to get stuff for dinner and for game snacks. One of our friends is coming over for more NCAA tournament, and I'm making buffalo chicken dip, guacamole, salad, and potatoes for dinner. It's my boyfriend's turn to cook dinner, and he's grilling steaks and potatoes.  $20.82 9 p.m. \u2014 I try to dedicate Sundays to self-care to get ready for the week ahead. Sometimes that means eating my body weight in buffalo chicken dip and dark chocolate, and other times it means an expensive face mask and bubble bath. Today is a mixture of both. I'm in bed by 9 p.m. with a clean house and a full belly, reading my book ( An American Marriage \u2014  AMAZING, btw) until I fell asleep. Advertisement Daily Total: $20.82", "day_six": "Day Six: 8 a.m. \u2014 I'm trying really hard to tell myself to \"think positive thoughts, live a positive life\" \u2014 but Mondays suck. I make my coffee at home and pack whatever I can find for lunch because I'll make lunches for the week tonight after work. 1 p.m. \u2014 I usually pack lunch and eat in my office because I like to use my lunch hour to go to the gym. It's less crowded then, and the classes I like are usually during my lunch hour. Today I go to Body Pump, which kills me. When I get back to the office, I drink the soy protein drink I brought and eat a granola bar and veggie chips. My gym shoes are starting to wear out on the bottom, which is making the traction super slippery, so I order a new pair of Nikes.  $54.97 5:30 p.m. \u2014 When I get home from work, I wait for my BF to finish working out and then we head to the grocery store together to get stuff for dinner. We're making a turkey white bean chili tonight in the Instant Pot. We pretty much have everything we need except for beans, green chilis, and onion.  $2.36 7 p.m. \u2014 After we eat dinner, I make lunch for the week with stuff I already have at home. I try not to eat a lot of meat, so I make brown rice pasta with pesto and cherry tomatoes. I also download an app called You Need a Budget, which my brother-in-law and sister-in-law swear by. The first 34 days are free and after that it's $83 annually, which is about $7 a month. I'd like to get my yoga teaching certificate this fall, and it's super expensive to do that (about $3,000), so I'm trying to be more mindful and save up! Advertisement Daily Total: $57.33", "day_seven": "Day Seven: 7 a.m. \u2014 Back to the grind of my flex schedule, which means getting to work at 7 a.m. I surprisingly don't have too hard of a time waking up this morning! I grab my gym bag, pesto pasta bowl, and granola bar, and head out the door. When I get to the office this early, I'm usually the only one here, which I really enjoy because I can get a lot accomplished. I make coffee and get going on my to-do list. 12 p.m. \u2014 The workout class I want to go today isn't until 5 p.m., so I eat my lunch in my office and read articles during my lunch hour. I'm getting paid this Friday (thank goodness!), so I'm trying not to spend any money between now and then. But today our cable and internet bill automatically comes out of my account so there goes $176. Oh, and our poop guy payment (yes, we have a guy that comes and picks up the dog poop out of our backyard) was charged to our card today for the month. 6 p.m. \u2014 After my workout class, I head home and eat leftovers for dinner. We didn't plan on making anything for dinner tonight because we knew we'd be getting home a little later than usual. I enjoy alone time cleaning up the house, getting my gym bag ready for tomorrow, and reading before my BF gets home and we watch TV and get ready for bed.

I normally leave the house around 8:30, but I'm trying to get up a little earlier so that I can move at a slower pace and enjoy my mornings more. I throw on a kettle of hot water, pour myself a cup of green tea, and read through the morning news before getting dressed. 8:30 a.m. \u2014 Head out the door and walk down to the train station. My commute is made up of 30 minutes of walking to and from stations and 25 minutes on BART. I prefer it this way, though, because my job has me sitting for most of the day, and this is a consistent way for me to get in physical activity. 9:30 a.m. \u2014 Get into the office and grab a coconut chocolate Rxbar from the kitchen. Of all of the protein bars I've tried, these are by far the least offensive, though their texture can make them a little hard to chew. Still, it's a great way to get a good protein boost in the morning \u2014 I recommend the coconut chocolate or peanut butter flavor. I settle at my desk to start my work where I left off yesterday. 12 p.m. \u2014 My job has a lot of perks, but one of my favorites is that we have lunch and dinner catered every day! I head over to the caf\u00e9 with my team and load up on stir-fried veggies and tofu, baby spinach salad, and garlic roasted potatoes. My sweet tooth usually gets the best of me after lunch, but today I'm too stuffed for dessert. Advertisement 1 p.m. \u2014 Evidently I'm not too full for something else! My stomach leads me back to the kitchen, where I grab a cherry pie Larabar to snack on at my desk. 5 p.m. \u2014 Whew, finished! Spent most of the day poring over one specific bug in our codebase, and I'm so relieved that I figured out the underlying cause and got it resolved. I reward myself with a cup of freshly brewed chai and take a few minutes to relax before heading home. 6 p.m. \u2014 Back home for 30 minutes to grab a bite to eat before leaving again to hit the gym. All of the treadmills are taken, so I kill time on the elliptical while keeping an eye out for a free machine. Finally one clears up! I'm especially enthusiastic as I crank out three miles before hopping off and heading home. I chug a big bottle of water, shower, and watch  Chef's Table  on Netflix. The Christina Tosi episode leaves me with a newfound desire to become a pastry chef. 10 p.m. \u2014 Lie down in bed and meditate for 10 minutes with the 10% Happier app. I know it's a horrible habit to be on my phone right before bed, but I just can't seem to quit it and spend 30 more minutes browsing Reddit before falling asleep. Daily Total: $0", "day_two": "Day Two: 7:05 a.m. \u2014 My alarm goes off and my arm shoots out to turn it off before it wakes up my roommate. I lie in bed for a few more minutes, totally content, before springing up to get my day started. Settle in downstairs with my usual cup of tea and the news. Advertisement 9:30 a.m. \u2014 Today is bagel day at our office! Technically we always have bags of bagels on hand in the kitchen, but on Wednesdays we get a fresh order from the place next door. I help myself to a toasted plain bagel with a smoked salmon schmear. 12 p.m. \u2014 Lunch today is peppered ahi tuna with rice and saut\u00e9ed kale. Usually I grab lunch with my team, but I always take at least one day a week to eat alone for quality \u201cme time.\u201d I poke around the kitchen for dessert and come away with a few peanut butter cups to munch on at my desk. 2 p.m. \u2014 I get an email notification from Zara that a dress I want is finally back in stock! I mull over whether to buy it, since the dress is pricey, but ultimately decide to go for it because a) it's extremely cute, and b) if it goes out of stock again, it might not come back.  $75.84 4:45 p.m. \u2014 Wrap up a few last things at work before grabbing my stuff to head to BART. Our company doesn't have set work hours (I don't think most tech companies do), but I prefer to work on a pretty consistent schedule so that my day feels structured. 6 p.m. \u2014 Back home before I run out to the gym again. I clock in my standard three miles while bopping to Kendrick Lamar. The man won a Pulitzer! What can't he do? Hop in the shower once I get home and catch up on the YouTube channels I subscribe to while munching on Girl Scout cookies and a kale salad. (Life is about balance, right?) Advertisement 9:30 p.m. \u2014 My run totally wiped me out today. I lie on my bed with the intention of just resting for a minute, but immediately fall asleep. Daily Total: $75.84", "day_three": "Day Three: 7:05 a.m. \u2014 I'm feeling hungrier than usual, so I spread apple butter on toast to eat with my morning tea. I grew up on the east coast, where my mom consistently brought me to Amish farmer's markets to get apple butter (amongst other things), so now I always keep a jar of it on hand. 10 a.m. \u2014 Get into work a little later than usual today, because my first meeting isn't until 10 a.m. I swing by the kitchen to grab a coconut chocolate Rxbar before heading off to the meeting room. 12 p.m. \u2014 Grabbing lunch today with other ladies on the team. Today I get roasted mushrooms and carrots, brown rice pilaf, and Israeli couscous salad. I really appreciate that our office has such healthy and delicious options! Get back to my desk and spend 10 minutes reading Money Diaries before getting back to work. 2:30 p.m. \u2014 I'm in desperate need of new razors and there's a Walgreens next to my office, so I pop out for 10 minutes to pick some up. Use my store card and a coupon to save $4 on my purchase.  $4.50 6 p.m. \u2014 I run three more miles at the gym, followed by a class at Berkeley! I used to go to school here and am lucky that I live close enough to the university to occasionally drop in on classes that look interesting. Today, I attend a human rights lecture with my friend who will be graduating later this semester. We learn about how prevalent child sex trafficking is across the world, even right here in the Bay Area. The conversation is thought-provoking, and leaves me with a lot on my mind. Advertisement 9 p.m. \u2014 Friend from lecture comes over to chat and we hang out for a bit while eating donuts she made. Bid each other goodbye around 10, since I have work tomorrow. Daily Total: $4.50", "day_four": "Day Four: 7:05 a.m. \u2014 Wake up to a Mint notification that my paycheck has been deposited! I've already contributed to my investment accounts this month, so I take a chunk of my paycheck and make my monthly contribution to my house down payment savings account. I definitely want to buy a house some day and I know it's going to be exorbitantly expensive, so I'm working hard to prepare for it now! 9:30 a.m. \u2014 I feel like I've been eating too much sugar lately, so I switch things up and grab a plain cup of Greek yogurt for breakfast. Definitely not the most pleasant to eat without toppings, but I remind myself of the health benefits and get through it. 12 p.m. \u2014 Lunch with the team again today. The only other female engineer is out this week, so it's just me and the guys. It can be intimidating at times to be one of the only women (and the youngest engineer!), but I remind myself that I worked my ass off to get here and am just as competent as everyone else. 4:30 p.m. \u2014 I have one more thing left to do but can't muster the brain power to logic through this bug, so I tell myself I'll figure it out next week and grab my stuff to leave. Pop on a podcast and walk to BART. Advertisement 7 p.m. \u2014 I have time for a longer workout since it's Friday, so I head to the gym and run five miles at a slower pace. I definitely think exercising consistently has had an effect on me, because I'm able to get through the run semi-comfortably and my legs don't feel like goo afterwards. 8 p.m. \u2014 Race back home to shower before going to a dance showcase my friend is in! There are lots of hip hop dance troupes at Berkeley, and this is her first time doing anything like this, so I definitely want to go and support her. I cheer embarrassingly loud from the crowd as she gets on stage for her set. 10 p.m. \u2014 The showcase was amazing, but I'm exhausted and turn down my friends for drinks afterwards. Head home, change into my pajamas, and drink a cup of hot water with lemon before calling it quits and going to bed. Daily Total: $0", "day_five": "Day Five: 9 a.m. \u2014 I sleep in and then head downstairs to make a fried egg on sourdough toast and a cup of chamomile tea. 11 a.m. \u2014 Today is Berkeley's welcome celebration for admitted students, and the whole campus comes out for events and festivities throughout the day. My friends and I walk through all of the booths and stalls \u2014 it's really weird watching all of the incoming freshmen experience campus for the first time, and it makes us all nostalgic for our first years. We stop by a small Korean restaurant for lunch. I get a bowl with brown rice, tofu, greens, and teriyaki sauce \u2014 yum!  $7.59 Advertisement 3 p.m. \u2014 Back home after more campus exploration. I'm really sleepy for some reason and crawl into my bed to take a nap, but at the last minute feel bad about wasting time and potentially throwing off my sleep schedule. Get back up and head downstairs where I make tea and crack open a book. 5 p.m. \u2014 Gym time! I run another five miles at a slightly faster pace than yesterday, and my body feels weirdly amazing during and after. Is this what a runner's high is? 7 p.m. \u2014 I shower after I get back from the gym and tidy up the apartment a little bit. I don't normally get the chance to help out with chores during the week, so I try to do as much as possible to help my roommate out on weekends. 9 p.m. \u2014 Roommate comes back from her waitressing job and we get into a lengthy discussion about pie and cake. Both of us are absolutely obsessed with food, and we're always bouncing new recipe ideas off of one another. Daily Total: $7.59", "day_six": "Day Six: 8:45 a.m. \u2014 I meant to get up a little earlier to get ready before yoga, but I slept through my alarm. I jump straight out of bed, change into leggings and a tank top, and run out to my class. Make it to the session just as they're about to start, and thankfully they have snacks and water! Grab a Larabar before settling onto a mat and moving into child's pose. Advertisement 10:15 a.m. \u2014 Yoga was great! I don't go regularly because I usually run, but today's class has made me reconsider my stance. I feel so relaxed, loose, and comfortable in my own body. After yoga, I go to the Target downtown to pick up almond milk, plus a sandwich at the shop next door to eat later for lunch.  $10.87 12 p.m. \u2014 Once I finish up lunch at home, I decide to take on a task I've been avoiding for the last week or so: laundry. I grab my bag of dirty clothes from upstairs and schlep it down to the basement where the machines in our buildings are. I know I'm an adult, but it still scares the crap out of me to be down here alone. Throw my clothes in and swipe my card to pay before sprinting back up the stairs to safety.  $4 4 p.m. \u2014 Today really is a lazy Sunday. I fold my laundry and put it away, and then spend the rest of the afternoon whipping up a batch of fresh cinnamon rolls out of pure boredom. 7 p.m. \u2014 Watch a few episodes of  Queer Eye  on Netflix before calling it a night and going to sleep.

Mull over color options for a few minutes before purchasing one I like.  $6.50 Advertisement 12 p.m. \u2014 Lunch with the team again. We get into a discussion about the pros and cons of attending Burning Man and the different things people have built/set up over the years there. Some of my teammates have actually gone before (and I've never been), so I'm fascinated by the things they've done there. 5 p.m. \u2014 Chug through a couple more bugs and a meeting at work before packing up my stuff to head home. My guilty pleasure is listening to Dave Ramsey's podcast on the walk to the train station, but it can get repetitive after a while. 6 p.m. \u2014 Today is my rest day, so I don't go for a run and instead make a kale salad for dinner while watching another episode of  Chef's Table  on Netflix.

The woman deserves an island, and I can only afford, like, a candle. 4:30 p.m. \u2014 Some cousins are coming over to check out our new apartment, so hubs and I head home and my mother-in-law sends us off with cake.

Hubby kicks me out of the bed instead of snuggling, and I am low-key annoyed. I want nothing more than to run under a hot shower, but there is just no time. I remember that my boss is not in today and my other two bosses usually stroll in the office at 10 a.m., so it's okay if I'm just a little late. I do my usual morning routine of moisturizing, makeup, and getting breakfast and lunch together. I hate leaving A. with no food, but homeboy is just going to have to figure it out. Advertisement 8:19 a.m. \u2014 I miss my train and the next one doesn't come for 30 minutes (something I am not used to as a New Yorker), so I have to take the bus, which I hate. I get nauseous and it takes forever. 9:10 a.m. \u2014 I'm in the office. It's been quiet lately and almost everyone is out, so I use the time to send thank you messages and order a gift certificate to the spa for my mommy. I also use the time to look at dresses for my brother's wedding in the fall, along with plane tickets for the summer (we're planning a vacation to Greece and Croatia) and plane tickets to NY for the wedding.  $119.24 12:30 p.m. \u2014 My coworker asks if I want to grab lunch, but I brought food from home. I also just don't feel like making awkward small talk, so we \u201cplan\u201d for another day. I step out of the office to buy sweet potatoes and cinnamon strudel. I avoid cooking on Fridays (my day off), but we have food at home, so I plan to quickly roast sweet potatoes and regular potatoes for dinner.  $6 6:30 p.m. \u2014 I'm home and A. is at the gym. I put the potatoes in the oven for dinner. I would love nothing more than to go out to dinner tonight, but I'm #BallinOnABudget. I finish up watching  Money Heist  and I tell A. what he missed when he comes home. Now he wants to watch, so I watch the last two episodes again.

A. has been feeling down in the dumps lately due to being unemployed and some family issues, so he heads out to the gym with friends. I enjoy my alone time. (I can be very introverted.) I jump in the shower, shave, put on makeup, get laundry going, and start to iron clothing. I text my brother to buy a card for our mom for Mother's Day and ask him to insert the gift certificate in the card. It's 3:30 a.m. on that side of the world, but he'll see it when he wakes up. 11:15 a.m. \u2014 I notice we're almost out of groceries and Ramadan is approaching, so A. and I run out to Aldi to get some essentials, since we're both going to fast. We're trying to figure out the meat situation in our house. We're deciding between buying in bulk at Aldi (which we don't want to do because the quality is subpar, but it costs much less) or buying fresh every day (which we want to do, but it's pricier). Anyway, we buy a loaf of bread, wraps, eggs, broccoli, yogurt, various cheeses, juice, lemons, deli slices, potatoes, milch mause chocolates (so yum), cottage cheese, mayo, lemon juice, apple sauce, blueberries, razors, shaving cream, salt, vinegar, nuts, and chicken cutlets (though I don't get too many, because with Ramadan coming up we want to stick to halal meat).  $117.01 Advertisement 1 p.m. \u2014 We then go to our local supermarket and buy two packs of water and ground beef for moussaka tonight.  $8.86 1:30 p.m. \u2014 My husband brings the groceries up and I put them away. Then I get started on making dinner, because we're hangry. 2:15 p.m. \u2014 A. would like to help with dinner, so I ask him to cut the potatoes on the mandoline slicer and tell him 505 times to watch his fingers \u2014 and what does he do?! Almost slices his damn finger off. I'm a fainter when I see blood, but there is just no time for that. I clean up his wound with hydrogen peroxide and he's in one piece. I continue with the food and turn on the TV to  Wendy Williams.  A. goes down for a nap. 4 p.m. \u2014 Dinner is ready. When we're done, a friend of ours calls to meet up \u2014 his girlfriend, who lives in Switzerland, is in town, and she's so lovely. We get ready, and then they pick us up in said girlfriend's convertible. So amazing. We drive around, go to a carnival, and then get drinks at a caf\u00e9. They graciously pay. I make a mental note to always keep hair ties in the car if A. and I ever have a convertible. 10:30 p.m. \u2014 We're finally home, and we're exhausted.

We have friends coming around 1 p.m., so I peel myself from bed, get in the shower, and then tidy up.

I put all my emotions into ironing until our guests arrive, and then I just suck it up and put on a front. 4:30 p.m. \u2014 Our guests leave.

But she thinks she has some authority over me for some reason? I don't know what world she lives in and how she made it to 2018. I can't complain, because I need my job at this moment.

My hotel has a concierge lounge for guests with status, so I grabbed a bunch of fruit last night before leaving to meet my boyfriend. I get dressed, and then eat some of the fruit and a granola bar for breakfast. On my way to the office in my Uber, I dial into a call. Get to the office and immediately wish I was back in bed. ($19.40 expensed) Advertisement 10 a.m. \u2014 I take care of work travel logistics for my next two weeks. I manage to find two decently priced trips on my preferred airline (Delta, baby) and book them ($322 for each flight), plus a car for next week ($192 expensed) and hotels for both weeks ($1,400 expensed). I book the hotels using my personal credit card for the points and then get reimbursed, but pay for the others on the company card for liability and insurance purposes. These costs were shocking to me when I first started, but I have seen coworkers expense some fairly ridiculous amounts...flying to smaller cities is way more expensive, so I applaud myself for sticking to a $300ish flight budget. ($2,236 expensed) 11 a.m. \u2014 REGRETS. Immediately after booking my flights, my best friend from school texts asking me to visit her for the weekend soon. My company has a great travel policy where I can fly to another city besides my home city from my client city as long as the flight cost is equivalent to a usual trip home. I love my friends and miss them dearly. I debate canceling flights to see my best friend, but put it off for now because I made a pact to myself that I would stay in NYC more and get more value out of my rent. 12 p.m. \u2014 Lunchtime! Another salad today. I consider kombucha, but stick to water. I eat lunch alone at my desk...sadly a far more common occurrence than I would like. It's typically frowned upon in consulting to act nothing less than stressed 24/7, so most of my team eats while working. I browse through emails (work and personal) while I eat and see that a refund for Pacsun hit my account ($83.04 back!). ($7.95 expensed) Advertisement 2 p.m. \u2014 Feeling lonely. I am the youngest by a few years on my team, and the only woman most days. I message a coworker who started work around the same time as me, and we lament about the glass ceiling we all want to break and the numerous barriers (subtle and not-so-subtle). I drink coffee to calm myself down. 6 p.m. \u2014 Entertain the idea of leaving the office now and pretend to consider going to the gym. I usually try to go once or twice a week while traveling in Boston, but I have had no motivation lately. I do mindless work \u2014 set up meetings, clean out my inbox, and sign up for trainings \u2014 while listening to Taylor Swift and considering my options for dinner. 6:30 p.m. \u2014 Uber back to the hotel and graze on snacks for dinner. Call my parents, check my personal and work emails, talk to my boyfriend, check in with my sister, and start making plans for the weekend. Traveling is quite lonely, and this is a fairly typical night for me. C'est la vie! I continue to read and then decide to push off packing for my flight until the morning. ($19.48 expensed) 11 p.m. \u2014 I sign up for a 6 a.m. conditioning class tomorrow, which I input into my work calendar so no one calls me during that time, and then fall asleep at 11 p.m. Promptly wake up a few hours later at 4 a.m., cancel the 6 a.m. class in a haze, and fall back asleep. A+ for effort. Advertisement Daily Total: $0", "day_four": "Day Four: 8:30 a.m. \u2014 Oh no. I overslept!! I make like the Tasmanian Devil and get dressed and pack in an instant. I have so many things with me after being on the road for two weeks straight and in Texas for a weekend, so I stuff things into my suitcase and pray it doesn't rip more than it already has. I dial into a call and listen while scarfing down a granola bar and making sure I have all my stuff. I check out of my hotel and tell everyone I'll see them again in three days. (At this point, I am pushing for a hotel room to be named after me.) A coworker texts me to say that the head of the project praised me at a dinner last night, and I smile. After yesterday, this is the push I needed to keep going. 9 a.m. \u2014 Uber to the office with my suitcase in tow. Barrel up the stairs and try not to collapse once I get to my seat. Work work work until lunch! Hoping to switch onto the earlier flight today. ($22.96 expensed) 12 p.m. \u2014 Another salad! Work through lunch again. Get a text from LOFT that my in-store pickup is ready. I ordered a skirt and chose to pick it up to avoid paying shipping. (I'll pay for it when I pick it up.) It arrived earlier than I expected, though, and there's no way I can get it today before flying home. I call the store to see if my boyfriend can pick it up...but sadly they require a photo ID, and there's no way he can pass for me! I make a note to pick it up when I'm here next. ($9.98 expensed) Advertisement 2:30 p.m. \u2014 Oh my goodness...this meeting is never-ending. It's a really important one because we're announcing several big changes to an upcoming program. I helped to devise part of the communication, so I was excited to see how people reacted. People are unhappy about it, but I listen to my boss do her thing and talk them into agreement. 3 p.m. \u2014 My boss and I pack up our stuff and she offers me a ride to the airport, which means I don't have to Uber! We get stuck in traffic and chat about our lives. I double-check my 7 a.m. yoga class for tomorrow and check my flight status. 4:30 p.m. \u2014 Success! Make it off standby for the earlier flight back home. Get on the plane, continue to monitor work emails, and immediately pass out once the plane takes off. It's a quick journey back to NYC. 6:30 p.m. \u2014 HOME!!!! Oh my gosh...the line for cabs is brutal at JFK, and of course there's no cell service to call an Uber. I finally get a cab and share it with three women in line who are visiting from the South. I offer them recommendations for things to do over the weekend and cover the cost of the cab for all of us since it's expensed. ($85 expensed) 8 p.m. \u2014 My bed feels amazing. I am so happy. I unpack a little and scrounge around for something to eat. One of the downsides of traveling is that I have no reason to grocery shop anymore, and instead keep a bunch of dry and frozen foods on hand. I miss grocery shopping and cooking because it relaxes me and makes me feel like I have a routine. I eat what rice pudding and vegetable dumplings (Costco is bae), and then watch TV. I debate meeting up with friends tonight, but I am too comfy at home to leave. Advertisement 8:45 p.m. \u2014 Run downstairs to get my eyebrows threaded before the place closes. After they're done, I feel like a new person, and internally wink *lookin' good, good lookin'* to my reflection in the mirror. I send snaps of my new brows to my Snapchat Best Friends and catch up on a week's worth of messages in my friend group's chat. I watch TV, put away clothes, catch up with my roommate when she gets home, and do a little work before passing out around 11.  $10.36 Daily Total: $10.36", "day_five": "Day Five: 6:30 a.m. \u2014 Time for yoga!! (Classes are included in my gym membership.) I am so proud of myself for being awake this early and going to the gym. I get dressed, notice that my hair needs to be washed, and head out. I am working from home this morning before heading to the office in the afternoon to see friends. 8 a.m. \u2014 Feeling like a workout goddess. Come home, sign onto my computer, and accidentally doze off while waiting for a call to start. Never fear, I wake up and eat another bowl of rice pudding while listening in to my call. I make plans for tonight with friends, then shower and continue to work on documents. 2 p.m. \u2014 I eat a random assortment of food in my fridge and get dressed to go into the office. On my walk to work, I run into Gap and find a soft black dress on sale! I buy it, because I can always use more black, and this weekend's weather is supposed to be really nice. I listen to music as I walk the rest of. the way. I smile at the sun shining down on me and look forward to catching up with friends at work.  $14.99 Advertisement 3 p.m. \u2014 I love seeing my work friends! I am so lucky to have found them \u2014 they have been fundamental in my adjustment to work, and they understand what I've been going through. I notice that most of my team has signed off for the evening, and take that as a sign to completely disconnect for the rest of the evening. I check my email constantly on Sundays through Thursdays and respond ASAP, but Fridays and Saturdays are mine. 4:30 p.m. \u2014 There's a networking event with free drinks and food in the office!! They're giving out free shirts and notebooks, so I grab one of each, a plate of mediocre (but free, so it's great) food, and half a glass of white wine. I got my period earlier today and my cramps are like actual internal warfare, so I take Midol. 6:30 p.m. \u2014 Walk home and talk to my boyfriend on the phone. His voice really calms me down, and I need it. Then I call my dad and we start arguing, which immediately ratchets up my anxiety. I really love my parents, but they haven't been adjusting well to empty nesting. The stress of needing to justify each weekend why I want to stay in my apartment instead of going home is getting hard. They've given me everything and I love them for it, but the guilt trips hurt because I do care about them. I hang up and feel a little melancholy. 8 p.m. \u2014 My boyfriend calls me as I'm laying in bed to tell me he hurt his back at the gym. I slipped a disc in my back during college, and I remember the sheer pain and discomfort, so I immediately worry. He says it's common for him so he knows how to deal with it, but he sounds really upset. I order him Vietnamese food from Seamless to have delivered to him. He's really happy and surprised, which makes me happy! I continue to lie in bed until my roommate comes home. We've made a pact to try more bars and hot spots in NYC while we still live here and can afford it. Tonight we decide to try The Campbell, a cool bar we heard about in Grand Central.  $14.58 Advertisement 9:30 p.m. \u2014 We're both dressed in all black and wearing similar makeup, which we jokingly call the \"NYC Uniform.\" We get to The Campbell and each order one drink. (WHY are drinks $20 in NYC?) I've been really proud of myself for limiting my drinking to the weekends and for not blacking out as regularly as I did in college (heh). We take artsy photos of our cocktails, discuss our respective relationships, and talk about our futures. I cover the bill ($50), but she immediately Venmos me her half.  $25 11:30 p.m. \u2014 We walk to a wine bar located near our apartment, but when we get there it's closed. We take that as a sign to go home. We want to get food, but the 99 cent pizza place is permanently closed, and we take that as a very strong sign to go home and go to bed. 12 a.m. \u2014 Home! I take my makeup off and then read in bed. My cramps are still bad, but I refuse to take anymore Midol tonight \u2014 last time I took it this late, I was the Energizer Bunny and stayed awake all night, much to the chagrin of my boyfriend. Lesson learned! Daily Total: $54.57", "day_six": "Day Six: 10 a.m. \u2014 Head to a pilates class (included with gym membership)! The class is great, and I feel pleasantly sore afterwards. I come home and get dressed while watching  Famous in Love . I'm meeting some friends from school and work at Smorgasburg, and I am excited to mix friend groups, albeit a little nervous! Advertisement 12 p.m. \u2014 I load my MetroCard with $10 and head over.  $10 1 p.m. \u2014 Meet up with my friends at Smorgasburg. My school friends are some of my favorite people and one of my biggest regrets about traveling is not seeing them enough. I can be myself around them and tell them anything, which makes them keepers in my book. My work friends are great, too, and they get along well with my school friends. We split up to get food \u2014 I get a vegan BBQ slider and a Goa Taco (so good) and then we all meet by the water to take pictures and eat. We all split chili-lime mangoes and make plans to come back soon. I spend $19 in total, which I count as money well spent.  $19 3 p.m. \u2014 We don't want this day to end. The weather is perfect, so we walk across the Williamsburg Bridge. 6 p.m. \u2014 I meet up with some other friends at a small tapas place in the East Village. We share a pitcher of sangria and talk about a whole bunch of nothing. I'm so grateful I've had so much friend time in the sun today! We move onto a bar called Bua, which is much more our vibe, and share two bottles of wine among the four of us. Disaster strikes momentarily as one of my friends spills red wine all over me, but luckily we clean it up fast. It does stain my scarf, which was a gift from an ex, so it's probably for the best! I cover the bill ($100 with tip) and everyone immediately Venmos me. I love doing this for the points and the ease of paying. Splitting at the table is confusing and stressful for us, plus the waitstaff!  $23.25 Advertisement 8 p.m. \u2014 Okay I am tipsy. I rush home to get dressed for a birthday party and sprint to the bus to head down to the bar where it is. I am very late. 10 p.m. \u2014 My friend's birthday is so much fun! She's so sweet, and it's great to see a bunch of school friends. I catch up with them for a while and we all scream-sing \"Happy Birthday\" to her when they bring out her cake. We take a bunch of silly Boomerangs for Instagram. 11 p.m. \u2014 I head to a pregame for my work friends! My friend bought a handle of vodka for us to split, so I Venmo her my portion, though I probably won't even drink it. I get to the party after responding to a bunch of texts asking where I am (being fashionably late is a lifestyle). We hang out on the rooftop of the apartment to appreciate the beautiful night. In classic NYC fashion, we don't leave for the bar until after midnight.  $6 12:30 a.m. \u2014 We finally get to the first bar, but it's not really our vibe \u2014 too many frat dude types and not enough dance floor. We move on to Los Feliz, which is a ton of fun! We all start dancing and I get gin and tonics for myself and my friend (because I owe her a drink). We dance until 4 a.m. and get increasingly sillier as the night progresses.  $25.04 4 a.m. \u2014 PIZZA TIME. My friend gets us an entire pie for the table to share and, oh my gosh, it tastes so good. Advertisement 5:30 a.m. \u2014 Home!!

I wake up and chug the water bottle I filled last night. Go into the kitchen and notice that I also spilled half a pitcher of water on the floor last night. At least it wasn't wine! Crawl back into bed and talk to my boyfriend to catch up on each other's respective nights. A friend from last night calls saying she doesn't remember much. Luckily (and surprisingly) I do, so I catch her up and then send her back to bed with the promise that I'll see her in a few hours for lunch. 11 a.m. \u2014 I get dressed and head to yoga, feeling like I may puke in downward dog. 12:30 p.m. \u2014 Yoga was weird. Not sure I liked this instructor much, but glad I went and moved around after a night of debauchery. Grab a salad from my favorite place. I'm meeting friends for lunch at 1:45, but I'm HANGRY. Get home and eat while posting an Instagram in honor of my anniversary with my boyfriend. Find cute pictures, throw on a cute caption, and watch the likes roll in.  $11.38 1:15 p.m. \u2014 I AM LATE. I frantically get dressed and pack a bag because I want to work in the sunshine after lunch. I wear the new black dress I got from Gap, run to the bus, and have to fill my MetroCard ($10) before getting on. Traffic is killer, and I roll into lunch 30 minutes late.  $10 Advertisement 3 p.m. \u2014 I get to the restaurant and everyone else has already ordered. I order spinach gnocchi in a pomodoro sauce. We all catch up on our nights and talk about how much fun we had. The gnocchi is just okay, but everyone else really likes it. Guess I'm just a harsh critic! We decide to hit up a sample sale after.  $25.50 5 p.m. \u2014 Eh. Sample sale is okay \u2014 not really my vibe, and I don't really need to be spending money. A group of us split off after shopping to get work done. We walk to my friend's place to grab his stuff and then spend the next hour looking around for a good place to work. We need outlets and wifi, which are surprisingly harder to find than I expected on a Sunday in NYC. We ultimately end up working at a Starbucks near my apartment. We stop for ice cream ($5) on the way. My heart is so full spending the day with these friends.  $5 7 p.m. \u2014 At Starbucks, I get string cheese and vanilla soy milk because I am a child. I take care of a lot of little work things, and then text my friend who is having surgery tomorrow and check in with another friend who was a little upset with me earlier.  $3.48 7:30 p.m. \u2014 While we're working, we get a text from our other friends saying they're at a bar right near us! We drop our stuff off at my apartment and walk over to say hi. We play a game of Uno with the biggest playing cards I have seen and hang out for a while. I feel my Sunday scaries setting in hardcore. Why does the weekend have to end?! 8 p.m. \u2014 My friends and I leave pretty soon after arriving to get back to my place and keep working. Then I pack for another week in Boston. After six months, I have finally figured out the formula for packing. My friends run out to get food and bring back lightbulbs for me that I requested, which I Venmo them for.  $4.99 9:30 p.m. \u2014 I place an order on Amazon using a gift card I got through work. I buy Biotin, rosehip oil, vitamin C serum, hangers, pads, an electric toothbrush, and an ice roller ($97). I've had these in my cart for a while and I finally pull the trigger using a gift card I have to cover all of it. 10:30 p.m. \u2014 My friends leave, and I'm sad to see them go. This was one of my favorite parts of college \u2014 always having people over and around, and I am still adjusting to this change post-graduation. I can't wait to own a house one day to throw dinner parties. I continue packing and talk to my boyfriend. It's a really emotionally heavy conversation, because we are still working through our issues, and I cry more than once. I really do love him, but I want us to both be happy, and we have changed so much since college. 12:30 a.m. \u2014 I have to be up at 5 for a 7 a.m. flight. I should be asleep, but instead I battle the Sunday scaries and check the Facebook event for my birthday pregame.

I ended up half walking and half jogging the four kilometers back to my car. I try not to beat myself up too much about it. I'm still recovering from a traumatic birth, and some days are going to be tougher than others. I drive home and make ham and veggie sandwiches on wheat bread for N. and me. 6 p.m. \u2014 After an afternoon of family time, the baby gets fed, bathed, and changed into his pajamas. N. reads to him from  The Hobbit  and puts him to bed while I take the dog for a walk and listen to the  True Crime Garage  podcast. 7:30 p.m. \u2014 I marinated chicken overnight, so I whip up a nice butter chicken sauce and simmer the whole thing. We eat it with brown rice and steamed broccoli and each have a glass of home-brew beer while watching a trashy reality cooking competition. We have a group chat with our friends who live out of town about the show, and it's always hilarious.

We share early morning feeding duties and I get to sleep in a bit. 10 a.m. \u2014 We have a lazy family morning drinking coffee and playing with the baby. I make oatmeal with a chopped up apple, almond butter, and cinnamon. N.'s paycheck comes in and we're pleasantly surprised to see it's a little higher than normal. His first commission has come through! We transfer some of it over to our savings and give ourselves each little extra spending money. 12 p.m. \u2014 Baby naps for longer than usual, so after N. leaves for work I read up on baby sleep techniques from a library book I checked out. I'm going back to work in a few months, and we need to start working on weaning off night feeds. That's the dream! I heat up a leftover burrito for lunch. Advertisement 1 p.m. \u2014 I go to the pharmacy to pick up my prescription ($14.51). I have major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety order and I've taken antidepressants for years to keep everything in balance. I'm happy prescriptions are generally very affordable in Australia.  $14.51 1:30 p.m. \u2014 I sunscreen up and do a five kilometer run along the ocean with the baby in the pram while listening to S omeone Knows Something . 2 p.m. \u2014 Finish my run and find enough coins in the nappy bag to buy a vanilla soft serve cone from an ice cream truck. I eat it, and then strap the baby in the carrier and wade into the water up to my knees. What an exquisite feeling after a run!  $2.33 6 p.m. \u2014 N. is home and we do the baby bedtime routine. One of the best parts of my day is reading to the baby before we put him in bed. A freshly bathed and pajama-ed cuddly baby is a wonderful thing. 7:30 p.m. \u2014 I take the dog for a walk around the neighborhood while listening to  Someone Knows Something . We eat leftover burritos with oven chips. N. is the oven chip master! We rent  Murder on the Orient Express  on the PlayStation Network and settle in for a movie night.  $4.62 11 p.m. \u2014 The movie isn't great but not terrible either. N. feeds the animals, and I feed the baby, do my skincare, and flop into bed. Daily Total: $21.46", "day_five": "Day Five: Advertisement 8:30 a.m. \u2014 It's the weekend! N. takes the morning baby shift and I sleep in. I was only up once in the night, which is always a good thing. 10 a.m. \u2014 I have a coffee while doing our weekly grocery oder. I make my meal plan and grocery list on Fridays and put in the order for pick up on Saturday afternoons. Shopping online saves me loads of time and pretty much eliminates any impulse buys. I put the order through on N.'s Acorn app; he gets 50 cents in his account for each order. It's not much, but at the end of the year it's an extra $26, so I'll take it.  $63.67 12 p.m. \u2014 It's torrentially raining with thunder, so today turns into a family hangout and deep cleaning day. The pup tolerates a shower while giving serious sad eyes. We tackle several loads of laundry and I make a batch of carrot cupcakes, since I'm having some girls over for a birthday tea tomorrow. 2:30 p.m. \u2014 The weather has cleared up, so I head out by myself for a run. I do eight kilometers on my favorite route by the ocean while listening to  Someone Knows Something. 3:30 p.m. \u2014 I feel phenomenal after my run. I really needed it. I get a text from the grocery store that my order is ready for pick-up, so I swing by the supermarket on the way home. We paid for the order this morning when the order went through. N. calls and lets me know that we're almost out of formula, so I pick up a tin as well. It's on sale too! I stop at the liquor store on my way out and pick up wine and beer.  $34.50 Advertisement 7 p.m. \u2014 We do the bedtime routine and put the baby to bed. I make a stir-fry with onion, carrots, red capsicum, broccoli, and egg in a spicy almond butter sauce over egg noodles. We eat this once a week; it's delicious. We settle in front of the TV with beers to watch AFL. 10:30 p.m. \u2014 I had a couple drinks, so to be on the safe side, I give the baby a bottle for his last feed instead of breastfeeding, do my skincare, and go to sleep. Daily Total: $98.17", "day_six": "Day Six: 7:30 a.m. \u2014 Wake up and have coffee with N. and the baby. I did the 2:30 a.m. feed and N. got up at 5:30 a.m. 9 a.m. \u2014 Shower, do my hair, dress, and start prepping food for my birthday tea. I bake scones, and make cream cheese icing for the carrot cupcakes, whip cream, and tea sandwiches (roast beef with horse radish, cream cheese with cucumber and goat cheese with pickled beetroot). I get the table set with my nice china and head upstairs to do my makeup. 11 a.m. \u2014 The girls arrive and give me a few lovely gifts. Unexpected but much appreciated! We pop open a bottle of champagne and toast to my birthday (which is really next week), then get down to eating, chatting, and cuddling the baby. 2 p.m. \u2014 The girls leave and the baby goes for a nap. My sister-in-law brought over four huge boxes of baby clothes that her son has outgrown. Almost all of the baby's clothes are hand-me-downs from friends and family, which has saved us a whole heap of money. Babies grow so quickly that all the clothes are in excellent condition, and in some cases brand new. N. and I spend the afternoon sorting through the clothes while watching more AFL. Advertisement 5 p.m. \u2014 I take the dog for a walk around the neighborhood while listening to  Someone Knows Something . It's a lovely warm evening. 7 p.m. \u2014 I feed and bathe the baby and read him  Harry Potter  while N. makes dinner. After the baby is settled in bed, we eat dinner. Tonight is steak with spinach, apple, walnut, and goat cheese salad in a mustard vinaigrette, with sweet potato mash and peas. It's all fantastic. 9 p.m. \u2014 Kitchen is cleaned and animals are fed, so we head up to bed and I do my skincare routine. It's now pouring (gotta love that dramatically changing Melbourne weather) and we lay in the dark listening to the rain and a  Harry Potter  audiobook and chatting. Baby has his 10:30 p.m. feed and then I crawl back into my nice warm bed. Daily Total: $0", "day_seven": "Day Seven: 7 a.m. \u2014 N. wakes me out of a deep sleep with a baby and a coffee. I didn't sleep well, so I'm struggling to open my eyes. 8 a.m. \u2014 I make another coffee and eat oatmeal with chopped up apple, almond butter, and cinnamon. We're nearly out of almond butter so I add it to my Costco list. We do a big Costco trip for things like nappies, wipes, non-perishables, and meats for the freezer at the start of each month, which is coming up next week. 10 a.m. \u2014 Baby naps, and I do some online window shopping. I'm on a reduced salary for my maternity leave, and we still want to save as much as we can, so we give ourselves a limited amount of \u201cfun\u201d money each month. I've become good at planning out and budgeting for my future purchases. We're going to Hawaii this summer for my dad's 70th birthday, and I need a new bathing suit. I'm also on the hunt for matching knit beanies for myself, N., and the baby (no shame, I'm a dork and I love it!), and black leather Chelsea boots. I shop vintage and thrift stores as much as possible, but some things just shouldn't be bought used! I find some good options and bookmark them for later. Advertisement 11 a.m. \u2014 Baby eats his lunch and I eat the last leftover burrito. We bundle up and head out to the zoo. We have an annual membership which gives us unlimited access to all three zoos in Victoria. We have a short but pleasant visit since it's chilly and windy and we're getting intermittent showers. 2 p.m. \u2014 Back home. I eat a toasted ham and veggie sandwich with a spinach, beetroot, and goat cheese salad. Baby takes another nap and I putter around tidying the house. 3 p.m. \u2014 I make a cup of tea and eat an unfrosted carrot cupcake while scrolling through social media and various shopping websites. Baby is the joy of my life and I like staying home with him, but I also can't wait to get back to my job, which I love, and a bigger paycheck, which I also love! 7 p.m. \u2014 N. does the bedtime routine and I take the dog for a walk while listening to  Someone Knows Something.  7:30 p.m. \u2014 Leftover steak, salad, and oven chips for dinner while watching garbage TV. I have a glass of white wine. We clean up, feed the animals, and go up to bed. Skincare done, baby gets a feed at 10:30, and I fall asleep.

I make sure I have my Metro card and a full water bottle and am out of the house within 20 minutes. I ride my bike to the train station, buy my ticket ($8) and am told it's delayed 10 more minutes. Blah. I waste my time on the train by listening to Release Radar and Discover Weekly on Spotify. ($8 expensed) 8:30 a.m. \u2014 I stop at my favorite French pastry shop to pick up a pain au chocolat.

I listen to more music on Spotify and feel sad that I don't have a romantic partner. I think I'm great and try to put myself out there, but it just doesn't pan out. I had two abusive ex-boyfriends that destroyed part of me and fueled negative thoughts about how I don't deserve to find love or be worthy of it.

Is that sad to say? I'd love to feel more excitement about everything at all times of the day, but I'm tired. Advertisement 5 p.m. \u2014 I leave work and walk 20 minutes to the nail salon. I had a shitty week because my sort of boyfriend (the fun in-between phase) ended things, so I want to find a small source of joy like getting pretty nails. My manicurist and I talk about food dishes we've been making recently and she infuses me with positive energy. While I'm getting my nails done, I miss two calls from my long distance BFFs.

I shower, take my son out to pee in the yard (he's a rescue dog I brought home about five years ago), and then hit the road. No coffee at home today because my work has a great coffee and snack selection. 10 a.m. \u2014 Clock into work and get down to learning the ins and outs of probate law. I'm replacing an attorney, so I have a lot to learn and very big shoes to fill. 4 p.m. \u2014 Head out for the day feeling overwhelmed but super happy.

I'm almost never hungry in the mornings, so I don't bring breakfast, but I grab a nutrition bar from the office whenever I get hungry. 12 p.m. \u2014 I leave the office to grab lunch.

I started school in August to finish my BA and have been super committed to my schoolwork, so they understand that I don't really go out during the weekdays, even if it's spring break. I feel like I'm very behind everyone because I have a three-year gap in my education, but I know it's all in my head and it's just me beating myself up for something I really had no control over (depression is the worst). I am now on Prozac and have done a lot of self-reflection in the years since my mental health crisis. I'm still working through the anger I feel at myself.

I send it in and let them know that I'm available to make edits if they need me to. Now it's time to get ready for work. On the way to the office, I stop and grab a bagel breakfast sandwich from one of my favorite spots called Kavarna. The people there are so nice, and they always have cool new art on the walls.  $5 5 p.m. \u2014 I go straight from the office to bed. I'm too exhausted for the gym. With two days in a row of no gym, I know I'm going to have to go tomorrow. I get up for a second to get my gym bag ready, put my clothes out, and wash my face. I end my nighttime routine with witch hazel toner and slather my face in Aquaphor. The weather in Atlanta has been so windy and cold these past few days. My skin has taken a beating, but Aquaphor helps me feel like I have a brand new face. I force my dog to cuddle with me and we both fall asleep immediately. Daily Total: $5", "day_five": "Day Five: 8:30 a.m. \u2014 It's Friday!!! I sleep in a bit later than usual to get my body back to full health. I spent my early 20s partying hard (which did not help my depression) and now I feel like my body is very susceptible to any changes in my schedule. It takes me a while to get back on track, but I feel a lot better after getting sleep. Advertisement 12 p.m. \u2014 The new boss takes us all out for lunch at this hip spot across the street called Leon's. It's really great food and we spend lunch talking about politics, gun control, dating, and my other coworker's wedding plans. The conversation is great, and I fall even more in love with my job. It took a couple months of applying and interviewing to find it and I'm so grateful every day that I did. 3:30 p.m. \u2014 I get out of work early with my first paycheck in hand. We get paid weekly and with a company check that we deposit ourselves. Thankfully, taxes are taken out of it already. I had a job a couple years ago that did not take taxes out and I am still paying it off. I have less than $1,000 to go! It's been really hard to be in school and keep up with my payments. Before this Atlanta job, my L.A. job barely covered all my expenses. I depended on my family a lot and have plans to pay them back in the future. I stop by Publix to grab a big bottle of wine to have a glass as I get ready for dinner with friends.  $12 6 p.m. \u2014 We go to a new Italian spot for dinner and laugh the night away. Because I spend so much time alone, I like to meet up with people at least once a week. I'm still trying to find a balance between being self-reliant and isolating myself. I hug everyone goodbye around 9 p.m. and head home to care for my dog-son who is up waiting for me. I sit on the front porch as he zigzags around the yard, loving his freedom. I chat with my roommates (I live with two guys my age) and then put on  Brooklyn Nine-Nine  in the background to fall asleep to.  $25 Advertisement Daily Total: $37", "day_six": "Day Six: 10 a.m. \u2014 I roll out of bed and get my workout clothes on. It's time to make up for lost time!! First things first, I head to the park near my place with my dog. I know it's not the best idea, but I never put him on a leash. I like to let him wander and he follows behind me at all times. We walk for a couple hours. I wave hi and say good morning to all the other walkers out there. I love how friendly Atlanta is. 1 p.m. \u2014 I drop off my dog at home and grab food to hold me over for a while before I go to the gym. I swipe into my university gym with my student ID and get to work. I stay longer than usual to make up for lost time and because I can feel my body is a little slower than it normally is. I listen to podcasts as I go through my workout. I have so many episodes to catch up on! 5 p.m. \u2014 I start to get ready for my friend's party tonight. I make dinner plans with another friend to hang out with before the party. We decide to meet at 7, which means I need to hop in the shower right away. I have so much hair that it takes me forever to wash and style it. 7 p.m. \u2014 My friend is late, so I order a beer and peruse the menu as I wait. Waiters take turns sitting with me because my friend is taking so long. I swear to them that I am not being stood up and that I do in fact have someone else arriving. Thirty minutes later, she shows up and I tell her about the whole debacle. We have a good laugh and catch up on old times. I haven't seen her in about a month because I just had midterms and hid myself for a while. She orders ceviche; I get tostones and a salad. It's all delicious. By the time we finish, my friends are blowing up my phone because it's almost 11 p.m. and they want me to hurry up and get to the party already. We pay separately.  $31 Advertisement 1 a.m. \u2014 We get to the party and immediately take jello shots. I talk to friends I haven't seen in a while and snuggle with the French bulldog my friend is dogsitting for the weekend. We decide to head out to nearby bars and grab a Lyft there. I buy a beer and talk to people. My ex and I broke up six months ago, so I'm trying to get back out there. I walk around looking for a cute guy to chat up. I like to just go up to guys and start talking \u2013 they're almost always happy I made the first move. On my way to talk to a guy, I'm sidelined by another guy who starts talking to me. We have a nice chat, but he's so obviously drunk that I start to feel uncomfortable. I excuse myself and head to the next bar with my friends.  $6 2 a.m. \u2014 My friends decide to head out, but I still want to see if I meet anyone. I stay behind with friends of a friend I don't know too well, but who are super nice. As I'm walking outside with them to the back porch, I meet a guy. He's super cute, so we chat for a while and really hit it off. He offers to buy me a drink, so I head into the bar with him. He buys me a beer and he buys himself a beer and a shot. He takes the shot of whiskey like it's nothing. (Am I just old?? I can't take shots like that anymore.) He invites me home and I say yes. Advertisement 3 a.m. \u2014 He pays for our Lyft to his place and we talk to the driver the whole way there. She's hilarious and can tell what we're up to for the night. We get to his place (and it's a beautiful apartment that he lives in alone \u2013 did I mention he's a corporate lawyer? I think I chose the wrong kind of law to practice) and get down to business, but either because he's drunk or just dumb, he doesn't want to use a condom. I immediately put an end to it and rip into him about this. He accepts my lecture and tells me I'm completely right about being annoyed with him. Placated, we cuddle and go to bed.

I tell him I need to get home to take care of my dog, and he offers to drive me home even though I'm a good 30 minutes away from him. Worried he might still be buzzed or drunk, I tell him he's sweet but that I'll grab a Lyft ($13). We make plans to hang out later in the week.  $13 9 a.m. \u2014 Finally home!

I put water by my bed for when I wake up and don't open my eyes again until 2 p.m. Advertisement 5 p.m. \u2014 After lounging about in bed for a few hours, I finally get up and make pasta with chicken and veggies.

Reformer is expensive AF, but I use ClassPass, so it's covered. Pretty much every workout class in LA is $28 (lol wut), which makes a ClassPass subscription a no-brainer. 7 a.m. \u2014 There's a Starbucks next door and I *did* wake up at 5:15 a.m. to get to this class on time, so I stop in for a venti blonde latte with coconut milk. I hoard Starbucks gift cards for situations like this, so my latte is covered. I also have a free coffee on my rewards app, but I like to save those for days when I'm feeling especially broke and desperate for a treat. I take my Starbucks home to quickly shower and watch last night's episode of  Last Week Tonight  while I get dressed. 8:30 a.m. \u2014 I stop for gas on the way to work and then call my mom. My mom and I are super close and talk every morning while I drive to work. I'm from the East Coast and don't see my family often, so it's nice to have a set routine to keep in touch.  $30 9 a.m. \u2014 I make a bowl of oatmeal and hurriedly try to eat it. I'm in a video shoot for most of today, so I'm trying to knock out all of my emails before I'm totally unavailable for four hours. 10 a.m. \u2014 Video time! We hired an outside videographer to knock out a few training and marketing videos with our CEO. If I'm being totally candid here, I'm super grateful for this shoot. This guy I've hooked up with a few times is randomly my company's client now. He's coming into the office during the shoot, and I'm glad I have somewhere to hide. (And if you're this dude reading my Money Diary: Hi. Sorry we haven't talked. I miss your dog.) Advertisement 2 p.m. \u2014 PLOT TWIST. The guy sends his business partners to the meeting instead, so he isn't coming in after all. Phew. I feel way less stressed now. We're done with our video shoot, too, so I heat up leftover broccoli/cauliflower casserole for lunch. 5:30 p.m. \u2014 I have to go straight to West L.A. for a meeting after work, so I swing by Taco Bell to pick up dinner. I fucking LOVE Taco Bell. It's the most vegan-friendly fast food restaurant (I'm vegan) and I could bathe in their Mild Sauce. I get two spicy potato tacos with added beans and a bean burrito. I order both Fresco-style, which basically just means \"vegan with added salsa.\"  $6 6:30 p.m. \u2014 Meeting time! I'm on the Associate Board of a nonprofit that serves L.A.'s homeless population and we have monthly meetings to talk about L.A.'s homelessness issues and plan projects. We're in the process of planning new project pitches right now (say that five times fast...), so this meeting is a mix of roundtable discussion and brainstorming in groups. The meeting ends around 9, and then I head home to curl up with a book and go to sleep. Daily Total: $36", "day_two": "Day Two: 8 a.m. \u2014 Why am I so tired again?!?! I seriously never get coffee this often, but I'm half asleep today. I grab another venti blonde latte with coconut milk from Starbucks on the way to work. I miraculously still have about $10 left on my Starbucks card. Dope. Advertisement 9 a.m. \u2014 In order to have time for Starbucks, I had to forego the usual oatmeal today, instead grabbing an avocado and two pieces of Ezekiel bread on the way out the door this morning. I turn it into avocado toast once I'm at work and top it with leftover Mild sauce packets from last night's Taco Bell. So millennial. 11 a.m. \u2014 My best friend and I go to Barry's Bootcamp class almost every Tuesday (butt and leg day!), but she has to bail this week, so we look for a class to take together Thursday. I'm pretty sure I'd snap in half if I did more than one Barry's in a week, so we sign up for a \"Drag Ride\" at Flywheel West Hollywood. I pray \"Drag\" means Drag Queen-themed, but I don't get my hopes up. Class is covered by ClassPass. 1 p.m. \u2014 One of my favorite coworkers works remotely in the Pacific Northwest, but she's in town this week! We head to a poke place that has tofu and grab poke bowls. Mine is $8 and some change, but I use the Digit app, so all of my purchases are rounded up, with the change heading into my savings account.  $9 1:40 p.m. \u2014 I almost never take lunch breaks, so I'm giving myself a little bit of extra time today. My coworker and I head to Daiso to look around. I almost buy a bunny-themed yoga mat, but resist the urge. Next, we head to a boba shop that's so ridiculous, it's been featured in those Business Insider videos that are always all over your Facebook newsfeed. We both get colorful boba drinks topped with cotton candy.  $6 Advertisement 7 p.m. \u2014 After work, I hustle home to get changed into workout clothes and then I head to Barry's Bootcamp. I am obsessed with this place. It's one of the only workout classes where I consistently question if I'm going to make it to the end, and I love feeling like my ass has been kicked. Class today is no exception, and I leave with legs so wobbly, I have trouble using the parking garage's escalator. I used ClassPass for today's class, so it's covered. 8:30 p.m. \u2014 Once I'm home, I'm too tired to make anything fancy for dinner, so I heat up a can of black beans and top it with slices of avocado. It's okay, not great. I finish it quickly, take a shower, smoke weed, and then read my book before falling asleep. Daily Total: $15", "day_three": "Day Three: 8 a.m. \u2014 I make a protein smoothie with Vega One, spinach, and fruit for breakfast. Vega One is crazy expensive, so I try to stock up whenever Whole Foods or Sprouts is having a sale. 11:30 a.m. \u2014 The coworker I went to lunch with yesterday brought treats for our weekly Sales and Marketing meeting. Oh man. She made us paleo-vegan raw brownies (YUM) and also brought vegan Smore's Girl Scout cookies. Score! 1 p.m. \u2014 Um...so my CEO just gave me a $100 Amazon Gift Card as a thank you gift for working hard. This is very out of the ordinary and a complete surprise. But I'll take it!

It's cancelled last minute, though, which means tonight, I'm free! I swing by Sprouts on the way home to pick up gluten-free linguine, pine nuts, and garlic for a pesto pasta recipe I'm making for dinner. I'm seriously craving chocolate, so I grab an Unreal peanut butter cup while I'm in line at checkout.  $22 7 p.m. \u2014 Dinner is the gluten-free pasta with a spinach-based pesto sauce. I use a Minimalist Baker recipe as a guide, but mostly wing it by adding toasted pine nuts and pomodoro-style cherry tomatoes. Wowwww, it's good. I pack up the other half for lunch tomorrow and totally forget about my peanut butter cup, opting for a few Thin Mints from the freezer instead. 9:30 p.m. \u2014 I connect my living room's Roku to an ex-boyfriend's cable info to get MTV (oops) and watch a few episodes of  The Challenge  before heading to bed with a book.

I take advantage of a rare weekday morning off and go to yoga with my best friend. My roommate actually teaches at a nearby studio, and she hooks us up with a free class. 9:30 a.m. \u2014 We shower at the studio and head next door to a new coffee shop with my roommate. One of our friends just went on a date from hell with a guy who pretended to dine-and-dash on their date (WTF?!), so we talk shit about LA's dating climate while sipping on Americanos.  $5 Advertisement 10:30 a.m. \u2014 I swing by my house and make cinnamon-sugar toast for breakfast. (Two pieces of toast with Follow Your Heart \"butter\" and a sprinkling of raw cane sugar and cinnamon.) I'm heading to my best friend's house for a bit to hang before my spin class later, so I grab workout clothes, too. 1 p.m. \u2014 I head to my best friend's house with my Tupperware of pasta from last night. I have keys to her place, too, so I let myself in and find her fully focused on Fallout 4 in the living room. She lives with her husband, and there are like six of us who are there often enough to have our own keys. We joke that their guest bedroom is where we all live. She's been wanting to get me into Fallout 4, so she sets up a profile for me before taking her cats to their vet appointment. By the time she comes home, I'm obsessed with this game, so we play for a few more hours before I have spin. 6:30 p.m. \u2014 I get to spin class and it's in one of the areas of WeHo where parking is either nonexistent or a million dollars, but this studio has free parking. THANK GOD. As a child, I never understood why the Free Parking space on a Monopoly board was a big deal. As an adult in L.A., it makes total sense. I walk into the studio and my suspicions were correct! It's a Drag Queen spin class led by a Flywheel instructor and a drag queen in full drag. I'm so excited. We pedal to remixes of Whitney Houston and the entire RuPaul musical anthology, and by the end of class, I'm totally wiped. Flywheel is competitive, so your power and RPM give you points. At the end of the class, I'm in second place for the women's side, which isn't bad considering this is my first Flywheel class ever and second workout of the day! Advertisement 8 p.m. \u2014 I try to resist going to Taco Bell again...but I just can't. I get a veganized Crunch wrap, pinto beans, and a potato taco. It's raining out, so I eat my TB all snuggled up on my couch.  $8 Daily Total: $13", "day_five": "Day Five: 8:45 a.m. \u2014 I'm starting a doctoral program next year and I'm currently deciding between two schools. Today is an admitted student event at one of them, so I head to the campus bright and early. At the parking kiosk where I'm supposed to pick up my parking pass for the day, I accidentally tell the parking attendant that I'm here for the  other  school's admitted student's day. So yeah...today's going well... 9 a.m. \u2014 Oh, thank god. They have coffee and bagels at this event. I'm fully booked for a day of class visits, panels, and more, so I'm going to need all the help I can get. 1 p.m. \u2014 After a morning full of info, we head to a faculty luncheon. It's been gross and rainy in L.A. for the past few days, but the sun is back! I kind of wish we could stay outside for a bit, but we head into a super nice building where I have a veggie wrap, salad, and fruit. We spend lunch asking our table's faculty member and current student a million questions about the school and the doctoral program. 4 p.m. \u2014 I leave the campus and can't stop thinking about ice cream. Traffic on the way home is unbearable, but when I get off the freeway, I swing by the Ralph's near my house and grab two pints of Halo Top's new Dairy-Free ice cream. Why is Halo Top so expensive?!  $11 Advertisement 6 p.m. \u2014 A bunch of us were supposed to go see a movie tonight, but the group chat is getting crazy and nobody is taking the lead on planning. Eventually, we all give up on movie night and decide to go out in Los Feliz instead. My best friend who did yoga with me yesterday can't come out, but my other best friend is still down! We make plans to meet up at a guy friend's house in a few hours. I order a burger and fries from Veggie Grill for dinner and start spraying a thousand pounds of dry shampoo in my hair so I can avoid taking a shower.  $14 9 p.m. \u2014 I get to my friend's house and he doesn't have any alcohol. My best friend and I decide to split a bottle of tequila, so we swing by Gelson's and pick up a bottle of Jose Cuervo (bleh), a six-pack of San Pellegrino, and a pack of gum. We go halfsies.  $14 11 p.m. \u2014 Our group for the night is seven people, so I grab a group and call a Lyft to head to a tiki bar in Los Feliz.  $6 11:15 p.m. \u2014 Drinks at this bar come in kitschy tiki mugs and I can't resist one. I order for the group so we don't have to wait in line at the bar for too long, and people promptly Venmo me back, which is surprising. My portion of the bill is $13. I had two drinks at my friend's house, and I'm somehow already pretty buzzed, so this is likely going to be my one and only drink. Why am I such a lightweight?  $13 Advertisement 1 a.m. \u2014 One of my friends gets half of us an Uber back to his place and a freaking Tesla comes to pick us up. This is really dope, I'm not going to lie. We all head back to his place, where I fall asleep in his room. Everybody else hangs out in the living room playing NFL Blitz.

Why did nobody just go home? I don't want to wake up my best friend, who's next to me, so I head into my friend's living room and pick up his copy of  Ready Player One . After a while, everybody wakes up. My guy friend says I can borrow his copy, which is a major score because it's been sitting in my Amazon shopping cart for weeks. 9 a.m. \u2014 My best friend and I walk to a vegetarian restaurant down the street and get breakfast sandwiches. I get a kombucha, too. She doesn't have plans until 2 or so, and I'm free all day, so we plan to head back to her place to lay out by the pool.  $14 10 a.m. \u2014 We get to my friend's house, and she makes me a piece of toast with peanut butter because apparently I kept saying I wanted that last night? How was I so drunk after drinking so little over the course of three hours? I eat my toast while we hike around her neighborhood. She lives in the hills near the Hollywood sign, so the views near her house are insane. Advertisement 11 a.m. \u2014 I get a notification from Postmates that they're waiving delivery fees, so I order a vegan buffalo chicken pizza from a pizzeria nearby before throwing on a bikini and heading to my friend's pool to lay out.  $24 12:10 p.m. \u2014 PIZZA'S HERE. PIZZA'S HERE. PIZZA'S HERE. My friend and I split the pizza while watching  The Pagemaster . Like the 90s movie about libraries. Talk about a throwback. 12:30 p.m. \u2014 As we're watching the movie, I remember my phone charger is on its last leg. I hop on the Amazon app and order the charger, a vegan cookbook I've been wanting, and a $5 prop I need for a costume party next weekend. It's not until after I've checked out that I remember I have a $100 gift card at home. Dammit.  $31 2 p.m. \u2014 I get home and put the gift card to use. I hop on Prime Now and order $72 worth of groceries, all covered by the card. I usually would just go to Sprouts or Trader Joe's, but this is free money and if I can save cash on groceries, I'm going to do that. Amazon won't let you use a gift card for tip, so I pay the suggested $7. I get cauliflower, spinach, tomatoes, grape tomatoes, kalamata olives, oatmeal, sweet potatoes, red potatoes, two onions, olive oil, cashews, raisins, peanut butter, a few cartons of almond milk, a six-pack of La Croix, and a few other items. I grocery shop based on meal and snack plans, so this is enough for the meals I've planned this week.  $7 Advertisement 4:30 p.m. \u2014 My groceries arrive and I toss the sweet potatoes in the oven to make a couscous salad with Israeli couscous, sweet potato, dried cranberries, slivered almonds, and a lime and olive oil dressing. Every time I make this salad, I eat the whole thing in one sitting, but this time I manage to save some for later. I watch a little TV and then head to bed.

I pop bread in the oven and make cinnamon-sugar toast to snack on while I get dressed. 9:45 a.m. \u2014 Lucky for me, the Pop studio is just down the street, so my slow-moving butt still makes it with minutes to spare. Honestly, my heart's just not in it today, but I used valuable ClassPass credits on this, so I'll be damned if I miss a class. 6 p.m. \u2014 I like to use Sundays to cook more labor-intensive meals. Tonight, I'm making a curry that has at least 14 different ingredients. It takes me over an hour, but it's one of my favorites and totally worth it. I pack up most of it to use for lunches throughout the week. 7:40 p.m. \u2014 As I was cooking dinner, I got a text from friends asking if I wanted to see a movie at 8:15. I'm always down for movies, as they're free with my MoviePass. I budget a little extra time to swing by a gas station on the way, but I hate feeling like I'm running late, so I just get $15 worth before continuing on my way.  $15 Advertisement 8:15 p.m. \u2014 I was the first to the theater by a long shot, but we all make it inside in time.

I wash my face and change into my gym clothes so I can head straight there after drop off. 9 a.m. \u2014 Back from the gym, showered, and ready to work. My company is amazing, and I get to work from home one day a week, so I always pick Tuesdays. I have a few errands to run, so this works out perfectly. 11:30 a.m. \u2014 I head to the post office to mail a package to New York. An influencer who I admire is letting me send her a copy of my book, and I'm ecstatic. I want to get it sent off right away ($6.70). On my way home, I stop by Dunkin' Donuts and grab an iced coffee, a breakfast sandwich, and hash browns ($7.50).  $14.20 3 p.m. \u2014 I haven't been productive at all, which is what happens all too often when I work from home. Luckily I got ahead on my work yesterday, so it's okay I took it slow. I peruse the ASOS website for work-appropriate summer wear, but can't commit to anything. Time to pick up the little sister from school! 5 p.m. \u2014 Done working for the day, and decide to eat a snack. I munch on almonds and string cheese while I decide what to cook for dinner.

I'm not particularly good at cooking, so I always stick to simple meals! 9 p.m. \u2014 Bedtime! I may be 22, but I'm not one to stay up late. I have a strict routine I follow, so that I'm always in bed my 9 p.m. and asleep by 11. I watch this week's episode of  Silicon Valley  (just caught up and I'm in love). 10 p.m. \u2014 Time to turn off the tech. I set my alarm for the morning and put my phone away. I try not to look at screens an hour before bed. I've always had bad insomnia, but this slight change has worked wonders. I pull out the book I'm reading,  The Female Persuasion , and read 30 pages.

I have a few in rotation, and this week I'm working my way through the first season of  Startup  from Gimlet Media. I want to host a podcast, so I listen to as many as I can!

I packed a Greek salad for my lunch, which I made in bulk earlier in the week, but I'm not a huge fan of it. I also just read an article about why I shouldn't eat romaine, so I'm trying to just finish it up. 4 p.m. \u2014 Freedom! My work hours are 9 a.m. to 4 p.m., which is truly amazing, and means I get to skip the worst of the traffic. I'm home in 40 minutes rather than the hour-and-a-half it would take if I left at 5! 5 p.m. \u2014 Quick Amazon order: two sets of headphones, headphone splitters, and a microphone. My sister and I are starting an indie podcast because we think we're funny (I'm sure no one else will) and because we spend way too much time talking about conspiracy theories.  $95 6 p.m. \u2014 I spend an hour designing us a very tacky logo that includes the outline of Guy Fieri's hair and race car flames, and thinking of social media handles. We talk through podcast episode ideas, but I start to get hungry, so we put the planning on hold. 7 p.m. \u2014 I fry up tofu with broccoli and cauliflower to make a quick stir-fry and call it a day. 9 p.m. \u2014 I spent the last two hours playing video games with my little sister. Was anybody else obsessed with  Kingdom Hearts  as a child, or just me? I introduced her to it, and she's as hooked as I was growing up. We played through a few levels, but now it's both of our bedtimes! Advertisement 9:30 p.m. \u2014 I watch an episode of  Champions .

I love this podcast, but I have to listen to it in the morning, or else I'll have nightmares. They keep mentioning a book called  I'll Be Gone in the Dark , so I make a mental note to pick it up over the weekend to read. I love reading true crime books, but I get through them so slowly because they keep me up at night. 11:30 a.m. \u2014 I forgot to pack my lunch, but I think it's because I subconsciously didn't want to eat my boring salad. I drive over to a local Thai place and order stir-fried veggies and rice. I feel sluggish when I head back to work.  $8.75 2 p.m. \u2014 The day is going by so slowly. I once again find myself on ASOS deciding if I should buy a few pieces for my trip to New York in a few weeks. I look through my saved items, but still don't feel ready to take the plunge. I decide to wait until my next paycheck and order two-day delivery so I can still get the clothes in time! Advertisement 4 p.m. \u2014 Time to go home. I listen to another podcast called  Yeah, But Still . This is the one I pay for on Patreon. The hosts are so funny and always make me laugh. Ever since I moved back to Dallas a few months ago, I've been missing the sense of humor my NYC friends have, and this podcast reminds me of them! 6 p.m. \u2014 Dinnertime! I poach an egg and cook up asparagus and mushrooms again. 6:30 p.m. \u2014 Tomorrow is Friday the 13th, so my sister and I drive down to a tattoo shop to sign up for a $20 tattoo. I decide to get a little pear, since I'm slowly working on covering my arm with plants and fruits!  $20 7:30 p.m. \u2014 We make a spur of the moment decision to go watch  A Quiet Place , and I grab tickets for both of us. I'm not one for horror movies, but the reviews on this one are too good to pass up. I walk out thoroughly impressed and teary-eyed!  $28 10 p.m. \u2014 Home and in bed.

I've been lacking a news outlet that doesn't make me sad, but finally found one that shows both conservative and liberal standpoints without being negative!

I get a cold brew with coconut milk for myself and a flat white for a coworker!  $8 11:30 a.m. \u2014 Time to go get my tattoo. The shop is right by my work, so I walk over. It only about five minutes. I slip the artist a $5 tip because I know he is crazy busy.  $5 4 p.m. \u2014 I leave work, and I'm starving. I blast the new Saba album on my way home and drive with my windows down, enjoying the warm Texas weather. The best thing about living in the South is that my seasonal affective disorder doesn't hang around throughout the spring like it did in New York! 5 p.m. \u2014 I'm home! I snack on almonds while I stare at the fridge, trying to decide what to cook. My parents are having a date night, so I'm watching the little sister tonight. 6 p.m. \u2014 I make myself a quick stir-fry with all the vegetables I can find in the fridge, and cook up udon noodles for my little sister. 7 p.m. \u2014 More  Kingdom Hearts  with the little sister! We play for two hours until it's time for her to go to bed. 9 p.m. \u2014 I start coughing and feeling a little under the weather.

I pull out my laptop and scroll through social media. Then I check on my book's sales to see how it's doing. This month was pretty slow, but I don't mind. I published the book for myself, and wasn't looking to make a profit, since I have a good full-time gig. Then my sister and I spend more time planning out the podcast. 12 p.m. \u2014 Time to eat! I make a mushroom-and-feta omelet. It ends up looking very ugly, and I'm sure Jacques Pepin would not approve, but I think it's delicious. 3 p.m. \u2014 Every weekend I babysit my little sister until 3 p.m. Once my mom is home, my sister and I head to the mall. I've been wanting to get my ears pierced for some time now, so I head straight to Claire's and get it done. My piercer was incredibly sweet, and I'm excited about all the tacky earrings I can now rock!  $31 7 p.m. \u2014 My sister and I spend a few hours perusing the mall, and then walk around the area to take outfit pictures of her. She's trying to step up her Instagram game, and since I'm a social media professional, she has forced me to help her out. She does a few outfit changes in the car, and we get a lot of good pictures!

My best friend is a nurse who works nights, so it's tough for us to get to spend time together. Since I just moved back to Dallas, I don't have many other friends to spend time with, but I don't mind. My sister and I end up binging  Grey's Anatomy  until midnight.

(I know, I know, I should shop local, but my suburb doesn't have any good local bookstores.) I look around for a while before deciding on  Hamlet . I'm trying to read and reread classics because I never appreciated them in high school. I've always loved Shakespeare, and it's been a while since I've read this one.  $13 12 p.m. \u2014 I'm home and starving, especially after my workout.

I catch up on  Brooklyn Nine-Nine . This show is so funny, and it has a openly bisexual character! Everyone needs to watch it! 10 p.m. \u2014 Reading time.

I somehow manage to straighten my hair in fifteen minutes, so I slap on makeup before heading out the door. 11 a.m. \u2014 Lunchtime! We have a team lunch today, which is paid for by the company. (We do this once a month.) We head to a Tex-Mex place where the food is just alright. My coworkers and I discuss the recent Facebook scandal and the Zuckerberg testimony.

Waking up on Mondays usually sucks, but my dad flew back to Seattle with me before he heads home, and we have a busy schedule today.

He's staying in a hotel in my neighborhood, so we meet at a coffee shop up the street. A latte and half a spinach quiche are waiting for me when I arrive\u2026parents, FTW! We surprisingly don't hit traffic and arrive at our first meeting 15 minutes early, a rare occurrence in my family. 1 p.m. \u2014 Our last meeting is a casual lunch and we're relieved because that quiche is not gonna hold us over much longer. We get to the restaurant early, and I pay for parking ($10). We order chips, salsa, guacamole, and margaritas while we wait. When our colleague arrives, we order a second round of drinks, but I switch to vino verde because two margs seems aggressive for a Monday afternoon. I also get the vegetarian enchiladas per the waitress's recommendation and a side of rice and beans for the table. Turns out the enchiladas have peas in them, and while I have nothing against peas, I'm also not convinced they belong in enchiladas? Oh well, they're tasty enough (and free), so no complaints here.

If I'm given 70L to pack in, I'm packing 70L worth of clothes! I'll make the dude pack light. I also have a gift card from my birthday, so the total for both packs is $252.76.

Head next door to pick up a prescription ($10 on my card).  $110 4:45 p.m. \u2014 Back home, and my poor pup has been home alone all day, so I leash him up for a walk. About halfway through the walk, I realize my boyfriend used the last of the bags this morning and forgot to refill them.  Fantastic.  I've been the victim of stepping in dog shit three times in the past two months, so I suck it up, walk home for bags, and come back to clean up after the dog. When we get home, I feed him and start making the chili in my Instant Pot (the Christmas gift I didn't ask for but now can't live without). Boyfriend gets home from work, turns on the Mariner's game, and announces he must run out for beer (because sports).

I jump on the webinar, drink two cups of coffee, and make myself peanut butter banana toast to combat the caffeine jitters. 10.30 a.m. \u2014 Check my budgeting app to import new transactions and make a few adjustments. I recently finished a two-month trial and decided to make the small investment to help with my quest for financial stability. It took a little while to adjust, but I'm really starting to notice a shift in the way I think about money and budgeting, and it has become something I actually look forward to doing.

My Dad, sister, and I are going to visit my other sister, and we're buying these tickets because our dad is funding the majority the trip. I have been completely financially independent since I graduated college (besides Netflix\u2026 the horror!), but after my parents' divorce a few years ago, my dad loves getting us together as much as possible and is more than happy to foot the bill since we're all over the country and wouldn't be able to afford it otherwise.

Casey and Danielle are so effing funny and this episode's guest is Roxane Gay. I can't help myself from laughing out loud. If you watch Bravo and don't listen to this, you're missing out. They're self-aware and fully embrace the ridiculousness that is  Housewives.  It is amazing. 6:15 p.m. \u2014 I'm meeting a new friend/colleague for dinner because she's in town for work. She also works for her family business, and we really hit it off when we met earlier this year. After getting ready, I call a Lyft ($10.89) and head to one of my favorite restaurants, Manolin. I arrive early to put our name in and then have a glass of ros\u00e9 outside by the fire, drizzle be damned! When she arrives, we share a bunch of small plates (plantain chips, sunchoke kale, mussels, black squid rice, and pork belly with squash) over wine and good conversation about our industry.

Ah, springtime in Seattle. 4:30 p.m. \u2014 Work is finished, so I tidy up and run to TJ's to pick up snacks for tonight. I get jalape\u00f1o artichoke dip, cheese, salami, grapes, two frozen appetizers (their strongest department, IMO), pita chips, a baguette, and dish soap, and then ask an employee to bring me the mushiest bananas they can find from the back. I also taste a couple of wines because Trader Joe's is so fancy now, but decide to be boring and get two of my go-tos. Venmo request my friend for her share.  $37.45 5:15 p.m. \u2014 Back home. I take a shower and then have a glass of wine while making the banana bread. Boyfriend pops in from work to change and give me a kiss before he heads to the venue to soundcheck and hang with friends before his show. 7 p.m. \u2014 My friend arrives and we spend the evening catching up until she leaves at 11:30. I'm surprisingly not tired, so I watch an episode of  Unreal  until the BF gets home bearing late-night cheeseburgers. Be still my heart!

We lay in bed for 20 minutes brainstorming ways of tricking him into thinking all mornings are weekdays. Alas, today is not that day. My BF gets ready to meet up with his dad and their dog for a playdate. When they get back (nice and wet), I mention that I just used the last of the coffee and our half and half is a bit questionable, so he runs to out to restock these two very necessary staples ($10.85 on joint card). When he returns, we eat spinach scrambles and bacon while watching  Cash Cab  and meal planning for next week, our Saturday morning tradition.  $10.85 10:45 a.m. \u2014 BF puts on a record and we dance to Talking Heads while busting out household chores. He cleans the bathroom and takes out the trash/recycling/compost while I dust, vacuum, Swiffer, wash our sheets and towels, and water the plants. We have our system down pat, and my constant tidying and sweeping up dog hair throughout the week makes it go quickly! 12 p.m. \u2014 My boyfriend drops me off at Orange Theory so I'm not late. I start feeling nauseous at the very end of class, and realize I must have not taken my medicine with enough food before class. Get home and have a bite of leftover pizza in the fridge and immediately feel better. Pizza cures all. Advertisement 2 p.m. \u2014 Take a long, hot shower, make half a turkey scramble wrap with grapefruit, and watch TV. BF's friends pick him up at 3 for an hour-long drive to see Car Seat Headrest and get dinner before (#mandate), so I do laundry and walk the dog until I have to leave for babysitting. I used to nanny full-time and have remained close to the family, so I pick the boys up from school once a week and babysit here and there. Tonight we order pizza and root beers, and I get a detailed recap of their spring break trip to Disneyland. Then we watch  Lilo & Stitch,  and I get in plenty of snuggles while reading books before bed. 11:45 p.m. \u2014 Home and exhausted. After being bombarded with dog howls and kisses, I let him out, do my nightly skincare routine, and read in bed for 20 minutes before passing out in our freshly laundered sheets. Is there anything better? I think not. Daily Total: $10.85", "day_seven": "Day Seven: 8:30 a.m. \u2014 Our dog is too smart for us, so we don't even attempt to trick him. BF meets his dad and his dad's dog, and I make coffee. I sneak a small cup even though I shouldn't because I'm doing a sensory deprivation float for the first time today, and they recommend not having caffeine before, but banana bread without coffee would just be a crime. My boyfriend gave me a Groupon for the float, thinking it would be a fun way for me to relax, so even though I'm a little nervous, I'm going to give it a try! Advertisement 10 a.m. \u2014 Run to TJ's for this week's haul: berries, spinach, asparagus, avocados, red onion, baby potatoes, chives, grapefruit, eggs, whole wheat bread, ground turkey, salmon, salsa, guacamole, cheddar cheese, black beans, hummus, laundry detergent, paper towels, body wash, and flowers because it's dreary AF, and I need a lil pick-me-up ($87 on joint card). Somehow I miraculously made it before the Sunday rush and I'm home within a half hour, so I unpack the groceries and make toast with Laughing Cow cheese, radishes, smoked salmon, chives, and Everything But the Bagel seasoning. I eat it with a grapefruit while watching Beyonce's Coachella performance from last night. DEAD.  $87 12 p.m. \u2014 Float time \u2013 wish me luck! 1:30 p.m. \u2014 Welllll...hmm. After what I assume is the closest I've ever come to a minor panic attack and almost getting out only 10 minutes in, I survived! It took me awhile to get comfortable, and it was really hard to turn by brain off, but I'm glad I tried it! I'll probably stick to yoga or a massage when I want to relax, though. I throw my wet hair in a top knot, slap on blush and Boy Brow, and walk over to a local coffee shop to meet the boys' mom I babysat last night. They got home too late to catch up for long, so we decided on a coffee date today! I arrive first, so I get tea for her and a cappuccino and croissant for me ($13.34 with tip). We chat for an hour, and she gives me $160 in cash for last night and an IOU for the past month of school pick-ups.  $13.34 Advertisement 2:45 p.m. \u2014 I stop in a cute little shop on the way back to my car to pick up a birthday card for a friend. Conveniently, there is a gorgeous clothing store next door, and I can't help but go in. I want everything but get nothing, and thank my new budgeting skills for giving me this restraint.  $6.57 3:30 p.m. \u2014 My boyfriend and I decide to check out a local brewery. We each get a beer (he pays) and play cards until it's time to go to his dad and stepmom's house for Sunday dinner. They host whenever they're in town, and we try to make it at least once or twice a month. Tonight, we have shredded pork tacos and salad, and I drink a pomegranate hard cider. 7:30 p.m. \u2014 Stop by TJ's to grab a bottle of wine and popcorn ($11.59). At home, we change into comfies and I put on a Glossier face mask before renting  Moonstruck  on Amazon ($4.39). About 10 minutes into the movie, I notice a crackling in my ear due to leftover Epsom salt from the float, and it's driving me nuts. I Google ways to get rid of it and grumpily tell my boyfriend we need to go to Bartell to pick up hydrogen peroxide. Run to the store (where I realize I still have my face mask on \u2013 LOL), get the goods ($1.99), and on the way home find a contradicting article reporting how dangerous it can be to mix hydrogen peroxide with vinegar. Damn you, Internet! Even though I'm sure it's fine, in a moment of panic I skip the peroxide and mix water with white vinegar that we already had at home, of course. My boyfriend drops a teaspoon into my ear canal, and it actually works! Thank god. Apologize to my boyfriend for momentarily blaming him and his dumb Groupon for my troubles.  $17.97 Advertisement 8:45 p.m. \u2014 Back to our regularly scheduled programming! I'm loving this movie, but I finish it alone because I somehow end up with a snoozing dog to my left and a snoozing boyfriend to my right. Get ready for bed and read before dozing off.

I bring an avocado and goat cheese as my contribution. We gossip over omelets and then play a rousing game of Monopoly, which we agree is the perfect escape from reality. 4:45 p.m. \u2014 I walk to another friend's apartment, which is only 10 minutes away. I'm going to get my ID and credit card, which I left in her wallet last night, but we inevitably chat and snack for a bit before I leave. Snacking really gets me through this Sunday, both emotionally and financially. 8 p.m. \u2014 I take a yoga class to rejuvenate after an expensive and unhealthy (albeit extremely fun) weekend. I'm not sure what \u201ctoxins\u201d actually are, but by the end I feel like I've released them, and my body is reset.

Bean lunch box. I always make coffee at home to save time and money, and I drink it while I listen to a podcast on my commute. Today, it's an episode of NPR's  Code Switch  about an Afro-Latina musician named Amara La Negra. Advertisement 9:45 a.m. \u2014 I'm trying to be more chill at work, since I have a tendency to overthink and overwork in order to make things perfect. I create a schedule for the week that allows me to just supervise and manage, which are the most important parts of my role. I eat the breakfast I packed for myself (Greek yogurt, Trader Joe's almond clusters, and a little honey) while volunteers tutor our students. 12 p.m. \u2014 My breakfast is never enough to keep me full for long. I eat my lunch (leftover Trader Joe's ravioli with roasted asparagus and eggplant that I made last week) while doing some data entry. 3:30 p.m. \u2014 I leave work shortly after the school day ends and sneak in a quick trip to the gym before my weekly therapy appointment in Soho. I started seeing my therapist about six months ago, and I seriously look forward to it every week. 6:30 p.m. \u2014 I get home and call my mom \u2014 it's her birthday! I'm heading to the grocery store and ask her if she's cooked anything especially good recently. She is basically paleo, and I am  very much not , but she makes a lot of creative stuff, so I seek inspiration from her from time to time. She suggests I buy cauliflower to roast, and I do. I call my best friend in Chicago while shopping and charge the groceries to my EBT card. (I receive $194 per month in food stamps.) I head home to meal prep for the rest of the week with the items I just bought and stuff I already have from my last Trader Joe's trip.

I leave with coffee in hand, but it feels like no amount of caffeine will be enough to enliven me. 10:30 a.m. \u2014 Yogurt and almonds time. 12:45 p.m. \u2014 Today I have to eat my lunch while tutoring a student. Usually they make fun of me for eating food that they think is weird. The best comment I've heard was: \u201cMiss, why are you eating grass? That's soooo nasty.\u201d But today the kids are unfazed by my mishmash of wild rice, lentils, Trader Joe's Vegetable Masala veggie burger, and roasted veggies. 3:30 p.m. \u2014 At the gym, I spontaneously decide to do the Arc Trainer, and then quickly realize I have no clue what it even is. Seriously, what is it? All I know is, my quads are burning. 5 p.m. \u2014 I shower and fry up Trader Joe's Thai Vegetable Gyoza, which I eat with soy sauce and Sriracha for an early dinner before Hindi class, which is (unfortunately) in Midtown. I stop by the dry cleaner on the way to drop off two pairs of pants that ripped in the last few weeks. One tore when it got caught on a door handle. How does that even happen?

I still bring coffee. 10 a.m. \u2014 After tutoring an adorable student, I eat my yogurt and granola while catching up on the news. Paul Ryan announced he will not seek reelection, and I am ecstatic. Then I Google him and find out his sign is Aquarius, which is odd since he is a spineless sheep. 12:55 p.m. \u2014 I find it virtually impossible to meal prep enough for an entire week, so I try to keep a few pre-made lunches around. Today I'm microwaving Trader Joe's Paneer Tikka Masala, which is not the most filling, but is excellent as far as affordable frozen vegetarian meals go. As I eat, I buy bus tickets to go to D.C. with a friend this weekend! It's our last chance to see the cherry blossoms, and I've been itching to get out of the city for a night. Since we're going Friday to Saturday and booking last minute, tickets aren't the cheapest ($88 total).

For dinner I cook Trader Joe's Mandarin Orange Morsels (orange-flavored fake chicken) and a scallion pancake. 8 p.m. \u2014 I'm going on a date! We matched on Tinder, and it's our second time hanging out. Dating is hard and second dates are scarce, so I'm excited. I chose a bar in my neighborhood last time, so tonight he picked the spot, and I make the trek into Manhattan. Last time, I introduced him to Narragansett, my favorite cheap beer (I'm biased because last year I lived in Rhode Island, where it's made). The bar has cans for $3, much to our satisfaction. He puts down his card, and there's a minimum; I tell him I'll get the drinks at the next spot. After two beers each, we walk to a nearby bar that a friend suggested. It's little more upscale, so we get the cheapest thing on the menu: $5 Tecates. We bond over our mutual disdain for olives, and he walks me to the train.  $12.89 Daily Total: $56.89", "day_five": "Day Five: 6:40 a.m. \u2014 Ugh. Going to work after a night of three beers is the worst. Once I get to my desk, I munch on a granola bar in the hopes that it will revive me. 9:45 a.m. \u2014 Coffee saves the day again.

I'm making myself go because I know I won't have time tomorrow between work and catching the bus to D.C. I do a lackluster workout and walk home, where I find my roommate made chocolate chip cookies! I immediately snack on them, as well as Salt & Vinegar Kettle Chips (my favorite food of all time, probably), and continue working on grad school applications with  The Office  playing in the background. 7:20 p.m. \u2014 A. and I are lounging on the couch and she makes a box of bowties. I already had pasta for lunch, but I can't pass up an opportunity to avoid cooking, so I eat it anyway, with marinara and goat cheese. 8:25 p.m. \u2014 D., another roommate, and I go to trivia at a bar around the corner from our apartment. We love it there because it's so low stakes \u2014 there are only four rounds and the guy running it asks the question through a megaphone.

It definitely wasn't bad, but, how can I improve this meal? Lettuce? Lime? Skip the tofu? 4 p.m. \u2014 After dropping my laptop at home and grabbing my bag for D.C., I hop on the train to meet my friend, V., in Midtown for our bus. I get there early and run into Duane Reade for snacks: Clif bar, mini pack of Milanos, and a lime seltzer. (I pay using food stamps.) V. and I meet on 7th Avenue and wait for our steed. ($11.89 expensed) 6 p.m. \u2014 Things take a turn. Turns out, buying the cheapest Friday afternoon bus tickets from New York to D.C. is not a wise spending choice. We haven't even made it to the Lincoln Tunnel yet when we get into a fender bender. We're waiting on the street for upwards of an hour with no information, so V. and I call the bus company to try to get a refund. They pretend they can't hear us and hang up \u2014 a bad omen for Friday the 13th \u2014 and the driver shuffles us back on the bus. We think we're finally leaving, until we realize the driver is not on the bus and has locked us in. Nightmares become reality. The emergency exit is locked, too. Some other passengers are freaking out with us, but others still have their headphones on and are pulling out their dinners. It's bizarre. Eventually, V. slams on the horn until the driver comes back and lets us out. We run out and eat the cost of the bus tickets in favor of not being trapped in a moving vehicle for five hours.

I eat half of a pear and gorgonzola pizza and save the rest for a lunch next week. My friend puts down her card and we Venmo her.

We head to the East Village for an early dinner with another friend. She does theater and works weird hours, so we're meeting her during her break before a rehearsal. We wander around 2nd Avenue and eventually settle on Mighty Quinn's Barbecue, even though two of us are vegetarians, because the sides are delicious and the windows are open. We gossip over mac and cheese, kale slaw, and sweet potato casserole before she goes back to rehearsal.  $11.05 Advertisement 7 p.m. \u2014 V.'s been wanting new clothes, so I decide to be his personal shopper for the evening.

I have a hard time falling back asleep, wondering if it was the right decision. 9:15 a.m. \u2014 We're up! My husband heads to the garage for more work on the truck and I relax in bed with the pups. 10:30 a.m. \u2014 I actually get up and make myself look presentable. I have a scheduled video call with my team at noon, so I spend time preparing what I want to go over. I eat a protein bar, which will tide me over until our brunch plans later. 12 p.m. \u2014 My leadership team and I lead a successful call. This kind of stuff is important to our business and I really enjoy doing it. 1 p.m. \u2014 The mom of one of my husband's childhood friends is in town visiting, so we meet her for brunch. I've only met her once (she flew up for our wedding), but we keep in touch on Facebook. She's really sweet and it's nice to see her. She ends up generously picking up the bill. On the way home, we stop by Redbox and grab a few movies. While we're driving, we talk about the call we got last night and decide we want to call the social worker back and offer to take in the little boy if he still needs a place to go. Making that kind of decision in the middle of the night is pretty difficult, and we're feeling better about the situation now. His caseworker says she actually found him a placement with a special education teacher. We're happy to hear he's in a safe place.  $4.54 Advertisement 3 p.m. \u2014 When we get home, we load up the truck to take the trash to the landfill. We don't pay for trash service because the landfill is less than five minutes away and it's way cheaper. Our borough sends a coupon in the mail twice a year, so today's load is only $2.  $2 3:30 p.m. \u2014 Home! We've had a busy weekend, so we're both ready to plop down on the couch and watch our movies. We put in  Daddy's Home 2  first and each snuggle up with a dog. 7:30 p.m. \u2014 We pause our movie marathon to order pizza ($22.77) and a crazy fry concoction from a burger place down the street ($7.99). My husband starts a load of laundry (because he's one of those amazing mythical beings who does his own!) and leaves to go pick up the food. I should get up and do something productive while he's gone, but I play Candy Crush instead.  $30.76 9:30 p.m. \u2014 We made it all the way through  A Bad Moms Christmas.  Two movies in one day is pretty impressive for my husband, as he's not great at sitting still. He has to get up early for work, so it's bedtime. I always get in bed with him, but I read, get work done, or watch Netflix for hours before I'm actually ready to sleep. Tonight I choose  Friends ! 11:30 p.m. \u2014 This is early for me, but I'm actually pretty sleepy! I've been trying to get better at not staying up till 1 or 2 a.m., so it's sleep time. Advertisement Daily Total: $37.30", "day_three": "Day Three: 9 a.m. \u2014 I'm up! I take the dogs to daycare on Mondays, so I make myself get out of bed right away. My husband texts me and says he forgot to clip our pit's nails, so I need to do it before I drop them off. Ugh...I don't wanna! She's a squirmy little sucker and she hates it, but I get it done. I get them fed and off we go. They LOVE daycare. As soon as I turn onto the road they start freaking out because they know exactly where we are. 10 a.m. \u2014 Today's a work from home day and I have a lot of random things to get done. I set a timer on my phone for 30 minutes and sit down with a book. I have to time myself or else I won't get anything else done. I eat a protein bar for breakfast while reading. I really need to go grocery shopping today. When the timer goes off, I check my social media notifications, answer questions, and respond to the messages that came in while I was reading. I have an appointment at noon, so I need to get up and actually get ready for the day. 11:45 a.m. \u2014 I head to my lash extension appointment. The owner of the spa I work for does them. I hate lying still for so long, but it's amazing and I'm addicted. I typically get two fills a month. They're $75 a pop, but she gave me a freebie, which I use today. Advertisement 1:30 p.m. \u2014 I go to the post office and realize I forgot my packing tape at home! I have a habit of walking out the door without all the things I need. I head to the store to pick up a few things. My husband travels a lot for work, but he'll be in town for most of the week, so I mainly need stuff for his lunches. There's only one grocery store around here with a good selection of organic produce, so I always shop there. Organic Honeycrisp apples are on sale! They're normally $4.59 per pound and today they're only $2.29. Serious score. I usually spend about $15 a week on five apples \u2014 that's Alaskan produce for ya! I grab carrots, radishes, lettuce, bananas, Alaska Grains bread (I try to buy locally-made things as much as possible), English muffins, cottage cheese, sliced cheese, Pop chips, and my weakness \u2013 white Monster energy drinks. I don't drink coffee and I don't have one every day \u2013 but what can I say, I just love them!  $64.91 2:30 p.m. \u2014 I swing by my house to drop off groceries and pick up packing tape. I heat up leftover pizza for lunch and throw in a load of laundry. I snap a picture of my grocery receipt and enter it into my Receipt Hog and Receipt Pal apps. I get points every time I submit a receipt and can redeem them for Visa/Amazon gift cards. I've only been using them for a couple months and I think it'll take me about forever and a day before I earn anything substantial, but who am I to turn down free money?! Advertisement 3 p.m. \u2014 Let's try this again! I almost left without the packing tape again...I always have a roll in my car because I make frequent trips to the post office, but I took it out when I got my car detailed a couple weeks ago. It's now back in its proper home \u2013 a.k.a. my cup holder. I stop at a little contract post office that only takes cash, so I pull money out of the ATM there. Of course there's a fee ($4). I mail a gift to one of my customers ($3.75). This post office is tiny and rarely has a line, so I forgive its cash-only status. Then I run right down the road to get two months' worth of probiotics ($40.11) from a nutritional store, before running into one last store because my husband forgot to tell me he needs mayo and a apparently a sandwich just isn't the same without it. I spy speckled jelly beans and I have to grab those too ($9.71).  $57.57 4:30 p.m. \u2014 Sometimes the whole \"work from home\" thing doesn't involve a lot of time at home! I have time to get chores done before I have to pick up the dogs. I typically clean the house on Mondays and I'd like to get as much as I can out of the way before my husband gets home. Part of the deal of me being a work at home dog mom is that I do most of the cleaning and pack my husband's lunches. I think that's pretty darn fair since he works 60-80 hours per week. Advertisement 6 p.m. \u2014 My husband gets home way earlier than usual, so we go pick up our fur children together. Daycare is worth every penny; they have so much fun and it wears them out. I'd love to be able to take them every day, but for now they typically go twice a week. I guess my husband got new tunes for his truck to help haul the fifth wheel better, so we're going on a test run to see how it drives. This is not my department, I'm just along for the ride. 7 p.m. \u2014 I cook dinner when we get home \u2014 chicken fettuccine alfredo. We watch an episode of  Parks and Recreation  while we eat. Most of the time we sit at the table without the TV, but we both kinda want to decompress tonight. After dinner, my husband has work to do for a class he's taking this week for his job. I prep lunches for the rest of the week: veggies, cottage cheese, and yogurt. 9 p.m. \u2014 I feel a migraine coming on, so I smoke pot and get in bed. I generally only smoke if I have a migraine or am getting one, which unfortunately is much more frequently than I appreciate. I bought this vape pen thing (which just makes me a little sad, because I think vaping is incredibly stupid, but it's convenient and doesn't dry out) at the dispensary for $90 about three months ago and the cartridge is about half gone. My drug habit is definitely cheaper than my prescription migraine medication! Advertisement Daily Total: $122.48", "day_four": "Day Four: 8:45 a.m. \u2014 I wake up and my head still hurts. It's better than last night, but definitely not gone. I'm super grateful for the night shift mode on my iPhone, because otherwise I couldn't even look at it when I have a migraine. I enter information into my Migraine Buddy app. It's supposed to help track patters and give me insights into what the causes are. I've gotten migraines since I was 12 and I still haven't figured it out! Today I have to be at the spa though, so since I'm not dying I get up, grab a quick breakfast and go. 10 a.m. \u2014 I have a few projects I'm working on here at the spa. I have a pretty set system of how I do things because I'm only here two and a half days per week, so I try to be as productive as possible. I'm almost constantly interrupted, but I'm used to it by now. This summer I'll be traveling with my husband for his job, so I'll be working remotely 90% of the time. I can't wait! 3 p.m. \u2014 The rest of the day is super hectic and I don't accomplish as much as I had hoped I would. It doesn't help that my head still hurts. 6:30 p.m. \u2014 I have a team video chat scheduled. I set up two per month for us to come together, do training, talk goals, and ask questions \u2013 whatever my team needs. I'm in communication with the people closely under me very frequently, but it's nice to touch base with my team members further down the line sometimes. Advertisement 7;30 p.m. \u2014 Dinnertime! I hate cooking in general, especially when I've had a crazy day, so I throw together a pre-cooked roast and mashed potatoes. Easy and yummy. 10 p.m. \u2014 We get in bed and my husband almost instantly falls asleep. I take time to catch up on my social media and respond to messages. I haven't looked at Instagram all day! Social media is a big part of my business, but some days I just don't have the energy to keep up with it. It's probably time for a day off soon. Every once in a while I'll just put my phone away for the entire day, which is rather refreshing! I watch Netflix and finally go to sleep at about 2 a.m. Daily Total: $0", "day_five": "Day Five: 9 a.m. \u2014 After hitting snooze a few times, I actually open my eyes all the way. I don't usually set an alarm, but I woke up earlier when my husband left and read for a while till I could fall back asleep, which always throws me off. My snuggly dogs make it incredibly difficult to get up. They want breakfast, and I need to get my act together and get ready. 10 a.m. \u2014 Get to the spa and get right to work. I have a project I've been working on for 10 months and I can finally see the light at the end of the tunnel! This will pretty much consume my time until it's finalized \u2013 hopefully next week. Advertisement 2:30 p.m. \u2014 Take a mini break and eat cottage cheese, mandarins, and crackers. I try to get my husband to tell me what he wants for dinner \u2013 a.k.a. the hardest decision on the planet. 6:15 p.m. \u2014 I intended to go to the gym after work, but I forgot my gym bag and I'm just not feeling it. I normally go three to four times a week, but if I'm busy I don't force myself. I really enjoy working out, so I never want it to feel like a chore. I hop on the computer and submit our applications for our Permanent Fund dividends. It's an Alaska thing. Put extremely simply, each year, qualifying residents receive a payment tied to the oil revenue the state makes. It varies from year to year: In years past, I've gotten between $800 and $2,200. We have the option to select a nonprofit to pledge part of our dividends to. This year, we chose an organization that helps homeless teens in our area with housing, education, and job skills. I also order a Bite Agave Lip Mask from Sephora. My lips are insanely dry and a friend just recommended this, so I'm gonna try it out. It's $26, but I have a gift card. 8:30 p.m. \u2014 My husband just got home with tortillas, so I make tacos for dinner. You can literally never go wrong with tacos. I could eat them every day. We talk about our days and play with the dogs for a while after we eat.  $4.29 Advertisement 10 p.m. \u2014 Bedtime for one of us! I stay up till about 12:30 reading and getting work done. Daily Total: $4.29", "day_six": "Day Six: 8:15 a.m. \u2014 Somehow, morning has appeared again. I am so not a morning person, but I get up and feed the dogs and send my husband a good morning/thank you text. I didn't realize he put my car in the garage after he was done working on his truck last night. Much appreciated, as it's still about 15 degrees in the mornings. That message is shortly followed by a \"WTF?!\" one when I get out of the shower and realize he stole my towel. Scoundrel... I finish getting ready for the day. How much effort I put in definitely depends on how much sleep I want. I have lash extensions and my eyebrows are microbladed, so most days I mix Laura Mercier tinted moisturizer and Stila Stay All Day beauty balm, slap that on, and comb my brows and lashes. Piece of cake. I do like playing with makeup when I have time, but it's not my first priority. 10 a.m. \u2014 I drop the dogs off at daycare \u2013 and I don't even have to get out of the car! I open the back hatch, they jump out, and the owner meets them at the door. (They don't even turn around to say goodbye...) I head to the spa, where I work for a few hours. Thursdays are usually pretty quiet, so I can get work done in peace. Advertisement 2:45 p.m. \u2014 I leave the spa later than normal because the owner comes in and we talk for a while. Now I'm going to the borough office to talk to them about a business license for our Airbnb, because I like talking to humans rather than trying to figure that stuff out online. Since we'll be traveling so much this summer, we've decided to take advantage of our absence and get Airbnb guests! While in the parking lot, I remember to pay our cell phone bill. We have a Verizon Up credit available, so I select a code for a free movie download from Vudu. 3 p.m. \u2014 That was easy! The lady was super nice and explained exactly what I needed to do. I run into the grocery store to buy a gallon of milk. We only buy milk that comes from our local dairy, because milk pus is a real thing, people! I drive by the dairy farm all the time, so I feel better knowing exactly where it comes from.  $5.55 3:15 p.m. \u2014 Back at home, I make lunch and get to work. I have a decent amount of bookkeeping I need to finish up and send to our CPA for our taxes. I work on that, message with some of my customers, make a few social media posts, and overall have a very productive afternoon! I have to take a little break to run and get the dogs from daycare. 7:15 p.m. \u2014 We go to meet our friend we picked up from the airport the other night for dinner at our fave Mexican restaurant, which never disappoints. I have a weird thing where I need to make the total with tip an even number when I eat at restaurants, so it comes to $35.  $35 Advertisement 10 p.m. \u2014 We go to bed pretty much as soon as we get home. I end up watching the Barack Obama and Malala Yousafzai episodes of David Letterman's  My Next Guest Needs No Introduction  on Netflix. It's an interesting show.

I purchase both our state ($50) and borough ($100) business licenses. Next up is finalizing our Airbnb listing. I'm super excited and a little nervous. This summer is definitely going to be an adventure.  $150 1 p.m. \u2014 My husband comes home to pack for his work trip. He doesn't typically work on weekends unless he's on call, but a good friend of ours is going through a crazy custody battle and the trial is next week, so he's going on his trip this weekend so we can both be there to support him. He tells me he picked up a bottle of insulin on his way home so he has extra to take with him. He's a Type 1 diabetic, which is not freakin' cheap! Neither one of use has health insurance through our jobs and there's no way we could afford it through the marketplace. It sucks, but we make it work. I am super anti-Walmart, but they have their own generic insulin for $25 a bottle instead of $300 at the pharmacy we used to get it from. I can be okay with Walmart once a month if it saves us about $550.  $25.76 2 p.m. \u2014 Husband leaves for the airport. I'm never excited about that, but it's a frequent part of his job. Luckily, he's never gone for more than a few days at a time. 5:30 p.m. \u2014 A few friends come over so we can all ride together to a birthday dinner. We go to Benihana because she's never been there. Our chef is very funny and we have a lot of fun. Dinner is great, but of course this restaurant is more expensive for just me than dinner was for both of us last night ($43)! It's for a special occasion, though, and I'm glad I went. I purchased a gift card ($50) for her earlier in the day and a friend will split it with me later.  $93 9:45 p.m. \u2014 We are not feeling like party animals, so we all head home. I get in my PJs, grab ice cream from the freezer, and find something to watch on Netflix. The only plus sides to my husband being gone are not having to cook dinner and being able to binge whatever show I want. I'm actually pretty tired, though, and I try to take advantage of any night I feel like falling asleep before midnight, so I head to bed.

My cat, begging for breakfast, woke me twenty minutes ago and I dutifully, albeit sleepily, fed her. I grab my outfit for the day off the top of my dresser and head to the shower. 5:30 a.m. \u2014 I listen to the most recent The Moth podcast as I get ready for the day. The episode is about the places we go that shape our lives. As the first story teller comments on the pain of leaving her home, I look up and see all the boxes in my own home. My lease is about to end, but this time I'm moving into a new home by myself, and the reality of my recent breakup hits me hard. I step away from the kitchen and find myself back in the bedroom. I open the closet and find one of my boyfriend's shirts, which smells like him. As tears stream down my face, I remind myself that the breakup is for the best, even though I don't fully believe that just yet. 5:40 a.m. \u2014 I come back to the kitchen but tune out the podcast. I pack a banana and a Tupperware of homemade ham and potato soup for lunch. I opt to have Thai takeout leftovers for breakfast instead of my usual smoothie. As I savor my Thai food, I heat water so I can bring a thermos of cinnamon black tea to work as I do every day. I'm on the road by 6 a.m. Advertisement 11:30 a.m. \u2014 I'm a high school teacher, and my juniors are understandably struggling today after a week of standardizing tests including the dreaded SAT. I've had to be extra engaging all day today to make up for their lack of energy. Now it's lunchtime, and I plop into a seat in the staff lounge after heating up my soup. 3:30 p.m. \u2014 I'm home from work and it's the beginning of my weekend, but I start to wonder if I'm coming down with a cold. I scrounge around in the medicine cabinet to find DayQuil to help with my sore throat. It's raining outside, and the purple crocuses in the yard look beautiful during the storm. I force myself to be a bit productive by packing two boxes worth of books before taking a nap. 6 p.m. \u2014 I'm daydreaming about sushi, but make myself cook at home to save money. For dinner, I make pasta with a homemade sauce consisting of Italian sausage, onion, garlic, basil, diced tomatoes, and half-and-half. I pack up leftovers and bring them over to my friend's house. With me being sick and her being tired, we lazily spend the evening on her couch watching movies and talking. Despite it being a lackluster Friday night, I'm grateful for the company. I've been feeling lonely since my boyfriend (ex? that's painful to write) recently moved out. 10:30 p.m. \u2014 I make a pit stop at the local grocery store on my way home to pick up needed supplies before the ice storm kicks in: DayQuil, tissues, and cough drops.

Before opening my eyes, I hear the rapping on my window. The rain must have turned to sleet. I turn to look outside and find myself sharing my pillow with my cat. I get out of bed, make green tea, prepare a simple smoothie, and sit down by a window to read after taking a healthy dose of cold medicine. 11 a.m. \u2014 I come into the kitchen to do my dishes and notice some of my food has spoiled. I throw away a number of clementines and salad mix. I feel bad wasting food, but it's certainly hard shopping and cooking for one person. I'm not used to it yet. 2 p.m. \u2014 I spend my early afternoon alternating between grading student papers and reading. I take a break and grab boxes from my car that I pilfered from work. I turn on a Spotify playlist and get to work taking down the art from my walls. 3 p.m. \u2014 I keep seeing on Facebook that a lot of businesses in the area are losing power and closing. I decide to shower and cook an early dinner just in case I lose power too. I fry potatoes on the stove and add garlic, cheese, and a fried egg on top. Simple, but tasty. 4 p.m. \u2014 The rain and general gloominess are relentless and uncharacteristic of April in Michigan. It's bringing me down. I've kept myself busy all day, but in this quiet moment, I think of my ex and my heart just aches. I want to reach out to him and see how he's doing, but I know I shouldn't and space is what we need right now. I look around the room and see constant reminders of him. This was our apartment, after all. I don't want to dwell in this sadness, so I make myself take a nap. Advertisement 5 p.m. \u2014 I start focusing on my plans for the evening. Earlier in the week, I spontaneously reached out to Z., a guy I met in college. I asked him if he wanted to grab a drink sometime, and he said yes. We're meeting tonight in a few hours. I don't know if it's a date or not. I tell myself it isn't so I don't get nervous. As someone who has always been in long-term relationships, I haven't really dated as an adult. The thought freaks me out a bit. I take out my phone and do some light Facebook stalking. I don't think he has a girlfriend. I see recent pictures of him and his dog and of his recent travels. I make a mental note to ask him about both. 6:45 p.m. \u2014 A great part about my neighborhood is its walkability. I don a bunch of layers to protect myself from the wind and sleet and walk the few blocks to the restaurant where Z. and I are meeting. I arrive a bit early, take a seat near the back, and order a cider. 7 p.m. \u2014 As I wait for Z., a strange man walks up, makes a lot of eye contact, and bends over for a hug. I give him a one-armed hug as I rack my mind to figure out who he is. He starts to sit down and I say, \"Uhh, I don't think I'm the person you're meeting.\" He realizes he's made a mistake and walks away abruptly. The people at the tables next to me chuckle. We assume he was on a Tinder date. I hope he found who he was actually looking for. Advertisement 7:15 p.m. \u2014 Z. finds me and sits down. Over the next few hours, we talk about anything and everything: our travels, jobs, aspirations, college memories, and so on. The conversation flows easily. I like his smile. At one point, when ordering our second drinks, he says: \"I have to know \u2013 is this a date?\" I laugh and say that I don't really know, but it can be. He says he'd like that. For a moment, it's a bit uncomfortable, but our conversation picks up easily. 10:30 p.m. \u2014 By the end of the night, I've only had two drinks: a cider and a cocktail. With tip, the bill comes to $17.50. Before we leave, Z. says, \"Maybe this is too soon, but would you like to come over for dinner tomorrow? I'll cook.\" He then adds, \"Just promise not to murder me.\" I laugh because I appreciate a comment like that. He's right; spending time with a stranger does bring up questions about safety, at least for me. I tell him yes, and that that would be nice. We part ways with a second date in the books.

I'm on my computer in the breakfast nook and start looking at flights on Kayak. I'm heading to California this summer to participate in a National Endowment for the Humanities institute and I need to book my own transportation. One-way tickets from Grand Rapids to San Jose are $285. I decide to wait a few days to buy one to see if I can get a better price. 10:30 a.m. \u2014 There's a lot of back and forth in our group text on whether or not to cancel brunch. We ultimately decide to. I start daydreaming about a snow day tomorrow and getting my hopes up (hey, it's one of the perks of being a teacher!). As I start to plan the rest of my day, I toast an English muffin and slather on a generous amount of peanut butter and strawberry-rhubarb jam from the farmer's market. 1:30 p.m. \u2014 I inevitably start to feel a bit stir-crazy. I've been doing much of the same for the last few days and start feeling unsatisfied. While I'm sitting on the couch brushing my cat, my mind wanders to my ex. The pain and loss is a palpable thing. My chest hurts and I feel so heavy. I reach out to my best friend, M., through text for a bit of reassurance. I tell her how scared I am of the future and all the unknowns, about how the newness feels so heavy. M. sends a series of texts back: \"Be a little kinder to yourself and where you are and the decisions you're making. I think you're being too hard on yourself again. Each day gets you closer to where you want to be. Set small goals and allow life to happen.\" M. has always been there for me and has had to give me pep talks like this before. I don't fully accept her words, but I try. I want to. I breathe a bit easier. Advertisement 5:30 p.m. \u2014 It's time to head over to Z.'s house for dinner. I start to question if seeing him again is a good idea and if I'm ready to invest energy into a new person. I tell myself to take things one day at a time, though, and that making new acquaintances is what I need right now. Z. lives a little over a mile away from me in a different area of town, so I decide to drive. 6:30 p.m. \u2014 I'd been nervous about coming over, but Z. is so kind and his demeanor puts me at ease. I play with his dog as he cooks dinner and we chat. He serves me sweet potato and black bean tacos garnished with cilantro and avocado. After dinner, we notice the weather has finally let up, and Z. asks if I want to go for a walk in the woods outside his window. After days of feeling quarantined at home, I relish in the idea of being in the woods. 7 p.m. \u2014 Wearing our thickest boots, we tromp through snow, ice, and mud behind his dog, who excitedly leads the way. Z. and I share more about our families and our childhoods, bouncing from topic to topic. There isn't a lull in conversation and I can't tell if that's just because we're both so talkative, if it's out of nervousness, or if it's a combination of both. Regardless, talking with him is nice. We wind through the woods and trek across the neighborhood, making a big loop back to his house. Advertisement 8 p.m. \u2014 When we make it back to his driveway, I thank him for the dinner and say we should hang out again soon. My departure probably seems a bit abrupt, but whatever happens next in my life, I want to take it slowly. I'm conscious of my fragility and am trying to take care of my myself. 9 p.m. \u2014 When I make it home, I check my phone and see a snow day has been called for work tomorrow. This is the best surprise I can imagine. It's time to make the most of the evening then. After a brief ab workout at home, I draw a bath. I quickly Google household items to add to bath water and get the idea to add a quarter cup of coconut oil. I also add a few drops of lemon and rosemary essential oils. I go all out for this bath \u2013 I bring in a book, my Bluetooth speaker, my computer, and half a bottle of wine I opened earlier in the week. I read for a bit, but ultimately decide to turn on Sylvan Esso, slide a bit deeper into the bath, and enjoy the wine. The only thing standing between me and full relaxation is my cat, who \u2013 during every bath \u2013 thinks I'm in danger and stands on the edge of the tub, alternating between pleading eye contact and hissing at the water.

I quickly jump in the shower and make scrambled eggs with toast for breakfast. I make a mental note that I'm stupidly low on groceries. I pack a bag with my computer, a book, student papers, and my wallet, and head out to walk to a caf\u00e9. Advertisement 9 a.m. \u2014 The walk is tedious through the slush, but I get a call from my grandma, who asks if I want to come over for some homemade chicken noodle soup. I say yes. I can't remember the last time my grandma felt well enough to invite me over for lunch. 9:20 a.m. \u2014 From my house, I can easily walk to four different caf\u00e9s, so I rotate where I go. Today, this particular caf\u00e9 is relatively empty. I order a turmeric-ginger tea latte and use the time to submit a recent short story of mine to a number of literary publications, which is something I don't usually have time for. I'm pleased to have this extra day to myself and am grateful that I feel relatively positive today.  $5.50 12 p.m. \u2014 I drive to my grandma's house and find her in the yard throwing old French fries near some robins. She tells me she's feeding them because: \"How are they supposed to find food in this snow?\" We head inside and she nearly force-feeds me bowl after bowl of chicken soup and crusty bread as she presses me with questions on my new house. I try to seem excited about the move. She gives me food to take home, as always. 3 p.m. \u2014 I feel inspired to do some downsizing. I go through my closet and find a handful shirts I never wear to give to the counseling office at my school to be given to students who need them. I take a dozen books to drop off at the nearest Little Free Library for someone else to discover. Then I take pictures of wall art I no longer like and post them on the Facebook Marketplace. Advertisement 5:30 p.m. \u2014 I peer inside the Tupperware my grandma gave me and can't tell what is what, but heat it up regardless. I give it a taste and it really is delicious, so I have it for dinner tonight. 7:30 p.m. \u2014 After pouring over prices and times, I order my tickets to head out west this summer. $336 for a one-way ticket to San Jose, CA, plus a trip from California to Seattle for $123 to vist my friend. I don't book a flight home just yet. These costs will eventually be reimbursed by the institute I'm participating in, but that check won't come until August.  $459 8 p.m. \u2014 Last night's bath was enjoyable enough to convince me to do it again tonight. I fill the tub and balance my gin and tonic with cucumber on the ledge as I settle in. This time, I bring my laptop in so I can watch  Baskets  on Hulu. A friend told me it was a funny show, but I find it irrevocably sad. 9:30 p.m. \u2014 I search for pajamas on this chilly night and find one of my ex's shirts again. I debate putting it on, questioning if it's the right thing to do. I slide it over my head and crawl into bed.

Begrudgingly, I proceed to get ready and fill my thermos with peppermint tea to help with my persistent stuffiness and headache. For lunch, I pack more of my pasta leftovers and vow to myself to bring something different tomorrow. I munch on peanut butter toast as I brush my cat, giving her a bit of attention before I leave. Advertisement 9 a.m. \u2014 During my prep hour, I email my principal to express my firm interest in only teaching English next year. Being new to the building, I spent a big chunk of this school year teaching a college-prep class dreaded by staff and students alike. I'm sure my request will be ignored, but I feel better at least verbalizing it. I check online to see if there are any open positions in neighboring districts. 10 a.m. \u2014 Z. texts me and asks if I've been to the new poke restaurant in my neighborhood. I text back and start to feel heavy. Hanging out with Z. was fun, but I'm beginning to recognize that I have a lot of healing to do. I make a mental note that I need to express this to Z. sometime this week. I can't keep seeing him and pretending I'm okay. 12 p.m. \u2014 Today feels harder than usual. I can't seem to shake the cloud hanging over me. The work hours go by in a blur. I only have a few more hours until I can head home. 3 p.m. \u2014 I slump into the couch as soon as I walk in the door. My cat jumps up and joins me in the sun. I remember my grad class meets this upcoming Saturday and I'm behind in my work. I get a lump in my throat and worry about not being prepared, but can't bring myself to work on it right now. I allow myself to rest and cry, but feel guilty as I fall behind in my responsibilities. Advertisement 6 p.m. \u2014 I walk to meet a friend for tacos and a beer. As she talks about her recent work trip, I notice a ring on her finger. She didn't tell me she got engaged. I expect to feel upset, but I don't. I'm glad for her. We order a large appetizer and two tacos apiece. She picks up dinner this time. We head across the street to a brewery and order PB&J ales. I pay for drinks and promise that dinner's on me next time.  $10.50 10:30 p.m. \u2014 I quickly tidy up the house and throw the ball for my cat before I head to sleep. I feel a bit better than I did earlier, acknowledging that my friends really do care about me.

I'm not hungry, but I force myself to eat. As I eat my cereal, I remember my friend telling me about ashwagandha supplements and how she takes them when she feels overly stressed. I'm skeptical, but do a quick bit of research and order a bottle off of Amazon on a whim.  $20 9:30 a.m. \u2014 I text a few trusted friends about the therapists they see and how they pay for it. The rave about their experiences and explain they only have a $20 copay. I convince myself it's something I should try. I look into my insurance and discover I'd have to pay my annual deductible of $1,350 before my insurance covers therapy. I'm crushed. I thought teacher's insurance was supposed to be amazing? I never come close to meeting my deductible and begin to feel like therapy isn't a viable option for me. Advertisement 2:30 p.m. \u2014 The work day is over and I rush to volunteering. Once a week, I volunteer at a nonprofit that works with young students on creative writing. 5:15 p.m. \u2014 Driving home, I receive a message from my ex saying he'll be stopping over tomorrow to get the last of his things. Suddenly it feels like I can't breathe again. I try to push it out of my mind, but I can't fight off the tears. 6:15 p.m. \u2014 I drown out my thoughts with episodes of  Grace and Frankie  on Netflix. For dinner, I rummage through my freezer and find homemade egg rolls. I look at the Budget Bytes recipe again for directions on reheating and pop them in the oven. As I watch Netflix and eat dinner, I pack a few boxes of items in the living room, feeling numb to reality. 7:30 p.m. \u2014 My close friend invites me over and I quickly accept the invitation. I can't stand being home anymore. We don't do much of anything, but I'm fine with that. 9:30 p.m. \u2014 I'm back home and head to sleep. My mind runs rampant with dreams all night.

I pick off pieces of the egg and feed it to my cat who's meowing next to me. She seems to live for moments like these. Advertisement 6:30 a.m. \u2014 I'm at work and I get a text from Z.: \u201cYour week going well?\u201d He's trying to be nice and make conversation. I figure this is when I should tell him how I'm really feeling. I draft a text to send to Z. I briefly explain that I'm in a rough place emotionally right now and need to figure out who I am and what I want now that I'm in this position of being newly single for the first time in my adult life. I state that I need to invest in myself before I can invest in others. I tell him he's very enjoyable to be around and if we continue to hang out, it'll need to be just as friends, not as potential partners. I hit send. 11 a.m. \u2014 My new lease is emailed to me. I read through it carefully while my students are busy. I still can't get over the pet fee being $50 per month with a (refundable) $400 pet security deposit. 3:30 p.m. \u2014 This is the last time my ex and I will be together at our house. We both cry, embrace, and tell each other happy memories that pass through our minds. We're trying so hard to end this on the best note we can. He packs his car with the rest of his things. We have one last kiss on the porch. We don't say goodbye. 5:30 p.m. \u2014 A friend of mine pulls up into the driveway to pick me up. She's taking me to a poetry reading to help get my mind off things. After the event, we head to the cocktail bar by my house and order drinks. I pick up the tab.  $25 Advertisement 11 p.m. \u2014 As I crawl into bed, I mull over everything that's happening, but am too tired to dig that deeply.

Lunch, done. 7 a.m. \u2014 15 minute commute to work. I work for a nonprofit with a lax schedule, so I'm one of the first people on my floor to arrive. I fire up Outlook and start responding to vendor emails. 11:30 a.m. \u2014 I finish my morning meetings and reheat my lunch in the microwave. I want to go outside for a walk, but it's raining. I settle on eating at my desk and browsing Reddit. 3:30 p.m. \u2014 I leave work a little early to make my therapy appointment. I used to see my psychologist twice a week, but I've tapered that down to once every two to three weeks now that my parents aren't paying for it anymore and I have a high-deductible health plan. I've worked with this psychologist for eight years now, and talking to her is a priceless comfort. Advertisement 4:45 p.m. \u2014 My therapy appointment is over. I feel drained but also lighthearted. We talked about my anxieties related to my face and body tremors, plus my dreams and fears related to having children. The medication I take is harmful to fetuses, and people with serious mental illnesses have a hard time \u2013 impossible, really \u2013 getting approved to adopt. My medication makes a normal life possible for me, but I've always wanted kids. It's been on my mind for the past few months, especially since my boyfriend of four years also wants kids. Google tells me that surrogates cost about $100,000-ish, which is a lot less than I would have expected. If I decide I want to have a child when I'm 35, which is in ten years, then I would need to save $10,000 per year starting now. 6 p.m. \u2014 I work from home a little to make up for the time I spent in therapy. Then I microwave a frozen meal for dinner. 8 p.m. \u2014 My boyfriend and I watch an episode of  Westworld . He downloads the show online for free somehow. We already used the free month HBO offers to new subscribers on the HBO Now app, and we're both too cheap to pay the 15 bucks a month. I feel bad and resolve to start paying for HBO when  Game of Thrones  starts up again in 2019. Daily Total: $0", "day_two": "Day Two: 5:30 a.m. \u2014 Wake up on the first alarm.

We do deadlifts, squats, lunges, calf raises, and hip thrusts. Advertisement 6:45 a.m. \u2014 Leave the gym, go home, and contemplate showering. I decide not to, and instead use baby wipes, deodorant, and dry shampoo. 8 a.m. \u2014 Arrive at work. It's been a goal of mine to bring my lunch four days a week. On Sunday I tried making shakshuka from a popular  New York Times  recipe that popped up on my Facebook feed. I plan to eat it for two lunches this week, and today is one of them. 11:30 a.m. \u2014 Emerge from meeting. My tremors have been getting worse lately, and I don't know why. The antipsychotic drugs I take for my schizophrenia have caused me to develop something called tardive dyskinesia, which, for me, manifests as facial grimacing and hand tremors. It's not terribly noticeable, but I told my coworkers I have Tourette's to explain away the tics. 12:30 a.m. \u2014 Eat lunch. This shakshuka is delicious! 5 p.m. \u2014 Leave work and head home. I put a few chicken breasts into the slow cooker every Sunday so I can have shredded chicken in the fridge for quick salads and tacos throughout the week. I microwave chicken mixed with cheese and heat up a couple taco shells in a skillet. I add salsa, rice, and the other half of the avocado that I opened up in the morning. Voila \u2013 dinner in seven minutes! 6 p.m. \u2014 My boyfriend gets home from work. We usually spend an hour after work talking and cuddling on the couch. He tells me about the mystery thief in his office who has been stealing lunches from the break room, and I tell him about my presentation at work that went well. Advertisement 7 p.m. \u2014 I head to the salon down the street to get a haircut. I see a junior stylist, which is considerably cheaper than getting a cut from the more experienced hairdressers at the salon. It's only 30 bucks for a cut, and I tip 20% as usual. My bangs come out a little wonky (they always do, no matter where I go) and I gingerly fix them in the bathroom with kitchen shears when I get home. My DIY bangs situation unsurprisingly doesn't work out, and I resign myself to bobby pins and head bands for the next couple of weeks.  $36 Daily Total: $36", "day_three": "Day Three: 7 a.m. \u2014 Wake up and make a quick breakfast of egg whites, avocado, leftover rice, and Sriracha.

I try to give about $20, which definitely isn't a lot (and I know I can do more\u2026), but it's the number I settled on. I try to pick local charities instead national ones.

I also get other food stalwarts like onion, peppers, kale, rice, chicken, limes, and my current obsession: Halo Top.  $45 8 p.m. \u2014 I head to the gym and do an easy workout on the elliptical.

We discuss some of the newer anti-psychotics on the market. I called three pharmacies beforehand to get price quotes on them with my insurance, and the most expensive came out to be over $500 per month. She tells me there are chemically similar meds on the market that are older and cheaper. She writes me a script, and I head to CVS to drop it off.  $200 Advertisement 9 a.m. \u2014 I head to work late because of my appointment. 12 p.m. \u2014 I eat my packed lunch \u2013 another salad.

My boyfriend and I are going to the U.K. in a few weeks and we haven't done any planning yet. 5:30 p.m. \u2014 I'm finished with work. One of my friends and I make an effort to go on long walks together a couple times a week, which we do today. She's a little older than me, and is hoping to get married in the next couple years. She's been with her boyfriend for seven years, but he keeps telling her he's not ready for marriage yet. I'm better friends with her boyfriend, so I tread carefully while she unpacks her feelings about the subject. 8 p.m. \u2014 I read my book,  Americanah , for about an hour. Then I do my skincare routine. I'm a little beauty product-obsessed. My best tip for saving money and having great skin is at-home acid peels.

My obsessed-with-running mom tries to encourage/harass me into doing a half marathon with her in a few months. I've had persistent shin splints for a while now, so I rebuff her efforts. My parents are really into this thing called FIRE (Financial Independence, Retire Early). I don't know much about it other than people who subscribe to the ideology try to save a significant amount of money in a strategic way to retire before 65. As a result, my dad regularly checks up on me by asking me how much I've contributed to my Roth IRA. It's his way of showing that he cares. I tell him I'm at $4,500. I had a $3,500 tax return this year, so I put all of it into my Roth and another $1,000 I had saved up. He is pleased with my answer, but tells me I can always do better.

It's helped my schizophrenia symptoms considerably, so I'm happy with the compromise.  $5 Advertisement 2 a.m. \u2014 My boyfriend and I stay up talking about the night.

Then I answer emails and bill my time from the previous week from my home office in order to let the dog stay outside a little longer. Usually I don't worry about our dog in the mornings because my husband works from home and takes care of her, but he's out of town today, so the morning routine is on me.

($14.92 expensed) 1 p.m. \u2014 On my flight to New York, I pay the ridiculous $34 for internet because time is money and I can't afford to be out of communication for five hours. The flight comes with \u201clunch\u201d (a.k.a. a snack) and I choose the cheese plate. It's actually a perfect pregnancy snack \u2013 hard cheese, crackers, apple slices, grapes, and almonds. ($34 expensed) 9:30 p.m. \u2014 Arrive in New York at 9:30 p.m., thanks to the time difference, and hop in a Lyft to my hotel. ($60.10 expensed) 10:30 p.m. \u2014 I'm finally at my hotel and stop by the Duane Reade next door to buy a thumb drive (I can't believe I left mine on my desk at work), the salad that least looks like it'll kill me, a Kind bar, and instant oatmeal. Then I get back to work out of my hotel room while I eat the salad (without a fork, because I forgot to buy one) and half of the Kind bar, and take my prenatal vitamins. I'm not a late-night person, and I need sleep before my deposition tomorrow, so I take my anti-nausea medication and crash at 1:15 a.m. I read a few pages of a book on my Kindle before bed \u2013 it calms my mind and helps me stop worrying about work. ($33 expensed) Advertisement Daily Total: $20", "day_two": "Day Two: 5 a.m. \u2014 I'm rudely woken up by my own alarm. I don't even want to think about what time it is at home. I've been traveling so much lately that I'm not really on a time zone at this point anyway. I eat the second half of the Kind bar that I saved from last night, take my nausea medication, and snooze for about 10 minutes. (Snoozing isn't normal for me, but I've been more tired lately, thanks to growing a human child in my body.) Then I get out of bed and answer emails before hopping in the shower. While I shower, I let the steam de-wrinkle my suit. I eat two packets of oatmeal, take my prenatal vitamins, and drink of cup of decaf coffee while I finish prepping for my deposition. At some point, my stomach decides that decaf coffee is not cool and I promptly throw up everything I've just eaten. 8:30 a.m. \u2014 Makeup and hair done, suit on, deposition outline printed (thanks hotel business center), and I'm out the door. I grab a banana from a bowl of fruit on my way out of the hotel to save for later. I walk to the opposing counsel's office, since it's a relatively nice 40 degree morning in New York. It's only half a mile away, and a walk in the fresh air is much better for my nausea than a taxi ride. 9 a.m. \u2014 Deposition time. Opposing counsel provides lunch. I eat salad and a veggie sandwich, even though I would much prefer turkey, but I can't have deli meat. I grab a cookie too, to round out the meal. Since I haven't gotten to sleep much, I drink a cup of coffee during the deposition. (I take the 200 milligram rule very seriously!) Advertisement 3:15 p.m. \u2014 I'm on my way to the airport. Halfway through the deposition I had my secretary get me on a later flight because the deposition was going longer than expected. The only flight she could book was three hours later and now I have time to kill. I would rather get to the airport and set up shop so I can work from there than spend time commuting to my company's New York office. During the car ride I have a call with one of our experts for the case. I try to keep my downtime as minimal as possible. Once I arrive at the airport, I send a couple of urgent emails before I even have a chance to go through security. ($83 expensed) 4:45 p.m. \u2014 I see that there's an earlier flight home on the same airline, so I go to the gate and request to be put on standby. There are only middle seats left, but that's completely worth it to me. And there is no change fee, so I'm not costing the firm anything. A large storm is coming into New York tonight and I want to get out of here ASAP. I work at the gate while waiting for the flight. 6 p.m. \u2014 I make it onto the earlier flight! I also keep getting alerts that my later flight is delayed due to weather, and I'm very happy I got to the airport early and asked to switch. I do regret not having the chance to grab food in the airport, but I eat the banana I hoarded as I line up to board the flight. Once on the plane, the $18.99 airline wifi is atrocious, and my emails keep getting stuck in my outbox. I can't connect to my VPN, so I do as much work as I can without having access to my firm network. It's painful to be on a five and a half hour flight and be disconnected from my team. ($18.99 expensed) Advertisement 7 p.m. \u2014 I order a snack box with hummus, almonds, and crackers on the flight. ($9.95 expensed) 9:20 p.m. \u2014 I answer a few emails at the airport that I didn't get while on the plane and grab a Starbucks breakfast sandwich to eat on my way out. I would normally just wait until I get home to eat, but lack of food leads to nausea. ($4.63 expensed) 10 p.m. \u2014 I make it home after an entirely too-chatty Lyft ride. I'll still tip and give her 5 stars, but I did not need to know about her Tinder experiences. I crash into bed with my husband after sending a couple of emails and taking my prenatal vitamins and nausea medication. I'm so happy to be home. ($48 expensed) Daily Total: $0", "day_three": "Day Three: 6 a.m. \u2014 My alarm is not my friend today. I snuggle with my husband for 10 minutes because I haven't seen him in five days. I wish I could sleep in and have him make me breakfast, but no rest for the weary. Before dragging myself out of bed, I take my nausea medication. Then I finally get up to shower and get ready for work while eating half a granola bar. I listen to a podcast while getting ready. I also spend a little time with our cat, who has been unhappy with all my travel. 7 a.m. \u2014 Out the door. I buy a bagel on my way to work because oatmeal does not sound appetizing. I'm in the office and working by 7:30 a.m. I take my prenatal vitamins \u2013 I keep a bottle at the office and a bottle at home because I take them in the morning and at night with food.  $2.95 Advertisement 9:30 a.m. \u2014 I break down and drink a half-decaf, half-regular coffee from the office machine. A meeting was cancelled, so we have bagels and muffins in the kitchen. I grab half a muffin because I'm already hungry. I should have had protein this morning rather than just carbs to keep me full longer. 11:30 a.m. \u2014 I take half an hour to run to Mendocino Farms to pick up a salad and a side of spicy potato salad for lunch. I'll eat half of the potato salad and save the rest for an afternoon snack. The food is way overpriced there, but I haven't spent much money this week, so I splurge a little for the convenience factor. I'm so impressed by people who meal prep and bring their lunches to work. I'm lucky if I remember to bring leftovers from whatever my husband prepared for dinner the night before. I eat the salad at my desk as I get back to billing.  $16.95 1:30 p.m. \u2014 Time for a coffee nap. Half-caffeinated coffee followed by 15 minutes laying on a yoga mat in my office. It takes about that long for the caffeine to hit my system, and in the meantime I can relax my body and my mind. 2:30 p.m. \u2014 I eat the second half of my potato salad while working. 4 p.m. \u2014 One of the secretaries gives me an apple from her backyard for a snack. She's so sweet and always shares her fresh fruit. Advertisement 5:10 p.m. \u2014 I make the horrendous mistake of going to the pharmacy to pick up my nausea prescription ($40) right around the time most people get off work. It should take 20 minutes, and instead takes 40. I grab milk and a few apples while I'm there to keep at the office ($4.78).  $44.78 7 p.m. \u2014 I make a green shake to eat at my desk while working. My work is never-ending and I'm uncomfortable in the pencil skirt I wore to work, so I decide to drive home at 7:15 and finish working from my home office. 7:40 p.m. \u2014 I'm back to billing from the comfort of my home, wearing pajamas as my husband makes turkey tacos. My husband typically does the grocery shopping and the majority of the cooking because he works from home. Back when we only had one car, I took on the grocery responsibilities, but I finally leased my car after four years of living in California. It's a splurge (my family thinks a car is \u201cnew\u201d if it's less than 10 years old), but I love it, and my husband was going stir crazy in San Diego without a dedicated car of his own. I take a quick break from work to watch TV with my husband on the couch.  Schitt's Creek  is so good. Then I work from the home office until 2 a.m. Daily Total: $64.68", "day_four": "Day Four: 6 a.m. \u2014 Up with my alarm. I would sleep in, but I have a 6:30 a.m. call with people on the East Coast and no time to lose today. I take a quick shower and am logged onto my computer in the home office by 6:25. I eat a couple of pieces of Hawaiian bread while taking my call. It isn't a real breakfast, but hopefully it'll stave off my hunger-induced nausea. Advertisement 7:10 a.m. \u2014 I take nausea medication and make a quick scramble of eggs, spinach, leftover turkey meat, and cheese while getting ready for work. It's an unusual combination, but I need the protein and my iron levels have been low despite the prenatal vitamins. I spend the extra two minutes putting on under-eye concealer (not part of my typical makeup routine) because I look like death today from the lack of sleep. 8 a.m. \u2014 I'm out the door an hour later than normal, so traffic is heavy. I get into the office at 8:30, grab a half-caf coffee from the office machine, and immediately get to work. I have another call in half an hour. I eat a banana I brought from home after the call. 11:45 a.m. \u2014 I take a half hour break to get a shrimp bowl from Rubio's. I eat it at my desk while working.  $10.29 3 p.m. \u2014 After a midday filing I need a little pick-me-up, so I drive to Starbucks and get a chai latte. I get an extra one for the secretary who has been busting her butt for us on this case. Sometimes after a particularly brutal midnight filing I'll give each of the secretaries a bottle of wine as a thank you. They aren't compensated nearly as well as attorneys and they have to deal with high-stress situations all the time.  $9.20 4:30 p.m. \u2014 I eat an apple with a sizable portion of Nutella, which I keep in a dedicated food drawer in my desk for days like today. Advertisement 6 p.m. \u2014 My brain is no longer working and I have more work to do, so I head home to switch into comfortable clothes and work from there. I pick up Thai food for dinner (since my husband is out watching basketball with friends) and take a break watching trashy TV while I eat. I'm back to working by 8 p.m.  $19.50 9:30 p.m. \u2014 I can only stay focused until about 9:30, so I take my nausea medication, eat half a granola bar, and quit for the night. My husband gets home about the time I'm slipping into bed with a book and we chat for a bit while I fall asleep. He knows I'm exhausted and doesn't try to keep me up too long, but it's good to spend time with him during this crazy week. Daily Total: $38.99", "day_five": "Day Five: 5 a.m. \u2014 I wake up an hour earlier than normal because I didn't get nearly as much done as I needed to last night. I'm working by 5:20, but unfortunately another fire drill pops up for the case that has been monopolizing my time, and I have to shift focus to that from the case I was planning to work on. While working, I make avocado toast for breakfast with an avocado from the tree in my backyard. One of the many reasons I love living in Southern California. Then I take a quick shower and switch over to working on another case. 7 a.m. \u2014 So much for the avocado toast. I forgot to take the nausea medication this morning and now I really regret that. I lay back in bed for about 20 minutes to feel better after throwing up breakfast. Then I eat a banana and get back to work. Advertisement 10:30 a.m. \u2014 I take a 10-minute break to eat an apple and hang out in the backyard with my husband and our dog. We bought a tiny house on a large lot (large for San Diego) and the backyard is my happy place. 11:30 a.m. \u2014 I eat my leftover Thai food for lunch while working. By noon, I'm exhausted, so I lay down for 45 minutes before we have to go to our ultrasound. Work can wait for a bit. 12:45 p.m. \u2014 My husband and I drive to the ultrasound separately because I need to go into the office afterwards. Ultrasounds are amazing. Our little girl is only three inches long, and yet we can see her stubby little fingers and toes and hear her heartbeat! Everything looks good, which is a relief because I've been feeling so awful lately. We get a couple copies of the best print-out to give to our parents. There is no copay at the appointment \u2013 thanks, insurance! 2 p.m. \u2014 I pick up a Crunchwrap from Taco Bell on my drive into work. Yes, I love Taco Bell. And yes, as a native Southern Californian I am aware that it is not \"real Mexican food.\u201d I also happen to love real Mexican food, but sometimes a girl's gotta eat a Crunchwrap with about five packets of that Taco Bell hot sauce. I work at the office for the afternoon. I head out at 6:30 p.m.,  knowing I have more work to do, but I plan to finish up working at the kitchen counter while hanging out with my husband.  $3.95 Advertisement 7 p.m. \u2014 I work while my husband grills chicken and makes baked potatoes. After dinner, we watch NCAA basketball until I'm about ready to pass out at 10. Daily Total: $3.95", "day_six": "Day Six: 7:30 a.m. \u2014 I wake up and answer emails on my phone while lazing in bed. At around 9, my husband makes chorizo breakfast burritos while I work. I add avocado and tomato from our garden to my burrito. After breakfast, my husband and I sit outside to enjoy the nice weather. This turns into me falling asleep on the outdoor couch for a nice half-hour nap. 12:30 \u2014 I take the dog on her favorite hike close by our house. I haven't had a chance to work out all week and I know I'm supposed to stay active during pregnancy. After the hike my husband makes chicken Caesar wraps with the leftover grilled chicken while I (surprise!) work. And then our neighbors stop by to drop off fresh eggs from their chickens! I plan to make lemon bars for them using lemons from our backyard as a thank you. 2 p.m. \u2014 My husband and I go down our little beach town's main street to walk around. I buy two wrap dresses from a local boutique that will fit as my belly grows.  $158 3 p.m. \u2014 We stop by our favorite bar to watch NCAA basketball. He has two beers and I have a root beer.  $20 4:30 \u2014 I need a snack, so I buy toast with hummus, lemon, olive oil, arugula, and cucumbers from a caf\u00e9 nearby.  $5.50 Advertisement 5 p.m. \u2014 Some friends invite us over for dinner of tri-tip, roasted homegrown root vegetables, and sweet potatoes. Absolutely delicious! And I get to tell them about the baby, which is very fun. 8:30 p.m. \u2014 Our friends are going to a show at a local music venue, which we were also supposed to attend, but we waited too long to buy tickets and now it's sold out. (I'm not-so-secretly happy not to be going to the show, because I am absolutely exhausted.) We drive home while they Uber to the venue. Once our friends get there, they find someone selling a ticket and buy it for my husband, so I get back in the car and drop him off at the venue. (He pays them back, $30.) With work and the pregnancy, I haven't been up for staying out late, so I'm glad when my husband goes out without me.

I plan on being lazy today; watching Netflix while working. I remember to take my nausea medication right when I wake up, and eat a Hawaiian roll to keep my stomach happy. 8:30 a.m. \u2014 I eat a banana and a couple of pieces of toast while watching  Love  on Netflix and working. At noon I can no longer keep my eyes open, so I take a nap. I sleep until 1:30, which is longer than I meant to sleep, but after this week, I think my body needs it. I wake up to several urgent emails and get back to work. Advertisement 3 p.m. \u2014 I need ingredients for the lemon bars, so I head to the grocery store. Buy Buy Baby is in the same complex and my mother and sister have been hounding me to look into baby registries, so I walk through and get immediately overwhelmed. That place is a nightmare. I'll be doing all of my baby shopping online, thanks. At the grocery store I get powdered sugar and baking powder, plus everything else we need for the week: milk, chicken, cucumbers, romaine lettuce, carrots, potatoes, mixed greens, ground turkey, tortillas, cheese, bread, pickles, veggie burgers, and ham. It's amazing how inexpensive groceries can be when you aren't buying any wine.  $86 5 p.m. \u2014 My husband picks lemons from our tree and juices them for me as I prepare the crust for the lemon bars. I love baking, but I love it even more when someone else does the hard part like juice a million tiny lemons for lemon bars or peel apples for a pie. I finish up baking the lemon bars but they need to set before I can arrange them. By the time they set, it's too late to bring over to the neighbors (they have little kids who go to bed early), so I'll have my husband run them over tomorrow while I'm at work. While I bake, my husband brings in the mail. One of my best friends from college sent me a hilarious card and a onesie from our favorite podcast \u2013  My Favorite Murder ! I text her immediately to tell her how much I look forward to putting our little girl in the \u201cSweet Baby Angel\u201d onesie. Advertisement 7 p.m. \u2014 My husband cooks peanut chicken while I work. Then we snuggle on the couch and watch the new episode of  Silicon Valley  followed by  Altered Carbon  on Netflix and then  Barry  on HBO. I'm not sold on  Altered Carbon , but I'm immediately into  Barry . By 10:30 p.m., the Sunday scaries have officially set in and I'm not looking forward to another busy week.

My husband worked all weekend, so he's off today and still asleep. I was gone for the holiday weekend, and my flight didn't get in until 10 last night, so I haven't seen much of him. He wakes up before I leave, so we talk for a few minutes before I rush out the door. I grab a Larabar and a LaCroix on my way out but plan to come home for lunch. 7:30 a.m. \u2014 Traffic seems worse than usual today, but I swing by Smoothie King for a smoothie on the way and still make it to my desk by 7:45.

I pop in my headphones for true crime podcast adventures and get to work on spreadsheets.  $6.48 3:15 p.m. \u2014 I'm finally done with my meetings for the day and can sit and focus on my work. I still have a ton of work to do and I'm hoping to get out of here on time, so I grab a package of cheese crackers out of the community snack basket and try to get work knocked out.

I spend time unwinding on the couch with my husband, D., watching  Wheel of Fortune.  I'm normally really good about meal planning and shopping on the weekends, but since I was out of town this weekend, I'm feeling way behind. I microwave a sweet potato and eat it with leftover chicken and avocado and figure out what we're going to eat the rest of the week. 8 p.m. \u2014 Grocery list in hand, I make my way to Aldi. I don't usually buy meat at Aldi, but I like their produce and pantry staples, and it's less than 10 minutes from my house. We have a second fridge/freezer in our garage, so I like to stock up on protein when it's on sale. I buy avocados, grapes, broccoli crowns, strawberries, blackberries, bell peppers, celery, dried fruit, sweet potatoes, bananas, two 15-packs of berry LaCroix, oatmeal, and two pints of Blue Bell ice cream. We try to eat paleo at home about 80% of the time, so most of what I buy fits into that lifestyle, but sometimes a girl just needs ice cream.  $35.32 8:45 p.m. \u2014 After Aldi, I run next door to Target to buy four boxes of Kleenex (it's allergy time in Texas, y'all), cold brew coffee concentrate for D., and two packages of sparkling water.

I make myself a fancy breakfast of two rice cakes with almond butter and eat it while I get a head start on emails for the day. 8:15 a.m. \u2014 I roll into the office and start working through emails and accounting entries for the end of the month while I catch up on episodes of  Wine & Crime . 10 a.m. \u2014 My boss sends a reminder about the baby shower we're hosting for a coworker next week, and I volunteer to order the cake. This also reminds me I need to get a gift, so I buy a Boppy pillow from her registry. Thankfully, I remember I still have a Bed Bath & Beyond gift card from our wedding two years ago, and it covers the pillow ($42.14), with $35 left over. 11:45 a.m. \u2014 I come to a good stopping point on my work, so I take advantage of the break and eat my lunch: a salad I made with spring mix, beets, goat cheese, walnuts, jicama, and leftover chicken.

I don't book anything now, but might later tonight after talking to D. 5:45 p.m. \u2014 I'm a few minutes early for this meeting, and I'm hungry, but the only thing around is a Sonic, so I stop for tater tots and a cherry limeade.  $4.35 8:15 p.m. \u2014 I get home from the meeting and graze on some fruit.

I usually eat at my desk or go home for lunch, but once a week I go to the south side of town to get allergy shots at my doctor's office and usually treat myself to lunch somewhere I might not normally go around there. Today I go to a gyro spot that I haven't been to in a few months and get a gyro salad and an apple fritter ($10.45). Since they're close to closing, the woman gives me two fritters for the price of one. I eat my salad and part of one of the fritters before getting my shots. The shots are around $13 out of pocket each week, but I only pay the bill every six weeks or so, and I just paid last week, so no charge today.  $10.45 Advertisement 2:45 p.m. \u2014 I'm back at my desk and back to work.

I like to go three to four times a week, but with random meetings and stuff in the evenings, it makes it hard. A lot of people laugh when I tell them about Jazzercise, but I've been doing it for two years and I love it. It's a super supportive environment with women of all ages and body types, and I always get a great workout. My monthly membership takes care of tonight's class. 7 p.m. \u2014 I'm home later than usual, and D. has already eaten random snacks for dinner. I planned to make one of my favorite Nom Nom Paleo recipes tonight, but it feels like too much effort, so I just cook hamburger with taco seasoning, mix in salsa, and eat it with chopped tomato, avocado, and jicama. I take stir-fry meat and chicken thighs out of the freezer to thaw for our next few dinners, clean up the kitchen, and talk to D. about Australia activities we've been researching. 8:45 p.m. \u2014 I shower and do my bedtime routine early so I can get out of our bathroom and D. can go to bed, since he'll be getting up super early again. My skin is starting to calm down after a rough couple weeks of breakouts, and I do a clay mask to help it along. Then I say goodnight to D. before I retreat to the living room to half-watch old episodes of  Law & Order  while I read this month's novel for my book club. With murders solved and the first few chapters read, I go to bed at 11 p.m. Advertisement Daily Total: $1,662.03", "day_four": "Day Four: 6:30 a.m. \u2014 I wake up before my alarm again, but this time by only a few minutes. I woke up way too early this morning when D.'s alarm went off, but fortunately went back to sleep pretty quickly. I get up, feed the dogs, and get ready for work. I slept with my hair wet last night, so it takes extra wrangling this morning to look half normal. I'm out the door by 7:30. 7:50 a.m. \u2014 I chat with a coworker before our meeting starts. I eat the second fritter from yesterday with a LaCroix I brought from home while going through emails and getting ready for the day. 11:15 a.m. \u2014 I go home for lunch and D. is there too, but has already eaten. I microwave a potato and put some of the taco meat from yesterday on it with ghee and avocado. It's super nice today, so I sit out back with the dogs and let them run around for a while before I go back to work. 4:45 p.m. \u2014 It's been a pretty standard afternoon, and now it's time to go to Jazzercise. I eat a banana for a little pre-workout fuel, and I'm out the door. 5:10 p.m. \u2014 I get horrible stomach cramps on the way to Jazzercise and think about bowing out. I have Crohn's disease, and sometimes my digestive system just doesn't feel like cooperating with my life. I pop a couple of pills, hope for the best, and manage to power through class. Advertisement 6:45 p.m. \u2014 I get home from class and start dinner. I make an easy broccoli and beef stir-fry and serve it with cauliflower rice. D. cleans up the kitchen for me while I shower and putter around the house. 9 p.m. \u2014 My back is hurting, so I lay on my acupressure mat for a while and try to stretch things out while D. and I watch  House Hunters . The mustache on the husband of this couple is insane. We check Twitter for the best reactions and crack up at some of the comments. 10 p.m. \u2014 D. goes to bed, and I watch an episode and a half of  The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel  before going to bed.

I have conference calls starting at 8, so I'm out the door before 7:30. 7:40 a.m. \u2014 I get to work and find out that one of my early calls is cancelled, so that's one less thing to worry about! 10:30 a.m. \u2014 I'm already hungry and have an appointment over lunch, so I eat a banana I brought from home and a Reese's egg my coworker brought me. 11:15 a.m. \u2014 I leave work and go to Home Depot to buy supplies for a painting project I'm heading up tomorrow with my church and Habitat for Humanity. I pay $16.97, which will be reimbursed. ($16.97 expensed) 12:15 p.m. \u2014 I have an appointment with my bikini waxer that I already paid for. I leave a tip.  $10 Advertisement 1:oo p.m. \u2014 I go to Costco to order a cake for my coworker's baby shower next week.

(We drink a LOT of flavored water at our house.)  $72.19 1:30 p.m. \u2014 I still haven't eaten, and I need to get back to work, so I stop at Chick-fil-A and get a nugget meal with fries and a Coke.  $6.59 3:30 p.m. \u2014 My boss and I have been collecting money to buy a gift for my coworker's shower next week. I walk around and do a last call for contributions to the group gift. We've collected over $300, so I think we did pretty well. 4:45 p.m. \u2014 I've wrapped up everything I needed to get done this week, and it's pretty quiet around the office, so I bounce for the weekend! 6:30 p.m. \u2014 D. and I watch  Wheel of Fortune  while I make dinner. I bake chicken breaded in ground-up plantain chips and roast potatoes. I manage to burn my hand on one of the oven racks when I take the potatoes out and have to run water over it for a while. I can tell it's going to blister and scar, but at least dinner is good. 8:30 p.m. \u2014 D. is working all weekend and has to be up at 4 a.m., so he goes to sleep in the guest room, and I stay up watching TV. I have to be up early, so I go to bed around 11. Advertisement Daily Total: $88.78", "day_six": "Day Six: 6 a.m. \u2014 Strong winds woke me up throughout the night. I get up, feed the dogs, bundle up, and load up all the supplies for painting the house. 7:15 a.m. \u2014 I'm out the door and on my way across town to paint this house. It's 35 degrees and windy, so I'm hoping people show up. I stop at McDonald's on the way for a sausage McGriddle and a hash brown.  $4.33 10:30 a.m. \u2014 Luckily, plenty of volunteers turn up for the paint project despite it being near freezing and extremely windy, and we get in done in just over two hours. The homeowner is so grateful. One of the other volunteers brought a ton of snacks and gives me a bunch of leftover breakfast tacos to take home. 11:30 a.m. \u2014 I get home and take a hot shower to warm up after the cold morning. I throw in a load of laundry, warm up two of the breakfast tacos for lunch, and then get ready to go on to my next volunteer activity for the day. 12:30 p.m. \u2014 I'm on my way to volunteer for a prom dress boutique for a women's organization I'm part of and as I'm waiting at a stop light, I give a homeless man on the corner a few dollars and granola bars I keep in my car. We talk about the weather until the light changes.  $2 3 p.m. \u2014 I'm done with volunteer project #2 for the day, and head back home. I think about going to the grocery store but I'm totally wiped out, so I just stop at CVS to buy knockoff ZzzQuil for D. and head home. I move the laundry from earlier to the dryer, stick in another load, and lay down for a quick nap before D. gets home.  $11.99 Advertisement 5 p.m. \u2014 I'm back up and fold the first round of laundry and wait for D. to get home. We both put on several layers of clothes and bundle up to spend a few hours outside at the Fort Worth Food + Wine Festival. 6 p.m. \u2014 There's unlimited craft beer from local breweries and food from over a dozen local restaurants while local bands play. Quite a few of our friends are here, so we socialize and try amazing burgers and beer.

I eat two more of the leftover tacos from yesterday and head over. 10:30 a.m. \u2014 I'm on two different committees for church and they both happen to meet today, one before the service, and one after. 12:30 p.m. \u2014 I go to Buy Buy Baby to buy a group baby gift with the money I collected from my coworkers. I buy a $300 gift card, a few smaller things from her registry, and cards for everyone to sign. ($331.01 expensed) 1 p.m. \u2014 I wanted to go to a local salad place for lunch, but it's super packed and I can't even find a spot in the parking lot, so I decide to skip it and just move on to my next errand: Trader Joe's. I don't come to TJ's super often, but there are certain products I always buy here and stock up on. I buy four bottles of cold brew concentrate for D., plantain chips, Chomps, a few packs of frozen rice, peanut puffs, blood oranges, two pre-packed salads to eat for lunch during the week, face oil, and vitamin E to put on my burn from Friday. I eat one of the Chomps and the peanut puffs in the car while I drive to my next stop.  $82.38 Advertisement 1:30 p.m. \u2014 I go to Sprouts to buy the rest of our groceries for the week. I pick up a package of chicken thighs, a whole chicken, romaine lettuce, grapes, apples, clementines, bananas, red onions, bell peppers, zucchini, tomatoes, avocado, mushrooms, watermelon, and almonds and mixed nuts from the bulk bins.  $59 2:15 p.m. \u2014 It's been raining a lot lately, so my car is long overdue for a wash. I stop to get a deluxe wash and interior vacuum.  $12 2:30 p.m. \u2014 I run home, unload my groceries, and change out of my church clothes. I have just enough time to cut up the chicken thighs and stick them in a citrus herb marinade before I have to run out the door for a massage appointment. 4:15 p.m. \u2014 I'm done with my massage and feeling a lot better. The massage is covered by a prepaid monthly package I bought, but I leave an $18 tip. I'm feeling super relaxed but also pretty drowsy, and I have a lot of chores left to do, so I stop at Starbucks for a chai frappuccino. I don't drink coffee or really much caffeine at all, but when I do, I go for tea. I use my rewards on my Starbucks card to cover it.  $18 5:30 p.m. \u2014 D. gets home from work just in time to watch the last bit of the Masters. I take the chicken I marinated earlier and chop up bell peppers, red onion, mushrooms, and zucchini to  make kabobs. D. smokes them on our Traeger while I clean up the kitchen and put laundry away. We eat dinner together, and then I catch up on work emails. I'll be out of office for the next two days attending trainings, so I am trying to prevent myself from getting too far behind while I'm out.

I order a three-egg omelet with spinach, mushrooms, light cheese, and home fries. My husband orders the full breakfast with French toast, over easy eggs, bacon, sausage, and a side of ham. My daughter has a chocolate chip pancake with a side of pineapple. This place isn't the same as it used to be; I'm not sure my eggs were even real. I hope I remember this the next time my husband suggests we come here. Oh well, at least my two cups of coffee were included in the meal.  $50 9:45 a.m. \u2014 I take a shower and exfoliate using a coffee scrub I bought a few weeks ago from Target. This is the third time I've used it, and it looks like I can get one more shower out of it. Yay! 10:30 a.m. \u2014 We drive 20 minutes to a horse barn in New Hampshire so my daughter can go to her riding lesson. We usually don't go on Sundays, but my daughter has to make up a missed lesson. Advertisement 11:15 a.m. \u2014 We take our dog to the dog park. We come here about once a week, and I know most of the other dogs' names. 12:15 p.m. \u2014 Back to the horse barn. It usually takes my daughter an hour to ride and another hour to tack/untack the horses. Sundays are typically faster though, and she'd been begging us to come back to see her ride. I don't feel like going, but this is what it means to be a parent. 12:45 p.m. \u2014 We stop on the way home at a mini-market because my daughter wants snacks. She grabs peanut M&Ms for me, a pack of gum and a soda for her dad, and Skittles for herself. It's all junk, but it's the weekend, so we let her have what she wants.  $8.50 1:30 p.m. \u2014 At home, I have a mini-argument with my husband about what we're going to eat this week. Basically, neither of us feels like grocery shopping. We really need to do this on Saturdays, so we can have Sundays to just chill, but we never seem to make that work, so here we are. 2:30 p.m. \u2014 We agree on the list and head to Whole Foods. My husband thinks WF is a scam, but I do feel like the taste/quality is better there. We buy organic cauliflower, carrots, chips, bananas, mangos, apple, pears, strawberries, mushrooms, white potatoes, spinach, mandarin oranges, romaine lettuce, an heirloom tomato, two pounds of gulf shrimp (I won't eat any other kind, the imported stuff is slimy to me), bone-in chicken breast, two packages of pre-seasoned chicken breast, organic yogurt, chicken stock, chicken demi-glace, organic mozzarella cheese, and three cans of Steaz iced tea. I also buy nori to make homemade avocado rolls at home for my daughter.  $151.95 Advertisement 3 p.m. \u2014 Next stop is Target. We buy two Nivea lotions (we don't share lotion), laundry pods, fabric softener, dryer sheets, toothpaste, and a new muffin pan (since I turned my old one into a game for our dog). Also, since my husband really doesn't want to go to our local grocery store, we end up buying Smartfood, Goldfish, gummy candies, potato chips, Oreos, bagels, donuts, and LaCroix ($50). I'm annoyed, because it is so much more expensive than it would be at our local Market Basket, where most snacks are two for $5, but I'm not feeling up to the going to a third store either.  $174.18 3:30 p.m. \u2014 Come home and start to put the groceries away. My husband empties out all the bags, and I put the stuff away. I always feel like I get the short end of the stick here, but when he's not home, and I put the stuff away, it does feel like way more work, so maybe he's actually helping. 4 p.m. \u2014 I put half of the rice in the rice cooker so I can make my daughter her avocado sushi rolls. I also make egg muffin bites for breakfast for the week. 5 p.m. \u2014 My daughter wants me to watch  The Hunger Games  with her (only for the thousandth time), and I feel like I haven't spent too much time with her lately, so I head to the basement to our mini-home theater (three seats and an old projector) to watch the movie. Advertisement 7 p.m. \u2014 Come back upstairs to heat up leftover pho from Tuesday, which we made in our Crock-Pot. Our big goal lately has been to spend less money on eating out and to cook dinner at home most nights of the week. 7:45 p.m. \u2014 I fold a load of laundry and then sit on the couch for a little me time. I let my husband wash the dishes. We follow the \"cook doesn't clean up\" rule as much as possible. He usually gets the short end of the stick here, because I make a huge mess in the kitchen most of the time. But tonight it isn't too bad. 8:45 p.m. \u2014 I get an email from my library that an ebook I put on loan is ready. Sweet, right in time to read before bedtime. No matter how tired I am, I always try to read for 15 minutes or more at night. It's the only time I can wind down and start to shut my mind down. 9 p.m. \u2014 Tidy up the house and head upstairs to bed. I can't settle into a book that I like tonight, so I scroll through social media and organize my paperless lists. I need to find a good book soon. 10 p.m. \u2014 Lights out.

She's an early riser, but we made a rule that she has to stay in bed (she chooses ours) until Dad leaves at 5 a.m. for work. Then she can go downstairs, watch YouTube, and play with the dog until it's time to get ready at 6:30 a.m. Advertisement 6:30 a.m. \u2014 I end up oversleeping at bit, but it's okay since I don't have to wash my hair. I take a quick shower while my daughter packs her lunch and eats her breakfast. 7 a.m. \u2014 Microwave two egg muffin bites and pack a yogurt with mango and strawberries. Put a load of laundry in the washer right before we leave. 7:20 a.m. \u2014 Now we're running late. Good thing my daughter's school is only five minutes away. 7:25 a.m. \u2014 Fight the school drop off line. This is the stuff memes are made of. 7:30 a.m. \u2014 Stop at the local coffee shop for my daily cappuccino. My husband calls me as I'm driving, and we talk over Bluetooth. He did the math for me on how much I spend on coffee a year, so we're talking about buying an espresso machine, but I have yet to decide on the model I want. The cheapest one I can find that will make a decent cappuccino is over $500.  $4 9 a.m. \u2014 Squeak into the parking lot near my office. If you get in before 9:05, it's $24 for the day. Anything later is at least $40. Sometimes I take the bus, but I've been working late the past couple of months, so I've been driving most days.  $24 9:15 a.m. \u2014 Grab my mobile order from Starbucks. Venti black iced tea with three pumps of sugar. I really need to break this habit of two drinks in the morning. I'm always thirsty from my cappuccino, and even though I fill up a thermos with water and keep it in my car, the iced tea always hit the spot.  $3.24 Advertisement 10 a.m. \u2014 Email with our director to talk about changes to our website. I have a year-round intern, so she and I split up the task. We've been incredibly lucky to hire good interns. They are always worth their weight in gold. 11 a.m. \u2014 Answering emails and meetings all morning. I have another meeting in 30 minutes, so I eat the yogurt and fruit I brought from home. 11:45 a.m. \u2014 I order a Kale Caesar salad from Sweetgreen to pick up at 1 p.m. after my meeting.  $10.65 1:15 p.m. \u2014 The meeting went 15 minutes longer than planned, but I'm still able to eat lunch with my coworkers before my 2 p.m. meeting. We're a small office, and we usually all eat lunch together. There is a huge variety in age amongst my coworkers, which makes for diverse conversation, from the Kardashians to grandbabies. 2 p.m. \u2014 Important meeting with the directors where we walk through an upcoming event. I speak up a few times but feel like I could have contributed more. 4:45 p.m. \u2014 Leave the office to head to the parking garage. I know traffic is not going to be pretty heading home. 5 p.m. \u2014 My coworker calls me to talk about work and her recent vacation. We're friends outside of the office, too. 6:15 p.m. \u2014 Come home to my husband working out on the Peloton bike. He did a 60-minute ride and is dripping in sweat. For dinner, we reheat meatballs, and he boils gluten-free pasta for me and angel hair for him. I make my daughter an avocado sushi roll per her request and she eats a banana and strawberries for dinner. Advertisement 7 p.m. \u2014 Finish dinner, and my husband agrees to do the dishes so I can take a much-needed shower. I usually take two showers a day, which is a waste of water, but I feel like it's necessary. I sweat a lot. 7:30 p.m. \u2014 My daughter wants me to watch the pilot episode of  Empire  with her. She was too young when it came out in 2015, and she is probably too young now, but she unfortunately sees worse on YouTube. I'm not big on censoring her music or movies, but there are plenty of shows and movies we don't think she should watch. 8:30 p.m. \u2014 Check Mint to see what we've purchased today. My husband typically buys lunch because his job requires him to visit several hospitals and clinics over the week, and he's often traveling between campuses during the day. 9 p.m. \u2014 Upstairs to relax in bed before lights out. I'm reading  The Saturday Evening Girls Club  by a local author. 10 p.m. \u2014 Lights out. Daily Total: $41.89", "day_three": "Day Three: 5 a.m. \u2014 I sleep through my husband's 4:30 alarm \u2013 thank God! But my daughter crawls into bed with me at 5 a.m. to snuggle. The thing I miss the most about not having a kid is sleep. I dream about the days when I could sleep until noon or sneak into work late because I slept until 8:30. 6:30 a.m. \u2014 Today is my work-from-home day, so I don't have to rush. I still get up and get dressed, though. I know some people can work at home in their pajamas, but that doesn't work for me. I check email while my daughter gets ready for school. The best part of parenting an 11-year-old is that she can do most tasks by herself. She asks me to make her a bagel for breakfast while she packs her lunch. Usually I don't have time, but since it's my work-from-home day, I happily toast her bagel. Advertisement 7:20 a.m. \u2014 Drop off the dog at doggie daycare. Our dog goes twice a week. If she doesn't, she tears the house apart on the days she is home alone. It's $25 a visit, but I can drop off at 7 a.m. and pick up at 7 p.m. I consider it money well spent. My husband and I have been discussing dropping the dog walking service we've had since our dog was eight-weeks-old. By the fall, our daughter will be old enough to come straight home from school, so the dog will be left alone at home for less time, and we'll save $60 bucks a week. 7:25 a.m. \u2014 Drop off my daughter and head for our local coffee shop for my morning cappuccino.  $4 8 a.m. \u2014 Work call with our Accounts Payable person. She's a friend, so the call turns into a personal chat about how everything is going with her. 9 a.m. \u2014 I scrub our websites for broken links. I do this every week, so there aren't too many to fix. My desktop and MacBook both need updates, so I update them and decide to take a shower while I'm waiting. I shave my legs quickly and nick my leg (ouch!). 9:30 a.m. \u2014 Back on email. Working on the updates per our meeting yesterday. Receive an email about an upcoming PSA we are doing. The best part of working at a nonprofit is the opportunity to do a lot of different things, since resources are limited. But there's always more work to do. If only I had another 12 hours in a day. Or didn't need to sleep. Advertisement 10 a.m. \u2014 Snack on organic yogurt and homemade granola with cranberries, walnuts, and almond slivers (yum!). I made the granola last week, and my husband sliced strawberries on Sunday. If we buy a quart of strawberries and don't slice them right away, no one seems to eat them, and the whole expensive organic mold mess gets trashed. 10:30 a.m. \u2014 Get an email from my friend at work with a Groupon offer for an indoor water park for school vacation week. Since it's a busy time for me at work, my husband has to take time off next week to take care of our daughter. This is a new development: While he was in the military, it was out of the question for him to take time off. He was away most of the time at training, or deployed. It's definitely been an adjustment, but this is one of the perks. I buy two tickets for $22 each for next Friday.  $44.19 11:30 a.m. \u2014 Conference call with the entire team. We have a fairly new director, and her leadership style is toxic. It's mostly me listening in on the phone on mute, so I drink a LaCroix. 12:15 p.m. \u2014 Check the mail after my conference call is over. Our dog's Bullymake Box arrives today, and we get charged for it. It has a toy with bacon on it, plus a new cosmic ball, a Kong shaped like a grenade, and a nylon chew toy shaped like a fidget spinner.  $39 Advertisement 12:30 p.m. \u2014 Also in the mail is a Mini Boden catalogue. My daughter is almost too old/tall for much of their clothes, but they also have a line for older girls called Johnnie B. I buy her two rompers and a three-pair pack of underwear. I use the 20% off code on the back of the catalogue. We're trying to limit spending on clothing to no more than $300 a month for the whole family. I can go a little crazy when it comes to my daughter's wardrobe, but I stay in control today.  $94.40 1:30 p.m. \u2014 I fold a load of laundry and vacuum the first floor of our house. We buy the house a Christmas present every year, and last year it was two Dyson vacuums: one cordless for the hardwood downstairs, and one upright for the carpet. Honestly, I use the cordless the most and I know I'll buy another one when this one dies. 3 p.m. \u2014 I start an early dinner since I didn't eat lunch and my husband is on his way home early today. I make bone-in chicken breasts with demi-glace, mashed potatoes, spinach with Parmesan cheese, and mushrooms with garlic. Great meal, and the best part is: My husband has clean-up duty! 4:30 p.m. \u2014 My husband cannot stop laughing because I received an email from thredUp that my items were received and I'm getting a whopping $14.95. I sent jeans with tags on them from Kut from the Kloth, Hudson, Henry & Belle, and Liverpool, so I am not happy. I knew the risk, but needless to say, I won't be using thredUp again. Advertisement 5 p.m. \u2014 Pick up the doggo from daycare. 6 p.m. \u2014 I was supposed to go over to my friend's house for an early week wine night (we typically meet on Thursdays), but she received some really bad news about her mom, so we reschedule. I head down to my basement to get in a workout on the Peloton. Alex Toussaint is calling my name. 45 minutes later, I'm feeling a lot more energized. 7 p.m. \u2014 My mom calls me just as I end my ride. We chat about her errands and work. She raised me and my two brothers without help from our father, and she doesn't make a lot of money, so I help her out when I can. It's her birthday this week, and all she wants is new clothes. I buy her new bras and underwear from Victoria Secret ($172.50), plus two pairs of work pants from Old Navy ($84.23). I use promo codes on both purchases.  $256.73 7:30 p.m. \u2014 My daughter requests another avocado roll. I ask my husband to make the rice, and twenty minutes later I roll one for us and one for her. 8 p.m. \u2014 Fold another load of laundry. It really is endless when you have a house, dog, and child. Clean up after said dog and child: toys for the dog, various cups and snacks for the babe. 8:30 p.m. \u2014 I take a shower, then go through my nightly skincare ritual. I use Bioelements foaming wash, Crucial Moisture, eye cream, and serum. It's old school, but my aesthetician uses all their products, and I think they work for me. Advertisement 9 p.m. \u2014 TMI ahead, but we've been married for over a decade, and we've always made sex a priority as a couple. It ebbs and flows given what's going on in our lives, but we make it a priority to reconnect physically about every three days. 10 p.m. \u2014 Lights out! Unless I'm super stressed out, I usually fall asleep very easily. Also, my husband was very giving tonight, so I drift off to weightless sleep in no time. Daily Total: $438.32", "day_four": "Day Four: 4 a.m. \u2014 OMG why is my kid up already? Go back to sleep, please. I give her permission to go downstairs, because my head is pounding. I didn't drink enough water after my Peloton workout last night. UGH. I sip water and go back to bed. 6:15 a.m. \u2014 Okay, now I officially have to get up, so of course I browse social media on my phone for few minutes and then finally crawl out of bed. I am hoping a cup of black tea will ease my aching head. 6:30 a.m. \u2014 Drink tea and eat my egg bites. I'm hungry this morning after eating an early dinner yesterday. My head hurts and I don't feel like emptying the dishwasher, so I hand wash the bowls and utensils my daughter and I used. 6:45 a.m. \u2014 My daughter asks me to make her a bagel, but I tell her I don't have time, as I have to jump in the shower. I head upstairs and notice she's made her bed, but she threw her pajamas on the ground. I fold up the pajamas while the shower heats up. We switched to a tankless water heater last year and it takes a couple minutes to heat up. We're saving water, but it always seems like such a waste to run it. I wash my hair with Kevin Murphy Angel Wash shampoo and conditioner. My hair totally changed after having my daughter \u2014 it's much thinner and finer than before, so I need something that won't weigh it down. I put Bioelements Radiance Rescue mask on my face in the shower, and then lather up with my lavender body soap from Whole Foods. Shower off, towel dry, then use Bioelements Equalizer, Crucial Moisture, eye cream, and RayDefense (SPF 30). Advertisement 7 a.m. \u2014 While getting dressed, I notice I have a run in my navy stockings. Unfortunately, it's the only pair that matches the dress I picked out. The run is above the knee and the dress goes over my knees, so I wear it anyway. I make a mental note to buy a new pair. 7:15 a.m. \u2014 Dice a mango, add sliced strawberries, and take an organic Wallaby yogurt. My daughter tells me she needs money for a book fair, so we stop by the ATM.  $30 7:30 a.m. \u2014 Head to the coffee shop after dropping off my daughter at school. I'm still feeling hungry this morning and want something sweet, so I grab a cinnamon roll.  $8 9:15 a.m. \u2014 Arrive at the office and can see our director talking to the graphic designer. That is never a good sign, and I hope today is not going to be one of those days. 11 a.m. \u2014 Ninety-minute team meeting. I bring my yogurt to eat. 1 p.m. \u2014 Head out with two coworkers for lunch. I pick up my Kale Caesar with salmon from Sweetgreen, and we head over to Chicken & Rice Guys, where my two coworkers want to eat. Suddenly my salad isn't as appealing. Sweetgreen is off their game today; my salad is only two thirds full and there are hardly any Parmesan cheese crisps (which is usually the best part).  $13.05 2 p.m. \u2014 Back to work after a great lunch of catching up with my coworkers. Advertisement 4 p.m. \u2014 Head to the parking garage and commute home. I work a longer day at home on Tuesdays so I can leave before traffic on other days. The trade off is I agree to check email every night until 8 p.m. Most nights are quiet, but when we're close to an event, it's a lot of late nights.  $24 5:30 p.m. \u2014 Arrive home and chat with my husband. It turned into a nice day, so I take the dog outside for a game of fetch. My husband and I are both in the mood for seafood takeout, so we make the order and chat for a bit. Since he gets home earlier most days, he picks up our daughter from after school and helps her with her homework. My daughter comes up to say hi, and I always feel better just seeing her smiling face. 6 p.m. \u2014 We eat. It's good, but another place that is just not the same as it used to be. My husband bought me a soda as a surprise. He knows my weakness too well. I wash the dishes from breakfast and dinner.  $45.15 6:30 p.m. \u2014 I take a shower, towel off, and lather up with lotion and oil. I see that I'm almost out of oil, so I order another bottle using my Amazon Prime subscription.  $11.95 7:30 p.m. \u2014 Hang out with the hubby while he tells me about his day. He really loves his job, but his workload is much less than when he was in the military, where he was responsible for more than 2,000 soldiers. I think he's a little bored. He wants to direct his own hospital someday. Advertisement 8 p.m. \u2014 I read a chapter of my daughter's new book,  Renegades , out loud to her. It's been a long time since she's asked me to read to her, so even though I just want to relax on the couch, I'm happy she asked. She's not feeling well, so I give her Motrin. I think it's cramps \u2014 she recently started getting her period. 10 p.m. \u2014 Stay up later than usual, thanks to the Coke. My husband wants to know what Money Diaries is all about, so I read him a few, and now he's hooked. 11 p.m. \u2014 Lights out after staying awake to watch the final episode of  America's Next Top Model . I've been watching this show since Cycle One, and it's a guilty pleasure. Daily Total: $132.15", "day_five": "Day Five: 5 a.m. \u2014 The dog is whining to go outside, so I bump my way downstairs. I really can't see much without my contacts. While I wait for the dog, I hear my daughter leave her room and climb into my bed. Her stomach still hurts, and she's feeling nauseous now. Maybe it isn't cramps. 5:30 a.m. \u2014 Since I'm up, I check out the new show  Splitting Up Together  on the Hulu app on my phone. I end up watching the first three episodes. Some of the interactions feel forced, but overall, I like it. Add the show to my Watch List. 7 a.m. \u2014 Decide to go into work late today. My husband agrees to come home early so my daughter will only be alone for a couple of hours. I make a mental note to let my neighbor know she's home, just in case. The neighbor works from home every day (dream job!) and is willing to play second mom when I'm not home. Since we have no family around, we rely on our network of friends. I hate to ask for help, so we only rely on neighbors when we have to. 7:30 a.m. \u2014 Take a shower and then wash my face and apply daily concoctions. I remember to put sunscreen on my face, neck, and chest. It's easier to wash my face in the shower, but I read it causes wrinkles because the water is usually too hot for your face. I just recently started to notice fine lines and wrinkles around my eyes. I don't love this about being 35, but I have to say I'm happier and more confident now versus 10 years ago when I had no wrinkles. 8 a.m. \u2014 I still need coffee, and my daughter rides with me to drop the dog off at daycare and pick up my cappuccino. I get a cinnamon roll again today.  $8 8:30 a.m. \u2014 I check my work email. My boss is working from home, and my intern is running late. 10:15 a.m. \u2014 Arrive at work to multiple issues that need addressing immediately. Since my boss and her boss are both out today, it's on me. I try not to panic and fix what I can.  It's not the deadline that bothers me, but the lack of clear direction. 12:45 p.m. \u2014 I pick-up my Kale Caesar from Sweetgreen. It's on point today.  $10.65 4 p.m. \u2014 Our new T-shirts for our upcoming event arrive, and I happily deliver them to everyone's desks. 4:45 p.m. \u2014 Pay for my parking and am off to fight the traffic.  $24 5:30 p.m. \u2014 Stop at Whole Foods for a slice of pizza, a can of Steaz peach tea, a Rice Krispies treat, and a bag of chocolate chip cookies for my daughter.  $12.98 6:15 p.m. \u2014 Home. I fold load of laundry, start the dishwasher, and change into yoga pants and a sweater. I have a pedicure appointment at 6:45 at my local spa. I go there for my facials and massages, too. Just the smell of the place (lavender and clean towels) makes me relax. 7:45 p.m. \u2014 My toes look great in OPI Malibu Pink, and I feel relaxed and refreshed. I buy eye cream while paying ($34).  $89 8 p.m. \u2014 Get home to check on my daughter, who still isn't feeling 100%. I put the clothes in the dryer, then throw my black Rothy's into the washer. 9 p.m. \u2014 Upstairs to bed. I try out a five-minute deep-sleep meditation app. I like it, but I think the yearly fee of $100 is a bit much. I pass out. Daily Total: $144.63", "day_six": "Day Six: 5:30 a.m. \u2014 Wake up, and my daughter is in my bed. She still doesn't feel well. I have to go into work this morning, so I text my husband to see if he can come home early. He can, so I stay in bed for a few more. 6:30 a.m. \u2014 Take a shower, do my morning skincare routine, and get dressed. Then I load the dishwasher and do a load of laundry. 7:30 a.m. \u2014 Arrive at the coffee shop and receive two texts. One from my director telling me to come into her office as soon as I get in (great!), and the other from my husband who says he has to send $200 to his niece. I'll get the full story later, as I need to drive now. I pick up a veggie wrap with eggs, spinach, feta, and caramelized onion to go along with my cappuccino.  $211 9 a.m. \u2014 Squeak into parking lot, order my Starbucks on the mobile app, pick it up, and head into work before 9:15.  $3.24 9:15 a.m. \u2014 My boss is being fired today. My director wants me to lock my boss out of all of her accounts while they're in the meeting firing her. IT takes care of her email, computer, and phone, but we have the logins to our websites and social media. 9:30 a.m. \u2014 My soon-to-be fired boss comes to my desk to chat. She worked at home yesterday and wants to talk boards for our upcoming event. I am sick to my stomach having to pretend. 10 a.m. \u2014 My boss and director go in our ED's office. It's time to start canceling stuff. It takes a lot less time than I thought. 11 a.m. \u2014 I've been hiding in a coworker's office for the past 45 minutes. Cowardly, but I really don't want the awkward goodbye. They are giving her an hour to clear her office and resign. Also, they don't want anyone talking about this. Eye roll. 12:30 p.m. \u2014 She is still here, and I need to get out of this oppressive environment of pretending. A group of us go to lunch and talk about the way things have gone downhill in the past two years. I buy a rice plate at Chicken & Rice Guys.  $8.50 3 p.m. \u2014 It's a beautiful day, and we're reluctant to go inside, but our lunch break is over. I am relieved to hear my boss has left. I feel a little annoyed at the fact they expect us to not talk about this. It's been five months of absolute chaos, and I feel shell shocked. 6 p.m. \u2014 Get home and I am annoyed to find the house is a mess. My husband has this annoying habit of opening all of the mail and then leaving it all on the counter, including mail that is clearly trash. I decide to take the dog for a walk to clear my head and enjoy the weather. My husband decides to join, and we walk over to an ice cream place near our house. I buy a scoop of mint cookie ice cream for me and a scoop of cookie dough ice cream for my daughter.  $8.50 7:30 p.m. \u2014 I'm feeling better, but then I get into a silly argument with my husband that my daughter jumps in on. He says my feet stink, and I need to do something about it. I walk away pissed, fold the laundry, empty the dishwasher, and then go up to take a bath. Lavender bath salts do the trick every time! 8:30 p.m. \u2014 Go back downstairs and order pizza for my daughter, wings for my husband, and cheesy breadsticks for me. My husband and daughter drive to the next town over to pick up the food. I stay home to enjoy alone time.  $40 9:15 p.m. \u2014 Bedtime. My hubby is putting out VIBES, but I'm tired and still stressed about the day, so I ignore them. He wants to cuddle, but I tell him I just don't have anything left in me tonight. I fall asleep fast. Daily Total: $271.24", "day_seven": "Day Seven: 7 a.m. \u2014 I get up after lying in bed for an extra 30 minutes. I feel much better this morning and we decide to get up, change the sheets, make a grocery list, and get to Whole Foods when it opens at 8. 8:15 a.m. \u2014 We make it to WF, and there are already a lot of people here. WTH. We buy strawberries, apples, pears, mandarin oranges, carrot chips, mushrooms, bananas, avocados, a bell pepper, sweet potatoes, medium carrots, bagged onions, Wallaby yogurt, frozen wild Alaskan salmon, boneless chicken thighs, chicken drumsticks, a pound of stewed beef, beef broth, frozen scallops, shrimp, clams, and calamari. I pick up another pack of nori and carrot wraps, too. I also see that my soap is on sale for $7.99 when it's usually $12.99, so I buy three bottles. I grab a coffee while my husband pays.  $203.24 9:30 a.m. \u2014 We arrive at Market Basket near our house. We buy organic celery, snow peas, Capri Sun, Oreos, chocolate chip cookies, Lucky Charms, almond milk, corn bread, tzatziki, lemonade, passion fruit juice, burrito wraps, gluten-free crackers, Cheetos, butter, whole milk, onions and tomatoes diced with cilantro, and Crystal Light (for my husband). My husband has to drink sugar-free everything. His father was just diagnosed with diabetes, so he's cut most extra sugar.  $163.60 10:15 a.m. \u2014 Get home and empty the car. Hubby volunteers to make us breakfast while I shower to get ready for yoga. It's one-on-one, and I like to feel fresh. It's nice out, so my daughter takes the dog out for a run. 11 a.m. \u2014 My daughter and I drive to her horseback riding lesson. It's my mom's birthday, so we call and wish her a happy birthday. 11:30 a.m. \u2014 Drop my daughter off at the barn. 11:45 a.m. \u2014 Arrive at the yoga studio. I've been doing one-on-one yoga for about a year and a half now. The instructor is really knowledgeable, down-to-earth, and practical at the same time. We always chat about life before we start. She's helped me work through some shit in my life. I consider it therapy and well worth the money. I pay her three visits at a time for $60 a visit. Today is my last of the three, so I buy a new set. This session is a lot of upper body work. I'm still a novice, but I can definitely see the progress I've made since I started.  $180 12:45 p.m. \u2014 Our session is done, and I head to the horse barn to pick up my daughter. 1:15 p.m. \u2014 We get home, and my husband is burning leaves in a barrel in the driveway. His attempt is not successful, and I add branch removal to my list of things to talk to the landscaping company about. 1:30 p.m. \u2014 Husband agrees to grill the pre-seasoned chicken we never got around to eating during the week. We decide to make wraps. He uses the burrito wraps, and I try the carrot ones. We both add lettuce, avocado, chicken, and shredded cheese, and I add cucumber to mine while he adds the diced onions and tomatoes to his. I add a side of chips and a pickle, and drink a LaCroix. 2 p.m. \u2014 My turn to clean up. Then I go online to return a Lululemon shirt and yoga pants. 2:30 p.m. \u2014 Taxes. We owe $12,032 to federal and $887 to California, where my husband was living and working last year. Even though we both claimed zero on our taxes last year, it still wasn't enough. This year we tripled checked the withholding calculator that the IRS sent out. It said we had to claim zero and an additional $300 each paycheck. Our overall take-home pay went down, but I cannot pay this amount again next year. I die a little inside as I put both checks in the mail. This is one of those times when being an adult sucks.  $12,919 3 p.m. \u2014 We make an appointment to speak with a financial planner my neighbor also sees. We don't know how much money we should be contributing to our 401(k)s. It's confusing, because my husband already gets a retirement from the military. I also don't know if we should be putting more towards our daughter's college fund. After all our deductions, bills, and expenses are paid, we have about $2,000 left. We don't know if we should use the extra money to pay off our car, pay off our house, invest, or something else. Both of us were raised by single moms, and though we're by no means rich, we have no one in our families who makes as much as we do. We try to talk to some of our friends about this, but most are 10 to 15 years older than us, and it's still a very taboo topic. 3:30 p.m. \u2014 We're both tired and decide to take a quick nap before we get ready to go over to our friend's house for dinner. My husband takes a 20-minute nap and I wake up and decide to keep sleeping. I Google how long to take a nap, and it says 20 or 90 minutes. Sweet, I choose 90. 5 p.m. \u2014 I wake up feeling refreshed and jump in the shower. My husband goes to the liquor store to get a bottle of chardonnay. I dress and get ready, then pull the organic carrots chips and tzatziki out of the fridge to take with us.  $15 5:40 p.m. \u2014 We're late, and I feel bad when we arrive and my friend has made a mozzarella and tomato appetizer. It's clear I didn't try very hard. 6 p.m. \u2014 Our friends make steak, roasted asparagus, and Caesar salad. We have M&Ms for dessert, then play 45s. It's a confusing game, and we are definitely amateurs. 11 p.m. \u2014 We're home and agree to \"reconnect\" tomorrow morning. 11:55 p.m. \u2014 Hubby goes to bed, and I stay up watching a friend's vlog. She's walking the Appalachian Trail, and I am in awe of her. She posts a video every few days and just crossed over to NC. I would love to do something life-changing like this, but I love of showers too much. Oh well, I can live vicariously through her.

We're an intercultural couple (I'm American, he's from North Africa and lived there until a few years ago), and we find ourselves often in these deep conversations in the evenings about how we will handle various life decisions. Some of it's tough stuff, but all of it makes us feel so much closer to each other. I wake up tired but glowing with love for this man sleeping next to me, and I cannot wait to marry him. I KNOW, very lovey dovey \u2013 but I have an excuse: I'm a Pisces and I feel ALL of the emotions. 7:30 a.m. \u2014 My cousin stayed with us last night after her flight back to California was cancelled due to yet another storm. I throw an egg on to boil while I do my makeup and drink my first cup of coffee. Once my egg is done, I peel and eat it with a few blue corn tortilla chips and hummus (weird, I know\u2026but so good!). I throw on my clothes, take the pup for a quick walk, kiss my fianc\u00e9, and I'm out the door. 9:05 a.m. \u2014 Whew, made it through the commute and I'm only five minutes late to work! My boss is extremely punctual and often gets to the office a few hours earlier than us, so when we aren't here by 9 a.m., he notices. Advertisement 12:45 p.m. \u2014 I head out to pick up my MealPal lunch, an acai bowl from a juice shop down the street. I am loving MealPal \u2013 I get to pick lunch from a nearby restaurant every day, and it's a huge money saver. The meals work out to be about $6 per lunch, which is a steal for NYC! I tried bringing my own lunch for a long time, but I've decided it's just not worth the trouble for me to take the time to meal plan on Sundays. Ain't nobody got time for that. I bring my acai back to the office and pop a handful of extra nuts in there that I bought at Duane Reade earlier this week \u2013 super delicious and filling. YUM. 4 p.m. \u2014 Coffee time. I head downstairs with my coworker to our usual afternoon two-dollar coffee spot down the block. We spend the 10 minutes away from our desks complaining about the office and wondering out loud to each other why we put ourselves through this. Whoever thinks interior design and architecture is a \u201cfun\u201d job is kidding themselves! My coworker is having a particularly bad week, so I buy his coffee and grab myself pretzels and hummus. This place is amazing \u2013 every item is exactly $2 (+ tax). We grab our stuff and head back to the office.  $6.50 6:30 p.m. \u2014 Finally wrap up the 3D model studies that I'm working on, send one last email, and head out of work to go the gym. My gym is a few blocks from my office, but I'm thinking of cancelling my membership. Now that it's almost warm enough to run outside, I want to dedicate my gym funds to a yoga studio and get my cardio in by running outside. I decided recently it would be best to streamline my practices and choose things that I can pretty much do anywhere and that make me feel good \u2013 hello, yoga and running!

We fill out a fun questionnaire from our wedding photographers about our personalities, and then peruse and refine our online registry. We're sending save-the-dates next week, so this website and registry need to be up and running. YAY wedding! We are just starting to really get into it, and we're about six months out.

I'm really trying to get back into my practice and this is just what I need to heal my muscles from running last night and to start my weekend off on the right foot! I prep my coffee for when I come home so that I can just push the button while I'm getting ready after yoga. I'm out the door by 6:50. 8:05 a.m. \u2014 Feeling amazing! Home from yoga in less than two minutes, but still in a huge rush. That's the only issue with these 7 a.m. classes. I need to throw my makeup and clothes on in record speed in order to make it to work in time. Sleepy pup is so confused by my presence \u2013 she thought I had left for the day.

Not that pregnancy would be the end of the world at this point \u2013 I'm 29, I want to have kids, and am with the man that I plan to have them with. But I'd like to have my wedding first! I already have my dress and I'm REALLY looking forward to wearing it. 6:30 p.m. \u2014 I wrap up a draft that I've been working on of the presentation we're doing next week and shoot it off to my boss. Then, I head out to go meet one of my best gals for dinner back in Brooklyn. She's one of my bridesmaids, and we've been trying to carve out time to see each other more lately. I am loving these date nights with her to get up to speed on what's going on in her equally busy life. We catch up at a sushi spot that she recommends and share appetizers, rolls, and a beer. Yum!  $37 Advertisement 9:30 p.m. \u2014 Walk home to quickly freshen up before heading out the door again with B. to meet some of his friends for drinks in the city. I prefer to take a train when I'm heading out for the night instead of Uber, knowing that I'll almost definitely take an Uber home at the end of the night after we've been drinking. 4 a.m. \u2014 Well, tonight ended up being one of those quintessential NYC nights! Lots of bar-hopping, LOTS of tequila shots, and so many laughs. B. has a few cousins here in NYC who are from his home country as well, and I've been really trying to spend more quality time with them lately, since they're my future family! Sometimes the language barrier can be awkward at first, but tonight it's no issue. The time flew by and these guys had me in stitches all night. I'm learning Arabic, so I'm starting to pick up on tiny little bits of their humor in conversation. Thankfully, most of my drinks tonight are bought by the guys, so I don't have much remorse on that front. We grab late-night bites at Mamoun's Falafel.  $30 4:30 a.m. \u2014 We Uber home and I fall asleep in the car. We crawl upstairs, I quickly take the pup outside (she is confused and thinks it's her morning walk), and then we climb into bed.  $10 Daily Total: $114.50", "day_three": "Day Three: 10 a.m. \u2014 OUCH. Oh man, the hangover is real. It takes all of my effort to get out of bed and start the day. I am not used to this \u2013 my days of staying out until 4 a.m. are few and far between, and now I remember why! But I don't regret it at all \u2013 last night was so much fun, and much needed. The promise of greasy breakfast food is motivating, so I get myself up, brush my teeth, and put on a pot of coffee. Advertisement 11 a.m. \u2014 I had woken up to a text from a former colleague asking if I would be free this weekend to help with a quick freelance project. I respond and say I can help out tomorrow. This hangover will certainly not allow for any productivity, and I have a full day today. I love when projects like this come my way with a quick turnaround \u2013 it's not a huge commitment, and it's an easy way to make some extra bucks. We wrap up the call and she sends me all of the project information. 11:30 a.m. \u2014 B. is up and ready to go (although struggling like I am), so we decide to go have brunch at the diner down the street before he goes to work. It's not the *best* food in the world, but it certainly does the trick on days like this. B. works on Saturdays and Sundays, as he is a restaurant manager, and those are the days when they need him the most. We meander down the block and grab a table. I order a Snapple, needing something sugary to quench my hangover thirst, plus fish and eggs. B. gets the same and we spend breakfast catching up about last night and talking about our dream of opening a cute little breakfast restaurant. We split the bill, I kiss B. goodbye, and then I head home.  $17 1:30 p.m. \u2014 I decide to take a quick nap because I know I have more fun ahead of me today, so I make a beeline for the couch when I get home and snuggle up with the dog. Advertisement 2:15 p.m. \u2014 Nap alarm goes off and I wish I didn't have plans today \u2013 what I would give to just relax and sleep off this hangover! But I know I have an amazing afternoon ahead of me, so I get up and get ready to head out. I'm meeting my friend to see a live taping of our favorite podcast,  Bitch Sesh , at a theater in Times Square. It's a breakdown of the  Real Housewives  franchise but it is also so much more than that. I put on an episode of the podcast and grab an iced coffee and French cruller donut at Dunkin' right outside the train station.  $4 3:30 p.m. \u2014 I arrive outside the theater on 44th and am giddy seeing all the other fans excited to see the show. I wait outside for my friend to arrive, and then we head into the theater. 4 p.m. \u2014 Well, what's a  Housewives -themed live show without wine!? We grab a couple of drinks and find our seats. This first round is on me.  $30 6 p.m. \u2014 The show is over and my friend and I are still dying over the hilarity of these women who host the show. There's another showing at 8 p.m., and we debate hiding in the storage closet to see it again, but opt instead to meet another friend for more drinks at a nearby bar. 8 p.m. \u2014 Okay, two more drinks in me and I'm ready to head home. It was so much fun hanging with the boys, but this is more drinking in one weekend than I've done in quite some time, so I'm definitely hearing the couch call my name. Plus, I know I have a bunch of work to get done tomorrow for my freelance client, so I can't afford to feel hungover again tomorrow. I close my tab and head to the train.  $16 Advertisement 9 p.m. \u2014 Home and starving because I haven't eaten since brunch this morning. I order pad thai and cozy up on the couch watching TV until B. gets home and we can catch up on our days.  $21 10 p.m. \u2014 Crap, I realized I forgot to cancel my HBO free week subscription, and my account was just charged. I activated it last week to watch  Get Out  (which was amazing!!!) and forgot to cancel. Oops! Doing that now.  $15 12 a.m. \u2014 B. is finally home after an extremely busy day at the restaurant, so he is wiped out. I've already lit a candle in our room and turned down our bed so it's ready to climb into. A friend told to me recently that she has been doing her own turn-down service at night as a self-care routine, and I am TOTALLY into it lately too. There is nothing better than walking into your candle-lit bedroom with a fluffy clean bed waiting for you. We both climb in and have a little much needed *fun* time before passing out. Ahhhh, weekends are the best!

I get up, wash my face, brush my teeth, and put on a pot of coffee before taking the dog outside. 9:45 a.m. \u2014 Once she's done her business, I take the dog back inside and then hop over to the grocery store across the street for some breakfast fixin's and other essentials for the week. I walk out with bananas, a bag of organic oranges, a red pepper, red skin potatoes, a dozen eggs, cottage cheese, blue corn chips, gluten-free bread, and garbage bags. B. and I have been really trying to eat organic as much as possible lately.  $36 Advertisement 10 a.m. \u2014 I put the groceries down and can't wait to get to work. I know I have a lot ahead of me and can't put it off for one more minute. I get started while sipping a cup of coffee and listening to jazz music \u2013 setting the mood is extremely important for my productivity when working from home. 11 a.m. \u2014 B. rolls out of bed to find me working and offers to make breakfast with the groceries I just bought. Bless this man. I am usually the breakfast cook and he is usually the dinner cook, so this is a treat. He is much more patient and intentional with his cooking than I am. I take a work break when the food is ready. 3 p.m. \u2014 Okay, this has been rough. The 3D model I'm working on keeps crashing my computer. I know I have a few more hours of work ahead of me at least, but I decide to take a break to walk the dog and go to the bodega to grab a few things. I get a pack of cigarettes, juice, and snacks. I know, I know, smoking is bad \u2014 I quit after college and haven't smoked for five years, but I recently picked it back up. It's my vice right now and I plan on quitting soon. I am very hard on myself in almost all areas of my life, so right now I've decided to cut myself some slack and let myself smoke here and there. I have quit before, so I know that I can quit again.  $15 Advertisement 6 p.m. \u2014 I send the renderings to my clients, and of course they write back with comments within minutes. This is just the nature of interior design and branding, so I get it and I expected it. We go back and forth sharing thoughts and updated renderings for the next couple of hours. 8 p.m. \u2014 Okay, I'm hangry. I haven't really eaten since breakfast, so I decide to use Caviar to order food. I text B. to see if he wants anything, and we decide to get Artichoke Pizza using a $10 coupon I have.  $20 9 p.m. \u2014 Pizza arrives. Holy SH*T. These slices are the size of my head, and we ordered four. I feed the dog dinner and then cut myself a half slice of each pizza flavor (one artichoke, one crab) to eat on the sofa while watching a little TV. My brain needs this break after working since I woke up. 10 p.m. \u2014 B. finally gets home after a long day just as I'm wrapping up my work. I send the project off to the client and type up my invoice so I don't forget. Days like this aren't exactly how I'd like to spend my self-care Sundays, but I'm certainly not complaining about the extra lump of cash I'll have in my pocket, or rather in our wedding fund, after this. 11:30 p.m. \u2014 My new routine (candle and cozy bed) is proving to be a winner. I am out in minutes. Advertisement Daily Total: $71", "day_five": "Day Five: 7 a.m. \u2014 Aaaaand it's back to work-work. It feels like I didn't get a huge break or relaxing weekend due to the freelance yesterday, so I'm not thrilled to be starting the next five-day slog. I get up and do my usual routine: coffee, makeup, hair, get dressed, throw coffee into a travel mug, walk the pup, kiss the fianc\u00e9, out the door. 9:05 a.m. \u2014 Getting VERY close to actually getting to work on time! But not quite. I sit down and get started on my list of items for the day after reading emails. Our clients on the project I'm working on are based in Hong Kong, so it's always a real treat to get to work in the morning and see what has come in overnight. (They're 12 hours ahead of us, so by the time we get to work, their day is over.) 12:45 p.m. \u2014 I head out to go grab my MealPal lunch (another acai bowl), and bring it back to the office. We have a presentation tomorrow, so I don't have time to take my full lunch hour. I absolutely detest when this happens \u2013 I think we need work-life balance and to take time to enjoy our lunch hours, but today it just ain't happenin'. 4 p.m. \u2014 Bored with my work and doing my usual internet procrastination, I come across a book I've heard about and have wanted to read for awhile:  Radical Acceptance . I'm on this constant journey to beat my anxiety and self-criticism that I suppose comes with being in your late 20s (Am I an adult? Am I old? Am I cool or am I boring?!), so I think this book will be a great one for helping me put things in perspective. I grab a used copy on Amazon Prime.  $10 Advertisement 6:30 p.m. \u2014 We finally wrap everything up for the presentation tomorrow and get the room ready with all of our printed presentation sheets as well as material samples. I head out and am so excited to go to the gym before heading back to Brooklyn. 7:45 p.m. \u2014 Done with my run and rush out the door to go grab a MealPal dinner. I have a few left this week to use up before my month plan is over. I get another tofu rice bowl at Num Pang to bring home and share with B. 9 p.m. \u2014 I finally get home after way too many train issues for a Monday night.

I brush off the negative energy as the meeting approaches and decide to just *not care*. Our clients finally arrive about a half hour late and we get into our long agenda. Advertisement 1:30 p.m. \u2014 Meeting is FINALLY over and I am starving. I missed my MealPal lunch window, so I go to a deli nearby to get a make-your-own salad with mixed greens, grapes, grilled chicken, walnuts, avocado, and corn. During my meeting, I got a call that the client on that freelance project I did over the weekend wants to see more options. I'm not complaining, because this means more extra income! It looks like I'll need to dedicate a few evenings this week and the weekend to work on it.  $12 6:30 p.m. \u2014 I wrap up my work for the day and head out of the office. 7:45 p.m. \u2014 I get home and B. is at the grocery store buying ingredients for dinner \u2013 yay! When he gets home, he starts cooking while I catch up on personal emails and respond to florists about our wedding flowers. 8:45 p.m. \u2014 We eat pan-seared tuna and roasted vegetables while watching a few episodes of Anthony Bourdain's Netflix show,  Parts Unknown .

I stop at Pret on my way into the office and grab a coffee since I forgot mine at home (sitting on the table steaming and ready for me to throw a lid on it \u2013 UGH), and a salad for lunch because I have a dentist appointment at lunchtime and won't have time to grab food.  $12 Advertisement 11:30 a.m. \u2014 We have a meet-and-greet meeting with a stone flooring vendor. It's always interesting to hear more about building materials and how they're used. It makes me feel smarter and that much better at my job! 1:30 p.m. \u2014 I eat lunch quickly at my desk before leaving for my dentist appointment. This appointment is supposed to be the last in a crown-replacement saga I've been dealing with, but I get there and find that the crowns don't match perfectly, so we decide I need to go to the lab (out in Long Island \u2013 UGH) to get fitted. I leave crying and call B. out of frustration. At least I don't have to pay the $900 out of pocket today that I was expecting to. I don't have dental insurance, so this whole debacle is coming out of my savings. (Thank you, freelance work!) 6:30 p.m. \u2014 I go to leave the office but remember I want to send our save-the-dates tomorrow, so I take a little time to address the last few while I'm still sitting at my desk. So excited to pop these babies in the mail and let the excitement officially begin! 7:45 p.m. \u2014 I get off the train and order shawarma and rice for dinner on my walk home from our fave place.

The baba ghanoush at this place is INSANELY good.  $20 8 p.m. \u2014 I walk in the front door and am so delighted by my pup \u2013 her reaction when one of us gets home is so priceless and sweet.

Then I quickly clean up and get back into my work with the show on in the background. 10:30 p.m. \u2014 B. gets home just as I'm starting to wrap up my freelance stuff. We tell each other about our days, chill on the couch with the pup, and watch a couple episodes of  Sex and the City.  (He protests, but I know he secretly doesn't hate it \u2013 who would?

My boyfriend, M., usually leaves for work around the same time as me, but he has early mornings on Tuesdays and is out the door before I even open my eyes. I find it easier to get ready when I have the apartment to myself, so I take the opportunity to doze later than I usually do. 8 a.m. \u2014 Okay, I dozed a bit longer than I meant to. I quickly throw on clean clothes, chug a glass of water with lemon, make a Nespresso, and head out the door to work. 9:15 a.m. \u2014 I make it to the metro station and realize my Opus card has demagnetized and wiped my monthly pass. This is a bit unfortunate, because it's only mid-month and a monthly pass costs $85. I decide to deal with it later, and buy a one-way pass just to get myself to work. It's kind of a long commute to my office, but I always have a book with me, so I don't mind. Right now I'm reading  A Cook's Tour  by Anthony Bourdain.  $3 Advertisement 10 a.m. \u2014 Arrive at the office and immediately make another coffee.

While I'm based in Montreal, the main office is in New York, and I find myself traveling back and forth a lot to coordinate with the team there. I decide to apply for a Nexus trusted traveler card to make airport security less of a headache. To complete the application, I have to write down the addresses of every apartment I've lived in over the last five years, which makes me realize I've moved a lot!  $50 1 p.m. \u2014 A few of my coworkers are going to grab lunch at an izakaya next to our office. I tag along and order gyozas, a bowl of ramen, and a small Sapporo. I have psoriasis, so I usually try to avoid gluten (which irritates it), but I can't say no to noodles and a cold draft on a rainy afternoon.  $30 4 p.m. \u2014 Even though I've had office jobs my entire professional life, I still find it hard to remain focused while sitting at a desk all day. Sometimes I get up and go for a quick walk around the office, but today I opt for a walk to the caf\u00e9 around the corner for a soy latte and a vegan peanut butter brownie.  $8 Advertisement 6:15 p.m. \u2014 Home time! I head to the metro and hope my Opus card will magically work this time, but no such luck. I buy another one-way pass and head home. I'll deal with my Opus card on the weekend.  $3 7 p.m. \u2014 Ah, I love walking through the door after a long day at work. As an introvert, there's nothing better than having a few hours completely alone to recharge. I pour myself a glass of wine, dig the vegan brownie out of my backpack, and put on last night's episode of  Big Brother Canada . (Don't @ me! A little mindless TV helps me unwind.) 8 p.m. \u2014 I check my emails and get a little freelance work in before M. comes home. Although I'm a full-time magazine editor, I still enjoy freelance writing on the side. My current freelance beat is food and restaurant reviews, and I love it. I live in one of the food capitals of Canada and will take any excuse to dine out more frequently! 9:15 p.m. \u2014 M. gets home from work and we prepare dinner together. He works in finance and always gets home pretty late. We prepare a kale salad with smoked tofu, various vegetables, flax seeds, and a dijon apple cider vinegar dressing. 10 p.m. \u2014 I make a cup of slippery elm tea (it's supposed to help with psoriasis) and we lazily sink into the couch while watching  This Hour Has 22 Minutes  \u2013 which is basically Canada's answer to  SNL .

Then I make myself a Nespresso and get back to work on my brainstorm. Some of the editors at work let me know that they're also working from home. I'm still adjusting to being a manager and sometimes forget that people have to report to me! 12:30 p.m. \u2014 I'm getting hungry and decide to order a pizza and take my lunch a bit early.

Since we're already in the kitchen, I decide to make energy balls to get me through the rest of the week and my upcoming flight to New York. 8:30 p.m. \u2014 After lazily cooking for nearly three hours, we sit down to honeyed carrots, marinated mushrooms, a heaping kale salad, and sliced celeriac and radishes with vegan caviar and sour cream. It's quite the feast! I'm very lucky that M. loves cooking. We've been together for six years and his culinary skills have only gotten better. 9:45 p.m. \u2014 We move to the couch to watch an old  CSI  rerun before I head off to bed.

I make myself a Keurig coffee and tidy up the spare desk that we keep for visitors. 12 p.m. \u2014 My colleague arrives and we head out for a team lunch at a cool brasserie down the street. We split a bottle of wine ($70) and order a bunch of different bites to share ($85). I'm usually the one to expense team lunches, but since my boss is in town, she takes care of it.

Whoops. 6:30 p.m. \u2014 I'm greeted by both of my cats as I walk through the door. I give them each a quick scratch and immediately search for a snack. I remember the energy balls I made last night and grab a couple to munch on while I do a clay mask and text with my mom. After lounging around a bit, I decide to pull out my yoga mat and do a pilates Youtube video. I've been trying so hard to maintain a steady workout routine lately, but I'm finding it really difficult to stick with. I go out of town a lot, and that always breaks my habit. I'm considering traveling with a yoga mat to encourage working out while away from home.

I'm not very hungry after the huge lunch we had at work, so I pour myself a celery juice and prepare a salad for M. 10:05 p.m. \u2014 M. comes home late tonight. Bummer. I chat with him while he eats his salad. Turns out he had a bad day at work, so we each have a Scotch to unwind and talk about our weekend plans before heading to bed. Daily Total: $75.11", "day_four": "Day Four: 7 a.m. \u2014 I decide to make up for yesterday's late start and jump out of bed without hitting snooze once. I get 20 minutes of at-home pilates in before knocking back a lemon water and celery juice and watching CNN. American news scares me a little bit right now, but I think it's responsible to be informed. I make a Nespresso, check my emails, flick through Instagram, and make a salad and a smoothie to bring to work before I start getting ready. 9:15 a.m. \u2014 M. drops me off at the metro and I make my way to work from there. We absolutely love our neighborhood, but it's about a 20-minute walk to the nearest metro station. Lovely in the summertime, but not so great during the snowy-slash-rainy springtime. I try to swipe my faulty Opus card and it magically works again, which is a relief! Advertisement 9:55 a.m. \u2014 My office does free bagel breakfasts on Fridays, but I feel like I've consumed too much gluten this week (and it's irritating my psoriasis), so I stop at the gluten-free bakery across the street and pick up bagels there so I don't feel left out. They don't compare to real Montreal bagels, but they'll do. I keep a bottle of Trader Joe's Everything But The Bagel seasoning at my desk for days like these, which I sprinkle onto the bagel in an attempt to trick my palate into thinking I'm eating the real deal. It kind of works.  $5.45 10 a.m. \u2014 One of my colleagues arrives with his dog! Day = made. My office does \"dog days,\" where editors can bring their dogs to the office for a visit. It's probably my favorite job perk. 12:30 p.m. \u2014 I ordered a vintage Louis Vuitton Mini Speedy bag on eBay last week, and it arrives at the office just in time for the weekend! It shipped from Japan, so I had budgeted for a hefty duty fee, but, pleasant surprise: they don't charge me anything! I've been collecting vintage Louis Vuitton since I was 17. I sometimes justify my purchases by checking the resale value on the particular bag I'm interested in. Even after using a Louis for a few years, I can almost always sell it for more than I paid for it. 1:30 p.m. \u2014 I take a quick break from work to put together my salad and bring it back to my desk so I can continue working. I usually make really elaborate salads for lunch and dinner but it's Friday, and our supplies from the weekend are running low. It's mainly semi-wilted kale, cucumber, radish, and flax seeds. I refuse to call it a sad desk lunch, even though it kinda is. Advertisement 2:45 p.m. \u2014 I take another quick break from working to get up and stretch my legs, make a Keurig coffee, and have another half of a gluten-free bagel. The day is flying by and I still have so much to do before I leave for the weekend! 5 p.m. \u2014 I finished up most of my work and head out for the day. I usually try to leave the office by 4 on Fridays to make it to my freelance social media consulting gig at 5, but sometimes it doesn't work out. I jump in an Uber and let them know I'm going to be a bit late.  $18.96 5:30 p.m. \u2014 I arrive at the office and grab a spare desk. I've been helping a pretty big local business get their social media strategy off the ground. I work from 5 to 9 on Fridays and a few hours from home throughout the week. The pay is stellar and the managers have wine and cheese nights most Friday evenings \u2013 win! 9 p.m. \u2014 I text my friends to see if they're ready to meet up. We're having dinner at one of my all-time favorite restaurants tonight so they can prep me for dogsitting. They have the sweetest shiba inu in the world, and I always take care of her when they go on vacation. M. and I drive to the restaurant and find parking almost immediately. It's free after 9, so we don't have to pay. 9:30 p.m. \u2014 The restaurant doesn't take reservations and is notoriously permanently busy, but one of our angelic friends showed up early and requested a table in advance, so we're seated right away once we arrive in a comfy corner booth. We catch up and order a ton of plates to share and a bottle of wine. This restaurant is one of the best in Canada (literally \u2013 I think it ranks fourth) and has an excellent wine selection, so we ask the waiter to surprise us with a bottle. Advertisement 12 a.m. \u2014 M. pays for our share of the dinner ($150 for both of us), and then we say goodbye to everyone and head home. We fall asleep almost immediately.

We decide to take M.'s convertible out for a spin to enjoy the sunshine. 9 a.m. \u2014 First stop: coffee. We stop at one of our favorite coffee shops for almond milk lattes and a chocolate chip cookie to share. My treat.  $12 9:30 a.m. \u2014 We continue onto a plant warehouse we've been meaning to go to. It's about an hour outside of the city but apparently they have the best cactus selection in the surrounding area and we've been wanting to find a cactus for our bedroom. It ends up being a gorgeous drive and we score two cacti \u2013 one for us and one for M.'s sister who's having a birthday party tonight.  $45 1 p.m. \u2014 As we're driving back to the city, we remember that some friends recently bought a house in the town we're driving through. We text them and end up meeting up and enjoying the sun, wine, and a nice catch up session in their sprawling backyard (#goals), before heading back to Montreal. 5 p.m. \u2014 Back in Montreal. A new bookstore opened up down the street from our apartment so we pop in for their opening. We end up having a few glasses of complimentary wine and I pick up a Zadie Smith book for M.'s sister's birthday and  A Wrinkle in Time  for me.  $31 Advertisement 7:30 p.m. \u2014 We head back to our apartment, get ready for M.'s sister's birthday, and head over to her house. It's a \u201cmargarita party,\u201d which just literally means everyone is drinking and mixing margs. I'm usually a wine girl, but it turns out to be a fun change of pace. We also eat a ton of guac and chips. M.'s sister is a vegetarian like me, so there's always great snacks at her parties. 12 a.m. \u2014 After a fun evening of drinking and dancing, we head home, first stopping to pick up late night veggie dogs at a local 24-hour greasy spoon.  $5.80 2 a.m. \u2014 We get into bed and fall asleep watching a random comedy show on Netflix.

We rush around each other to get ready and then head out the door. It's another absolutely gorgeous day, so we take advantage of it by putting the top down on the convertible. 9 a.m. \u2014 The tour ends up being way cooler than we expected. We sign up for their weekly subscription service (no charge to sign up) and score free greens and bananas from the farm! 12 p.m. \u2014 M. and I drop the car at home and head out for a day of exploring our neighborhood. It's still sunny and warm, so we want to take advantage of it! First stop: a delicious little taco joint. We each get two tacos, churros, and coffee (my treat), and then continue on walking.  $17 Advertisement 1 p.m. \u2014 We make it to our favorite farmer's market and pick up groceries for the week ($27). We get extra beers ($6), iced coffee ($5.50), and macarons ($6), and then walk over to the Lachine Canal for an impromptu picnic in the sun. (We split the cost of everything.)  $22.25 3 p.m. \u2014 I have early drink plans with a friend in a few hours, so we decide to walk back to the apartment so that I can get ready to go. It's about a half hour walk, but we don't mind \u2013 the weather has put us both in such a great mood! I silently wonder why we choose to live in a country that's below zero for half the year. 5:30 p.m. \u2014 I meet up with my friend, A., at the wine bar around the corner from my apartment. She used to be my boss at my current job, which is hilarious to think about because we have become very close friends since then. We order a bottle of wine ($70) and appetizers ($20) and catch up. We both travel often for work and for pleasure, so we always have new stories to share. (We split the cost.)  $45 7:30 p.m. \u2014 A. takes an Uber to meet her mom for dinner and I walk home. I still have to pack for my work trip to New York tomorrow and get to bed. I'm leaving for the airport at a seriously unholy hour. 9 p.m. \u2014 I'm finally all packed and in bed with my book.

(This is why I need a Nexus pass!!!) At this point I'm starving, so I pick up an iced Americano from Starbucks, a Clif Bar, and a Smartwater. My skin becomes super sensitive and dry when I fly (thanks, psoriasis), so I try to stay as hydrated as possible.  $14 6:15 a.m. \u2014 I'm exhausted from my early start, so I take the opportunity to snooze during the flight. 9:30 a.m. \u2014 Made it to JFK! I pick up a juice ($6) before getting into the Uber to the city ($65). I don't know what it is about NYC, but every time I visit I end up eating way too much pizza, so I try to counterbalance it with greens as much as I can.

It may be my favorite thing about visiting. Advertisement 12 p.m. \u2014 I was supposed to have lunch with my colleagues, but I'm interviewing a potential new editor in an hour and don't want to be late to meet with them. I decide to run to Whole Foods and pick up a quick salad. I remember one of my colleagues' birthday is tomorrow, so I also pick up a cute little birthday cake for him. ($16.75 expensed) 1 p.m. \u2014 I meet with the first candidate for the job. The interview goes well and we find out we're heading to the same press event later this week! I guess New York is smaller than I thought! 5 p.m. \u2014 I head out a bit earlier than I would if I was working from Montreal. I was up at 4 this morning and want to try and take a quick nap and shower before the event I have tonight. 5:30 p.m. \u2014 Back at my hotel, I contemplate going out to try and find pizza, but I order ramen from Seamless instead and slurp it quickly while getting ready. One of my old friends from Canada is hosting a Scotch-tasting press event tonight and invited me to check it out. I'm bringing another Canadian expat who I haven't seen in a few years. Although I'm exhausted, it should be a fun night! ($23 expensed) 7 p.m. \u2014 I decide to walk to the event from my hotel rather than take the subway to see some NYC sights. I don't know if I could ever live here (I am a Montrealaise through and through), but I always love taking in everything the city has to offer while I'm here. 7:30 p.m. \u2014 I meet up with my friends, S. and K., and head into the event. It's already full of editors and influencers, but there are plenty of Scotch cocktails to go around. 9:30 p.m. \u2014 After a super informative Scotch tasting, S. and I say goodbye to K. and head out to find pizza. We're a little tipsy after all the Scotch and still have plenty to talk about, so we grab two slices each (my treat) and find a stoop to continue our catch up.  $12 10:30 p.m. \u2014 I hate to call it a night, but I have work tomorrow.

My friend tells me everything is fine and that she took the kids to the park for a picnic. Then I join my colleagues to eat. They all want to have a hot meal at the cafeteria. I eat the food I brought from home and buy an Orangina.  $2 Advertisement 7 p.m. \u2014 My shift ends and I can't wait to come home. I phone my husband, who picked up my daughter and then took her to a Funko Pop shop rather than sorting out dinner \u2013 sigh. I come home and roast veggies and lamb while my husband and daughter endlessly chat about those Funko figurines. It's really their thing and I just don't get it. After dinner, I tuck my daughter in and pass out almost instantly while watching  Brooklyn Nine-Nine  on Netflix.

It evens out, because next week I'm doing four shifts for a total of 48 hours. I get to the hospital on time and spend the entire morning rushing from one patient to another. I hate it when we're understaffed; I feel like I'm not doing my job properly by not spending enough time with each child and his or her family. I get lasagna, a side salad, Perrier, and coffee at the cafeteria for lunch.  $10 7 p.m. \u2014 I leave the hospital almost an hour after my shift is over. There was just so much to do today and not enough of us to do it. My patients are on my mind. I make a stop to pick up a delivery package. It's clothes for my daughter that I ordered a while ago. Then I stop at a Vietnamese takeaway place and get dumplings and spring rolls to eat with whatever veggies and cheeses I have at home leftover from my market splurge.  $15 Advertisement 9:30 p.m. \u2014 My daughter is in bed, and my husband and I watch old  How I Met Your Mother  episodes and more  Brooklyn Nine-Nine.  While we're watching TV, I do some online linen shopping. We've needed good linen for a while and there's a sale, so I order four duvet covers for our bed and my daughter's, fitted sheets, pillow cases, tea towels, bath towels, a bath rug, and two small cushions to brighten up the living room.

I tell her that as soon as she gets out of school, we're leaving for our weekend trip to Paris. We're attending a wedding on Saturday and hitting Disneyland on Sunday. She barely responds. I make her a bowl of cereal and I have coffee and a yogurt. Once I drop her off, I swing by the pharmacy to get shower gel, shampoo, conditioner, moisturizer, micellar water, toothbrushes, and a sheet mask.  $90 9:30 a.m. \u2014 I stop by the hospital to say hello and see how our patients are doing. I have a little chat with other nurses over a cup of coffee, courtesy of our nurse manager, about the state of our ward. Depressing. I leave wondering what it's going to be like on Monday. 11 a.m. \u2014 I come home only to find that my monthly My Little Box has arrived, which is always a little bit thrilling. Also clothing I ordered arrived. I unbox my two packages. The clothing one is great: good cut, quality fabrics, fits well, so I'm very happy with that. My Little Box is quite disappointing, though: lots of sample sizes and not-so-great goodies. Oh well, I guess that's the risk you take with a monthly box subscription. After that, I make myself an asparagus frittata and a side salad before cleaning the house and packing. I hang up our wedding clothes in the back seat of the car and then realize I don't have any shade of lipstick that goes with my dress, so I dash to the store to get one.  $30 Advertisement 4:30 p.m. \u2014 We pick up my daughter from school with the car fully loaded and ready to go. We have a six and half hour journey ahead of us. My daughter says she's starving when she comes out of school, so we stop at a bakery and get a croissant and two water bottles. My husband prefers to drive at night when there are less cars, but driving in the dark makes me nervous. So I drive until nightfall, and then my husband takes over.  $4 8 p.m. \u2014 We stop at a McDonald's for dinner on the road, and order one happy meal, one quarter pounder with cheese, one chicken wrap, and two McFlurries ($35).

We have to be at the town hall at 1 p.m., so we order room service for breakfast. We have croissants, toasts, scrambled eggs, smoked salmon, cheese, and fruits to sustain us until the evening. We put it on the room tab, which my husband picks up. I make a mental note to find a supermarket to buy snacks to tide my daughter over with in the afternoon. We get ready for the ceremony. 1 p.m. \u2014 I find a supermarket and get breadsticks and Fruit Shoots to leave in the car for later. We get to the town hall, and then go to church for the religious ceremony, which is beautiful and very moving. It's my friend from nursing school who is getting married, and I can't help but think how much we've grown since then. We throw petals at the newlyweds and then there's a photoshoot session in the church garden where I pose with our other nursing school friends. We have a great laugh.  $6 Advertisement 10 p.m. \u2014 The party is in a beautiful house just outside Paris. The couple didn't want any presents, but the maid of honor and the best man set up a huge jar where people could leave money for the couple's honeymoon in Bali.

I get coffee for me and my husband to take with us in the lines ($8). We ride everything in Fantasyland.  $8 1:30 p.m. \u2014 We stop for lunch at Bella Notte, an Italian-style fast food place. I have pasta and a side salad with a Diet Coke, my daughter has a Mickey-shaped pizza, a popsicle, and juice, and my husband gets the lasagna with garlic bread, ice cream, and a Fanta. It's not great, but it gives us fuel to carry on with our day. My husband picks up the bill ($25 with 15% annual pass discount). 5 p.m. \u2014 We get my daughter a Rapunzel Animator doll ($22), and I grab cookies for the girls at work ($3.50), a Star Wars mug for my husband, and pens for me ($7). The children in the hospital always love to spot characters on my pens. My husband insists on paying again (20% off with our annual passes). We leave at 5:30 p.m., right after the parade. Then we stop by Earl of Sandwich and get a few sandwiches and crisps to share for the road. I pay this time ($30).

He's been feeling quite down for the last couple of months and has recently realized it's likely a relapse of his depression, which he hasn't suffered from for the past few years. We have a chat and a cuddle in bed before making lattes, scrambled eggs, and bacon for brekkie. He decides to take a mental health day off from work and makes a doctor's appointment for tomorrow. I do PhD work from home as per usual. Boyfriend takes our dog for a nice long walk while I write. 11 a.m. \u2014 I come across super cheap flights to Auckland (where my boyfriend's family lives), and we decide to book a short four-night trip. Boyfriend pays for the flights ($471.07 for the two of us), and I use my credit card travel points to book us a luxurious first night in a five-star hotel ($304.73). We're thinking of renting an Airbnb on beautiful Waiheke Island for the remaining three nights and inviting his family to come and stay there with us. Boyfriend got a new credit card last week and is trying to get to his sign-on amount ASAP to get his bonus points, so he is paying for more things than usual at the moment. (We're aiming to have enough points between us to take a round-the-world trip in business class in the next two years.)

(It's delicious, though.) Boyfriend pays the $23. 4 p.m. \u2014 My desk at home is a bit high, and when I have my chair at the correct height, my feet don't touch the floor (short girl problems). I decide enough is enough and order an adjustable foot rest from Officeworks ($34.22). I need to spend a little bit more to get free next-day delivery, so I add in a mousepad for my boyfriend.  $54.76 7 p.m. \u2014 My mum gets home from work, and we make dinner together. It's one of the last days of warm weather (we are truly entering autumn now!), so we have BBQ sausages, green salad, and potato salad. We share the cooking and cleaning in our house. My partner and I are responsible for the menu planning and writing the shopping list, and my mum does the bulk of the grocery shopping, with us picking up any extra little things that we require throughout the week. Our main groceries are included in the rent that we pay to my mum each week.

I make breakfast while my boyfriend starts work (remotely from home). He's usually on breakfast duty, but today I make our coffees and yogurt with granola and raspberries. I'm working from home again today, so I hit the computer after breakfast. 1 p.m. \u2014 My sister bought me a voucher for a facial from a place nearby, and my appointment is this afternoon. Traffic (as usual) is a nightmare in Melbourne, and it takes me nearly 40 minutes by the time I drive there, find a parking spot, and walk to the salon. It's gorgeous, and I have an amazing hour-long facial. After the treatment, I buy a new cleanser which is supposed to be a bit gentler than what I'm currently using and a facial oil which is supposed to replace moisturizer.  $108 3 p.m. \u2014 Boyfriend went to the doctor while I had my facial, so he tells me about it when I get home. It seems like a weight has been lifted from his shoulders, so I'm feeling relieved that he's on the path to getting better. We eat leftover BBQ for lunch, and I have a quick play with the dog before getting back to my work. 7 p.m. \u2014 Boyfriend is working until 6:30 tonight, so my mum and I make a Mexican-inspired BBQ corn and chorizo salad for dinner. It's delicious, and one of our favorites. Usually we make enough to have leftovers for lunch the next day, but decide not to tonight, as we will be out all day tomorrow, and I can't stand food wastage.

We're looking forward to catching up with these friends, as many of our friends are either married with children or single AF, so it's nice to spend time with another couple for a change. We're picking them up (I get really carsick as a passenger, so have volunteered to be designated driver for the day) in a couple of hours, so I make scrambled eggs and flat whites at home to fill us up before we leave. 11 a.m. \u2014 We make our first stop at Chandon for sparkling wines. We each do a tasting ($4.54 per person) of five wines, and we find a few winners. Our friends pay. As usual, my boyfriend loves the sparkling shiraz, and I like the sparking ros\u00e9. We buy a bottle of each, and my boyfriend pays. From there, we head to a gin distillery called Four Pillars Gin, which I've been wanting to visit for a long time. Upon entering, we're told that the tasting is two and a half standard drinks each, so I sit out for this one, since I'm driving. I still have a couple tiny sips of a few that I haven't tried before: Spiced Negroni gin, Modern Australian gin, Chardonnay barrel gin, and Sherry cask gin...YUM. 1 p.m. \u2014 We're feeling a bit hungry (and the others are getting a little tipsy), so we decide to head to lunch at Innocent Bystander. It's super busy today, and it seems like all of Melbourne had the same idea, so we have to wait a couple of hours for a table. We do a complimentary tasting of their range while we wait. Eventually, our table is ready and we order truffle and pecorino fries, broccoli salad, and three pizzas to share. The others each get a glass of wine but I get a lemon mineral water. We split the bill with our friends, and I pay for my boyfriend and myself.  $51.50 Advertisement 3 p.m. \u2014 After lunch we head to another vineyard (Yering Station) and try more wines. Our friends are going through a Chardonnay phase, so they try those while my boyfriend focuses on reds and I try a bit of a range. We buy a bottle of red and a dessert wine (so delicious) to take home (boyfriend pays), and our friends find a Chardonnay that they like. We head to Yarra Valley Dairy to sit down and have a cheese platter, but unfortunately there are no tables left, so instead we do a complimentary tasting, and I buy two different types of marinated goat's feta (one in saffron, garlic, and herbs, and one in chili oil) and a cow's cheese spread with dill to put on bagels for breakfast. They also have a really cute reusable bag, so I buy one to put the cheese in for the trip home.  $30.30 6 p.m. \u2014 Finally get home after dropping our friends off! My mum and I make a big batch of veggie-heavy fried rice with bacon and egg, and I make extra to take to my friend's place when I visit her tomorrow. She had twins a few months ago and also has a two-year-old, so I try to always come with some meals for them, as she definitely has her hands full!

I stop by my house to pick up my dog so she can come for a walk with us (two birds, one stone). I pay for parking next to the park, and we go for a nice walk in the sun. My surgical work is incredibly light this week because of the public holiday.  $1.01 12 p.m. \u2014 Text the boyfriend to see if he's free for lunch, as the park is a block away from his work.

Boyfriend pays. 3 p.m. \u2014 Head over to visit my friend and her babies, bringing the fried rice and a birthday present for her two-year-old (a soft toy unicorn from Cuddle + Kind bought a few weeks ago). It's nice to see her, and we hang out and have a cup of tea for an hour or so while I get lots of baby cuddles. They are super cute, and her two-year-old loves her toy. My friend mentions that she has been feeling a bit left out of friend excursions lately, and I ask her to come with me to the ballet in six weeks, since I have an extra ticket.

I'm trying to get myself to a place of work-life balance, and scheduling post-work classes has been a great way of making sure I leave work at a decent time. Dance has been fantastic, but I'm really intimidated by how good everyone in the class is. 8:30 p.m. \u2014 Time for evening calls!

Her flight gets in at 9:45, so I plan to leave at 9:30. I'm already exhausted because I went to a housewarming party last night, and then stayed up until 3 a.m. making nine batches of pie crust, followed by a batch of blueberry hand pies (which I froze before baking). Why this madness? I'm throwing a party at my apartment this coming Saturday and I'm planning on making 11 varieties of pies from scratch. I did this last year for my housewarming party and it was huge hit. 9:30 a.m. \u2014 While I'm eating one of my go-to breakfasts, a frozen El Monterey mini chicken burrito, my mom calls me to tell me that she's already off the plane. I'm not in my car yet. Oops. Luckily there is very little traffic on Sunday mornings, so I'm able to get there in less than 30 minutes. 10 a.m. \u2014 My mom and I drive to the funeral home for the wake. I don't really feel like going because I have stuff to do, I've never met this great-uncle, and I'm nowhere near appropriately dressed for the occasion (jeans, hoodie, sneakers, and North Face fleece jacket). However, my mom convinces me in a way that only Vietnamese mothers can, so I give in and go with the family. Advertisement 11 a.m. \u2014 It's mostly my mom's extended family members at the wake, who I'm not very familiar with. I'm horribly underdressed, but at least my North Face jacket is black. Mostly I just feel awkward, especially when we do the white headband tying ceremony. In Vietnamese culture, all relatives down to grandchildren wear white headbands to the deceased's funeral, while great-grandchildren wear yellow and great-great grandchildren wear red. There's a reception afterwards with a fantastic spread of Vietnamese goodies \u2014 P\u00e2t\u00e9 chaud (meat pies in puff pastry), banh mi sandwiches, sweet sesame balls, and banh gio (meat rice dumplings wrapped in banana leaf). There's a lot leftover, so I grab a few banh mis and banh gio for later. 1 p.m. \u2014 We're back at my cousin's house. I hang out and chat with my relatives for another hour before saying goodbye to my mother. My cousin sends me home with bun rieu (crab and tomato noodle soup) that she made this morning. 2 p.m. \u2014 Because gas is cheaper in San Jose, I decide to fill up my tank at a nearby Shell station.  $38 2:30 p.m. \u2014 I'm planning to make P\u00e2t\u00e9 chaud for my pie party, which requires chopped up wood ear mushroom, so I stop by a 99 Ranch supermarket in Cupertino. I grab a small package of dried wood ear and an imported Nissin Cup Noodle in crab flavor. (I have a weakness for instant ramen.)  $3.18 3:15 p.m. \u2014 I'm finally home, so I start laundry and get started on pie-making. I make two batches of P\u00e2t\u00e9 chaud pies (with ground chicken) \u2014 24 pies total. I put the unbaked pies away in the freezer. Advertisement 5 p.m. \u2014 My boyfriend is coming over soon, so I quickly vacuum and straighten up my place. After he arrives, I start making dinner for us. In effort to clear out as much space in my freezer for all the pies I'll be freezing, I make a simple dinner of potsticker stir-fry \u2014 frozen Trader Joe's crab and sriracha dumplings and frozen Asian stir fry veggies. It's actually better than I anticipated, although I accidentally burn some of the dumplings. We eat it with Ito En jasmine tea, which I always have on hand at home. 8 p.m. \u2014 After dinner, I make spinach and artichoke hand pies and put them into the freezer. Then I watch an episodes of  SNL  hosted by Sterling K. Brown. I've recently started binge-watching  This is Us , which is not my usual type of TV show, but I'm really enjoying it. 11:30 p.m. \u2014 My boyfriend goes to sleep while I go into the living room and work on my LEGO Star Wars set for awhile. I'm a huge Star Wars and LEGO fan, and I own most of the LEGO Star Wars Ultimate Collector's Edition sets, which I have displayed in my living room. Afterwards, I get ready for bed. My nightly routine involves showering, flossing and brushing my teeth, removing my contact lenses, putting on eye and face cream, and then finally putting in my night guard. The night guard is annoying, but I need it because I grind my teeth in my sleep. Advertisement Daily Total: $41.18", "day_two": "Day Two: 9 a.m. \u2014 Today is a HUGE day for me. For nearly a decade, I've dreamt of becoming a gameplay engineer, but lack of knowledge and experience had prevented me from achieving that dream. But two weeks ago, after years of struggling (even getting fired at one point), I was told that my transfer from quality engineering to gameplay engineering was approved. Today is my first day at my DREAM JOB. I still can't believe it. However, I'm also really stressed out because I only got 10 days advance warning, and I feel like I am not at all prepared. Luckily, I'm staying on the same game (in a very popular game franchise), so I'm already familiar with some of the code base. Dreams really do come true! 9:30 a.m. \u2014 After my usual morning habit of checking my social media and emails on my phone, I finally get out of bed to brush my teeth, wash my face, and put in my contact lenses. Then I put on eye cream, face serum, sunscreen (Shiseido's Urban Environment Oil-Free UV Protector), and a few spritzes of the Fresh Sugar Lychee perfume (one of the few perfumes that I actually like). Next I flat-iron my hair and get dressed. My usual uniform is a hoodie, t-shirt, skinny jeans, and sneakers. 10 a.m. \u2014 After getting ready, I have a CalNaturale Svelte protein shake (cappuccino-flavored) for breakfast, and make myself an English muffin sandwich, which I pack up for lunch, along with two banh mi sandwiches from yesterday. I also pack up clothes and toiletries for tomorrow, as I'm staying at my boyfriend's tonight. Advertisement 10:30 a.m. \u2014 I arrive at work and start packing up my old desk to move over to my new one. I don't have to change floors and I don't have a lot of cubicle decorations (just a rolling filing cabinet filled with snacks), so it's relatively painless. 12 p.m. \u2014 I eat my English muffin sandwich and one of the banh mis, plus my usual mug of jasmine green tea. I typically eat my lunches at my desk while watching TV on my computer. 6:30 p.m. \u2014 After a day of moving cubicles, setting up gameplay tools, and munching on salt-and-pepper pistachios, my boyfriend (who also works on the same game as me, but in a different role and team) and I head to the on-site company gym. My right knee has been giving me trouble lately, so I've been doing mostly elliptical (followed by leg and foot exercises for my bad feet). I also use the gym as an opportunity to catch up on TV shows on my phone. At the moment, I'm finishing up the final season of the reboot of  Battlestar Galactica  on Hulu. 7:30 p.m. \u2014 We drive over to nearby Spanish tapas restaurant to celebrate my first day as a gameplay engineer and our two year anniversary. After toasting with glasses of cava, we have viera con espuma de salmon (smoked salmon and scallops toast), huevos escalfados (eggs baked in spinach, chickpeas, and cheese), carne a la parrilla (sirloin with potatoes), and flan. The flan is so good that all I want to do is lick the plate clean but I suppose we ARE in public. My boyfriend pays. Advertisement 9:30 p.m. \u2014 We drive over to my boyfriend's house for the night. From Sunday to Wednesday, we alternate places, and then from Thursday to Saturday, we stay at our own places, since that's when he has his son staying with him. We just chill and watch  Food Network  before going to bed.

I sell things on eBay as my side hustle. I've accumulated a lot of crap (mostly clothing, beauty products, and geek toys) over the years due to my shopaholic ways, and I've turned to eBay as a way of decluttering but also earning spending money for myself. I make about $500 every two months. 10:30 a.m. \u2014 Once I get to work, I have a protein shake and I start working on a new feature. 11:15 a.m. \u2014 I get another eBay sold notification, this time for a Hearthstone (the Blizzard card game) stress ball for $5. I always feel so oddly happy getting these \u201cYour Item Sold\u201d notifications, even if it's not for very much. 12 p.m. \u2014 Lunch is a banh mi sandwich and jasmine green tea at my desk. I'm still a bit peckish afterward, so I grab a mini Korean noodle salad from the cafeteria to supplement. I'll need it, seeing as today is a long day of meetings, followed by coding. I'm feeling frustrated because a lot of the stuff being discussed is going over my head and honestly, I'm really afraid of failing. I've already been fired once for underperformance before, and it would kill me if it happened again.  $1.63 Advertisement 4 p.m. \u2014 Midday snack of hummus crisps. I keep my \"snack\" cabinet under my desk, which I have filled with loads of snacks, instant noodles, and beverages. 6:30 p.m. \u2014 Off to the gym with my boyfriend again. After our workout, we head over to my place. I'm too tired to do anything elaborate for dinner, so I pull out a bag of Trader Joe's Linguine with Clam Sauce and throw in frozen cooked shrimp and kale. 9 p.m. \u2014 We cuddle up on my bed and watch a  Black Mirror  episode called \u201cShut Up and Dance.\u201d It's a really disturbing episode. Afterwards, my boyfriend goes to sleep, and I finish working on my LEGO project. It finally goes up in my display bookshelf and it is BEAUTIFUL. After admiring my handiwork, I get ready for bed. It's only Tuesday, but I'm already mentally worn out. Even so, I have a hard time falling asleep because I keep think about that damned  Black Mirror  episode.

I also print a shipping label and a packing slip for the eBay items I sold yesterday. 10:30 a.m. \u2014 Once I arrive to work, I drop off the eBay package at my floor's mail area, which gets picked up around noon daily. Having this means I never have to go to the post office, which saves me so much time. When I get to my desk, I have a protein shake for breakfast. Advertisement 12 p.m. \u2014 Desk lunch today. Luckily, I have a banh gio in the fridge, so I heat it up and hope that no one is offended by the smell. I'm still hungry afterwards, so I get one of my Nong Shim instant noodle bowls from my snack cabinet and eat that as well. 3 p.m. \u2014 The rest of the afternoon is meetings and more coding. I'm very slowly getting the hang of our toolset. I eat more hummus crisps for a snack. 6:30 p.m. \u2014 After work, I decide that it might be in my best interest to pick up cheap alcoholic beverages for my Pie Party, so I stop by Trader Joe's to buy some hard cider, those wonderful $4 four-pack canned ros\u00e9s, a raspberry lambic, and a carton of vegetable broth (for one of my pies).  $24.95 7 p.m. \u2014 Wednesday is Trivia Night for me, my boyfriend, and a bunch of our coworkers. I was a trivia nerd in high school, so naturally, my head is full of information that serves no purpose other than winning at trivia. It's at a nearby Irish bar that allows you to bring in food, so after I park my car, I walk over to Bonchon to get tteok-bokki (spicy rice cakes with fish cakes and cheese). Then I join my coworkers (including my boyfriend) at the bar.  $14.12 10 p.m. \u2014 We get seventh place in trivia. Typically there's at least a dozen teams competing at this bar, and some of them are really good. Each game is split up into six rounds, including a picture round, where they give you a handout with pictures of various celebrities, movies, and landmarks that you have to identify. All those years of reading celebrity gossip really pay off! Trivia Night has a two drink minimum, so I get myself a glass of pinot grigio and a Moscow Mule, and my boyfriend gets two Jack and Cokes. I pay for the both of us.  $33 Advertisement 10:30 p.m. \u2014 I drive out to my boyfriend's house to spend the night. I didn't finish the tteok-bokki, so I bring it with me. We're too tired to watch any TV, so we just cuddle and chat. Once my boyfriend goes to sleep, I browse the iOS App Store to check out some games. To my horror, I realize that a sequel to Monument Valley (a puzzle game that I really enjoy) has already been out since LAST JUNE. I quickly buy it and start playing.  $4.99 11:30 p.m. \u2014 Right before I fall asleep, I get yet another eBay sold notification on my phone.

We walk over to a sandwich shop, where I get a crab cake sandwich on Dutch crunch bread, a cup of Italian wedding soup, and a bottle of Ito En dark green tea. I absolutely love crab cakes and Italian wedding soups, so this lunch is especially delicious. My new manager pays for everyone's lunch. 1:30 p.m. \u2014 Back to work, where I spend the afternoon asking lots of questions and getting closer to finishing my first feature. I also snack away on Trader Joe's ranch chickpeas. 6:30 p.m. \u2014 I'm exhausted and have a lot to do, but I still drag myself to the gym. While walking back to my car afterwards, I get another eBay notification \u2014 I sold a Fresh gift set for $90! I'm so happy that it finally sold!

There're basically like hot pockets, but much tastier. I put them into the freezer. I also chop up most of the vegetables I'll need for Friday and Saturday \u2014 several cups of carrots, celery, and yellow onions. These all go into Tupperware in the fridge. 1 a.m. \u2014 I finally start getting ready for bed \u2014 shower, brush teeth, then relax. I peruse the J.Crew Factory and Nike websites to see if the items that I want are on sale.

After doing my normal routine, I print out labels for the last two eBay items and package them up. For breakfast, I have Lucky Charms with milk. 10:30 a.m. \u2014 Arrive to work. I send out a code review for my code change for my very first gameplay feature. It's standard practice for software engineers to send code reviews out to their peers/managers to look at to make sure they didn't miss anything and give suggestions on what they can do better. 12 p.m. \u2014 Normally on Fridays, I go out to lunch with my boyfriend, but he needs to head home early today, so I head over to the cafeteria and get a customizable Asian noodle soup bowl, which I eat at my desk while watching  Once Upon a Time .  $7.56 1 p.m. \u2014 I got some comments on my code suggesting some minor changes, so I spend time discussing/arguing them with people before finally making said changes and running more tests. I drink some green jasmine tea from the kitchen. 4:30 p.m. \u2014 Finally! All tests passed, so I submit my very first feature to our code repository. I hope to god that I didn't break anything (which would be especially embarrassing for my first week). It's really bad practice to leave work right after a submission (because if something breaks, then I need to be around to fix it), but I have no choice today. I leave early in order to hit the Safeway right by my apartment before the rush hour traffic gets bad, but also so that I can get home early to get going on my pie making. I quickly grab a russet potato and go through the self-checkout.  $1.46 Advertisement 5:15 p.m. \u2014 Once home, I hit the ground running with my pie-making. I start by making full size chocolate rum custard pie and chocolate bourbon pecan pie. The pecan pie is definitely one of my best pies, but mostly because I make it less sweet than typical pecan pie. 7:30 p.m. \u2014 I season chicken breast with salt, pepper, and olive oil and bake it in the oven for a half hour. While it's baking, I eat a Nong Shim spicy ramen bowl for dinner. At this point, I'm really too tired to make myself a proper dinner. I watch an episode of  This is Us  on Hulu while eating the ramen. 8:30 p.m. \u2014 I make the filling for my two batches of chicken pot pie using the chicken breasts that I just baked (although I have to shred them, which takes longer than it ought to) and the vegetables that I chopped last night. I make it with my secret ingredient: curry powder. Since it has to cool completely, the rest of the pie assembly will have to wait until tomorrow. Then I start on the shepherd's pie (using Alton Brown's recipe), followed by the filling for the mini Strawberry pies, and then a pitcher of sangria. I almost never use the same recipe each time I make sangria, so this one has merlot, brandy, triple sec, fruit juice, and an apple (for now). I put it into the fridge to let it sit overnight. 12:15 a.m. \u2014 I finally clean the kitchen, followed by a very thorough scrubbing of my shower/tub. My shower has clear glass doors, and they're a bit dingy at the moment. I don't want my guests judging me on the state of my bathroom tomorrow.

Getting up this early on a weekend is highly unusual for me, but there is so much to be done before the party starts at 3:14 (Pi time, obviously) today. After doing my normal bathroom routine, I make myself a cup of Starbucks instant coffee. While sipping my coffee, I decide to impulsively buy a digital copy of  The Disaster Artist  from Amazon Video so my friends and I can watch it while we eat pie.  $14.99 9:30 a.m. \u2014 I make and assemble curry root vegetable pies (eight individual tins) and mini strawberry pies (nine muffin tin-sized pies), and then add sliced citrus fruits to the pitcher of sangria. Apparently, you can't let citrus fruits sit in alcohol for too long, or the rind will impart a bitter flavor, which is why I didn't put them into the sangria last night. Then I start on the final pie: Fireball apple pie. I peel and slice up eight apples and put them into a large mixing bowl. Then I dump an ENTIRE bottle of Fireball whiskey over the apples and let them soak for four hours.

I start preheating the oven, and then hastily Swiffer my hardwood floors (using dry, then wet Swiffer pads). Yes, I like my floors very clean. 3:40 p.m. \u2014 The first guest has arrived (one of my coworkers), and I am not quite ready, so I excuse myself to get dressed (in my red-and-white gingham check skirt and Grumpy Cat t-shirt) and quickly put on makeup. I have pretty good skin, so all I usually put on is mascara, taupe eyeliner, tinted face primer (I use the one from Dr. Brandt), and light lip gloss. I really don't have time to deal with my hair, so I just plait it into pigtails and call it a day. 4 p.m. \u2014 The actual baking begins. The only pie I have ready is the chocolate pie that I baked last night. A steady stream of guests begins arriving. I maintain the flow of pies baking, both in my main oven and in my toaster oven. Unfortunately, because I have to pay attention to multiple timers for my ovens, I'm unable to do anything with the drinks. My previous grandiose plans of making to-order cocktails have failed to come to fruition. Advertisement 5 p.m. \u2014 I drain the sliced apples from the bowl of Fireball, and pour the apple-infused Fireball into a small pitcher. It's actually a huge hit, and even people who don't like Fireball (myself included) actually enjoy it. I make a mental note to make this apple pie more often so that I can bring this Fireball to parties. 6 p.m. \u2014 The party is in full swing. I have over 20 guests crammed my living/dining area and they are LOUD. They're playing Codenames (the word association game) and Scrawl (which is kinda like a dirty adult version of Telephone and Pictionary combined). I desperately want to join in on the Scrawl madness, but I gotta focus on the pies. I finally bake the Fireball apple pie (which has a large Pi symbol carved on top). Hot pies are coming out at a steady pace. I put on  The Room  and then  Spaceballs  on the TV in the background. 8 p.m. \u2014 Some of the guests have left, so I finally get around to eating. I have a P\u00e2t\u00e9 chaud, a spinach and artichoke hand pie, half of a cheeseburger pie, a blueberry hand pie, and a tiny slice of the chocolate rum pie. 10 p.m. \u2014 More people leave, so I finally get to sit down with a thin slice of the chocolate bourbon pecan pie and watch  The Disaster Artist  with the remaining guests. 11 p.m. \u2014 The last of my friends leave. My feet and legs are tired, my place is a mess, and I have tons of leftover pies. I quickly put away food in the fridge, throw away trash, and load up the dishwasher before retiring for the night. The dirty counters and pots/pans/trays can wait until tomorrow. Whew! This has been too much of a week, and I am so emotionally, physically, and mentally drained. After showering, I sleep for the next 12 hours. Daily Total: $14.99", "url": "https://www.refinery29.com/money-diary-san-francisco-bay-area-gameplay-engineer-salary"},

I can hear my fianc\u00e9 in the other room and wonder if he's going to come in and lay with me. I hate waking up early, and he wakes up with the sun, so sometimes he joins me in bed. He doesn't this morning, and I begrudgingly get out of bed and get ready. I got paid today, so I transfer my fianc\u00e9 $100 towards my portion of our monthly co-op payment while I have my morning tea. He walks me to the bus and then goes back home (since he works from home). 9:10 a.m. \u2014 I started drinking coffee again recently for the first time in years, and I love the French bistro at the corner of my office building. I get a small skim latte and a chocolate croissant because I figure I can spare it on payday.  $7.53 1 p.m. \u2014 My office has a cafeteria, where I get dumplings ($7.59) for lunch. While I eat I text my best friend (who is also my fianc\u00e9's cousin). She came over last night and we ordered takeout from our favorite Thai place, but I know she's having issues with her job, so I offer to pay her back for my half. She accepts and I transfer her $20.  $27.59 2:30 p.m. \u2014 I go online to pay our electric bill ($65.02) and my monthly tuition payment. I moodily pay and think about how a whole third of my check is gone already and I only just got paid today! I love and hate payday. I'm currently contracting and am getting paid way below my usual rate. I love the work, but I haven't gotten paid this little since I first started out in my field. It's frustrating sometimes to be living paycheck to paycheck. I have to budget out monthly expenses by the week, which is difficult for me because I'm used to getting paid larger amounts at once. Advertisement 4:15 p.m. \u2014 My coworker convinces me to go downstairs to Starbucks with her. I manage not to get a coffee (I'll be up until 2 a.m. if I do), but I do get chips and peanut butter cups.  $5.98 6 p.m. \u2014 On my way home I pick up three bottles of wine ($31.54) from our local liquor store and spend the rest of the evening hanging out with my fianc\u00e9 and his best friend. Our apartment is in the East Village and we both grew up here in NYC, so friends and family frequently stop by. His friend gives me a $25 Starbucks card he got that he says he's never going to use, so I upload it into my app. I go to bed around 11 and my fianc\u00e9 follows a few minutes later.  $31.54 Daily Total: $72.64", "day_two": "Day Two: 10 a.m. \u2014 I wake up and enjoy the fact that I don't have an alarm today! My fianc\u00e9 is playing videos game in the living room and I make a shake with leftover blood oranges, yogurt, honey, almond butter, and almond milk. It's not very good and I'm disappointed. My fianc\u00e9 and I lounge around and talk before I leave to get on with my day. We make plans to do errands later and I kiss him goodbye. 12:15 p.m. \u2014 I love, love, love my manicure place, which is a hair salon in the Meatpacking District, and even though it's a costly expense right now ($27 after tip), getting my nails done makes me feel good. I started coming here over four years ago and have become friendly with the staff. They're having a moving sale, and while my nails dry, I find a perfect necklace for my future sister-in-law's birthday gift. It's so perfect and 60% off, so I decide it's worth it ($18.97).  $45.97 Advertisement 3 p.m. \u2014 I need a dress for my cousin's wedding that's in a month. My future sister-in-law has a clothing line with a friend, and I decide to walk over to their store to see if they have anything I might like. I hang out and play dress up for a couple hours with her business partner, but decide to wait on getting a dress because the one I really like in my size is out on a photo shoot. I buy a logo t-shirt of their brand.  $27.22 6 p.m. \u2014 I get home and go food shopping with my fianc\u00e9. Since we live in such a central location, we have a choice of several supermarkets and we decide where to go based on what we want to buy. We decide on the middle-priced supermarket and get toilet paper, paper towels, eggs, hemp milk, frozen spinach, frozen mixed veggies, tofu, onions, and seltzer. I pay because my fianc\u00e9 and I have an agreement that I cover most of the food and he covers the bulk of rent.  $46.33 6:45 p.m. \u2014 I decide to try a pan chicken recipe from Pinterest that's chicken thighs, lemon, garlic, and rice started on the stovetop and finished in the oven. My food experiments are 90% successful, though I have a chronic habit of confusing chili powder and cayenne pepper (but luckily this one doesn't call for either!). It comes out really well and my fianc\u00e9 likes it too! 7:10 p.m. \u2014 My best friend comes over to hang out, and we all meet my fianc\u00e9's cousin a few blocks away at a dive bar.

When I finally get up, I have tea and chat with my fianc\u00e9. I have schoolwork to do (graduation can't come soon enough!) and I procrastinate actually starting by looking through my emails. I get a lot of fashion and business newsletters and find them relaxing to look through. I'm also obsessed with Pinterest and use it as a mood board for every part of my life. My fianc\u00e9 suggests we go around the corner to the neighborhood diner we like, and I jump at the chance to not have to figure out food! I order two eggs over medium, roasted breakfast potatoes, bacon, toast, and decaf coffee. My fianc\u00e9 pays and we bring home leftover bacon and toast. 11:30 a.m. \u2014 I'm traveling to the far reaches of Brooklyn today (Sheepshead Bay) for a bridal shower for my cousin-to-be. Last weekend my mom and I went shopping to get gifts from the registry, and now I'm lugging a wooden cutting board set on the subway. It ends up being a pretty quick commute even with the transfer to the bus, and I get there exactly on time. I meet the bride's extended family, and everyone is super nice. I'm extra excited for the wedding! 7 p.m. \u2014 I get home and am a little buzzed from the bridal shower, so I decide I need to make a quiche. I use some of the ingredients from yesterday's grocery buy (frozen spinach, eggs, onions), and pour in milk, add in saut\u00e9ed onions, and crumble the bacon from today's breakfast into the mix. I use a pie crust I have in the freezer and bake it all for an hour. Then I sit and have a glass of wine I probably don't need while my fianc\u00e9 and I discuss what's going on with his business (he freelances) until we go to bed.

I used to get monthly ones, but since I'm budgeting I buy a new card every Monday. It only takes me about 30 minutes to commute from my apartment to my office in midtown, and I get to my desk around 9:15. 9:20 a.m. \u2014 I buy breakfast at my office's cafeteria, an egg on an English muffin, and eat it at my desk. It's a little dry, but I eat it anyway and make a mental note to get hot sauce or something next time.  $1.95 11 a.m. \u2014 I brought some of yesterday's quiche for lunch, so I don't have to buy lunch today! I eat it before the bulk of my meetings. Mondays are busy for me, and I often have recaps to do after all my meetings. By 3:30, I'm totally wiped out and make myself a tea. I keep a couple boxes of tea and honey in my desk because I have a serious tea habit. 7 p.m. \u2014 My fianc\u00e9 went out with a friend and I rarely get an evening without him. His working from home means we spend a lot time together and even though I love it (and him!), I like my alone time. I order in Thai and get him pineapple fried rice to eat for lunch tomorrow and myself vegetable soup and fried spring rolls.

I make tea while I get ready and throw it in my to-go bottle before my fianc\u00e9 walks me to the bus. 11:30 a.m. \u2014 I amazingly have no meetings until the afternoon, so I eat lunch early because I forgot to get breakfast while working on some things. I get chicken and pork souvlaki with collard greens from the cafeteria. Then, I make a tea and nibble on chocolate lollipops I got from the bridal shower on Sunday.  $8.08 5:45 p.m. \u2014 I had shoes being fixed at the cobbler, so I pick them up and they look perfect! These are my favorite pair of designer shoes, and I wear them to work a lot, so I'm super happy to have them back. I had paid for half of the repair when I dropped them off, so now I pay the second half.  $17 6 p.m. \u2014 I grab a salad from the deli at the corner of my school. I get mixed greens, beets, chickpeas, olives, mozzarella, and a hardboiled egg with balsamic and olive oil. I also buy a hazelnut and chocolate dipped yogurt bar thing that sounds great. They give discounts to students, so I take advantage, but it only really saves me $1. Still, I'm going to miss using my student ID for discounts! I go into school and eat while I wait for class to start at 6:30.  $10.11 Advertisement 8:20 p.m. \u2014 Class gets out a little early. My fianc\u00e9 is out and I realize I've forgotten my keys! UGH. Luckily, his mom lives in the building, so I call her and we hang out while I wait for my fianc\u00e9 to come home. She offers me veggie soup she made (she's a great cook and recently became vegan), but I decline since I'm still full from my salad.

I get a sparkling water as well and eat at my desk. Some coworkers tell us there's free fruit and cheese in the kitchen on our floor, so I also get pineapple, melons, and strawberries as dessert. Perfect.  $8.28 3 p.m. \u2014 I have a meeting from 2:30 to 3:30. Our part is done pretty quickly, so we leave the meeting after 20 minutes. One of the cool things about this job is they don't like to waste people's time in meetings they don't have to be in, so if the part you needed to be there for is over, you don't have to stay. It's a great policy. I get to leave early today, which means cuddling at home with the fianc\u00e9!

I pay for my tab.  $12.65 9 p.m. \u2014 We hop over to the Museum of Contemporary Art Detroit. Tonight is the opening reception for an exhibition on Tom of Finland. It's amazing! It was my first time seeing his work in real life, and I was incredibly impressed. Considering the nature of Tom of Finland's work, it drew in a huge crowd, full of leather daddies wearing raunchy leather harnesses, leather chaps \u2014 you name it. We say hi to a few people, hang out and chat, and then we're off to the next place. 9:45 p.m. \u2014 We make a quick stop at the College for Creative Studies in Midtown. There's a wood firing happening tonight in the ceramics department, and my BF wants to see how it's going. We stop in and chat with students and his old professors. 10:30 p.m. \u2014 I drop our friend off at his house because his phone died and his girlfriend was probably wondering where he was. Then, my BF and I head back across town to Hamtramck for karaoke. Fun fact: Detroiters love their karaoke. We've got karaoke seven nights a week here. I go at least once every week, but sometimes we'll go two or three times because it's so frickin' fun! Everyone's just hanging out, drinking, cheering, and singing their favorite songs. I'm a terrible singer, but I still love doing it. My boyfriend, on the other hand, has the voice of an angel. His go-tos are usually Usher, JT, Beyonce (on a good night), and Luther Vandross. Tonight I sing \"Short Skirt, Long Jacket\" by Cake. I drink a Hot Toddy because my throat feels dry.  $5 Advertisement 11:30 a.m. \u2014 We get back to my boyfriend's house. I take a quick shower because I know my morning zombie self won't, and we go to sleep.

I mumble gibberish and fall back asleep for a few. 8 a.m. \u2014 Get back to my apartment and do my skincare routine, put on my makeup, change, and pack my lunch and breakfast. I eat a piece of peanut butter toast because I'm really hungry, but I'm secretly hoping someone brings bagels into the office. 9 a.m. \u2014 Nobody brings bagels. I sneak off and proceed to cry in the bathroom stall. JK, JK. I make myself quinoa oatmeal and two cups of coffee before settling into my desk. 11 a.m. \u2014 I work on copy revisions to the sultry tunes of Michael Jackson. I also Gchat with my sister while we iron out the details of a floral design workshop and pop-up flower bar we're hosting this month. These are our first two events for a floral business we recently conceptualized, so it's really exciting to see things actually happening! All about that side hustle, baby. 12:45 p.m. \u2014 After lunch (vegetable wild rice soup), I do a quick Instagram scroll. An ad for Reese's pops up in my feed, and I instantly crave Reese's Pieces, so I grab my wallet to head downstairs to get some. Damn you, Internet. Damn you, Zuckerberg.  $3 Advertisement 3 p.m. \u2014 The combination of drinking coffee at 2:30 and listening to DJ sets on NTS.live has me peddling out copy like a mad(wo)man. I'm typing a million miles a minute and getting ahead on next week's projects \u2014 because, why not? Gotta put this crazed energy to use since I can't be on a dance floor right now. 5:30 p.m. \u2014 I get home from work and am crazy hungry. I make myself a black bean fajita bowl. 7:30 p.m. \u2014 My boyfriend comes over and we head to Midtown to grab dinner and drinks at the bar I used to work at before landing the job I have now. I order a grilled cheese sandwich with apples and honey inside it, and my boyfriend gets spicy chicken nachos. We get a couple flights of beer so we can try a little of everything, and split the tab.  $26.35 9:30 p.m. \u2014 My stomach is killing me. I'm doubled over in pain and can't stand up straight. It's the black bean bowl I ate earlier. It's difficult to take a deep breath. My boyfriend seriously thinks we should go Urgent Care, but that's the last thing I want to do. We were supposed to head to a park downtown for an outdoor pop-up arcade, but we head back to his place instead. I'm sad and also feel bad about abruptly ruining the night, but my BF repeatedly assures me everything is okay. We head up to the third floor \u201cchill room,\u201d put on  X Files , and I take a hit of weed to help with the pain. I stay curled into a ball and end up going to bed around 11:30.

I make myself coffee and an egg sandwich and read a few pages of  You Are a Badass at Making Money . Today we're getting a new stove installed, and my landlord said the guys will be there between 10 a.m. and noon. I clean the old stove and pick up the living room so it'll be easier to install. 11:30 a.m. \u2014 The stove boys show up with a shiny, beautiful, FUNCTIONING new appliance. Yay, so exciting! Our previous stove was getting really sketchy. Sometimes the oven wouldn't turn off, and half the burners didn't work. My landlord shows up, signs the invoice, and leaves my roommate and me to enjoy! 2:30 p.m. \u2014 After showering and getting ready for the day, I drive to CVS to grab film for my camera and then drive over to my boyfriend's house and eat my leftover grilled cheese sandwich. We hop into his car and head to Third Man Records on Cass Corridor to catch our friend's band performing for Record Store Day.  $18.01 4:30 p.m. \u2014 The show is great! We say hi to the band, roam for a bit, and then my BF runs into a group of friends he went to college with. The small talk turns into the group heading across the street for a quick beer and pizza. I buy a pineapple jalape\u00f1o IPA for myself and a double IPA for bae.  $13 Advertisement 5:30 p.m. \u2014 BF and I split off from the group and head to the Nike store downtown. I really want a new pair of sneaks! Unfortunately, nothing really catches my eye (well, there was one pair, but naturally they were the most expensive ones on the shelf and I refused), so we drive back to his place empty-handed. 7 p.m. \u2014 My boyfriend's been acting quiet and weird and totally disconnected all day. He says he's just not feeling very sociable, which is totally fine, but I'm frustrated that he asked me to hang out when really he wants to be alone. I would've been completely fine going solo all day. I'm not on his wavelength currently \u2014 I'm feeling chipper AF and he's bringing me down. I decide to just head back to my place and let him know that we can reconnect later tonight if he feels like joining me. 9 p.m. \u2014 I make myself a buffalo vegan chicken wrap and watch Netflix. BF totally ruined my mood for the day. I'm annoyed and stewing over it, but I really don't want to be. I tell myself to just get over it. In the grand scheme of things, my boyfriend having one mopey day is not the end of the world. We'll have plenty of awesome days in the future, just like always. 10:30 p.m. \u2014 My BF comes back over, so I guess he's ready to socialize again because the plan is to head to one of our favorite dance parties. My roommate and I drink a couple beers and then my BF drives us all to the party. It's a $5 cover to get in. I give my roommate $1 and my boyfriend $2 to help cover their cashless bums.  $8 Advertisement 12:30 a.m. \u2014 We're dancing our asses off, per usual. Our friends host this party on a monthly basis and it's one of my favorites! They spin rap, R&B, and house beats all night and everyone gets hot, sweaty, and sexy funky with each other. I drink two gin and waters but only pay for the second one.  $5 2:30 a.m. \u2014 We get back to my apartment. I wash my makeup off (I refuse to ever sleep with a face full of makeup, no matter how tired, drunk, or lazy I get) and we crash into bed.

He drops off my food and iced coffee before he runs back out to finish the freelance project he's been working on this weekend. I'm still hungry after my egg and cheese croissant, so I eat a bowl of Greek yogurt with protein granola and strawberries. 12:30 p.m. \u2014 After putzing around on the couch for a few hours, I check the weather and see that it's 57 degrees out. I can't let this go to waste! My roommate and I put on jeans and head outside to walk around the city and window shop. 1:30 p.m. \u2014 We stop in a bodega for drinks. My roommate gets an Arnold Palmer and I get a can of coconut water with pineapple. I pay for both of us because there's a credit card minimum and my roommate doesn't have any cash on her.  $1.99 Advertisement 2:30 p.m. \u2014 We check out a vintage store we've always wanted to explore. It's so charming! The building itself is beautiful, and it feels like home inside. I didn't buy anything because I am terrible at making decisions while shopping, but there are amazing vintage purses that I'll be coming back for another day. 3 p.m. \u2014 As we're walking back to our apartment, my BF randomly drives by us honking and waving. He makes a scissor gesture with his hands and I remember he's getting a haircut today, so that must be where he's headed. It was cute to randomly see him driving by! It made me smile. 4 p.m. \u2014 I'm craving Indian food HARD. I would sell a titty for samosas right now, but I know my roommate doesn't like Indian food. She wants lunch from the caf\u00e9 across from our apartment. I order a spicy falafel wrap with extra pickles and a side of cajun fries to go.  $9.46 6:15 p.m. \u2014 I usually grocery shop and meal prep on Sundays, but with the nice weather, I've been putting it off every hour. My plan was to grocery shop and then workout, but the Planet Fitness in Detroit closes at 7 p.m. tonight. FML, guess that's out. I don't feel like grocery shopping today either, so I'll do it tomorrow night. Instead, I go fill up my gas tank ($25.31) and Facebook Cash my boyfriend $15 (he covered a few drinks and snacks this past weekend).  $40.31 Advertisement 7:30 p.m. \u2014 Still upset about not being able to gym it up, I decide to go on a run outside. I last 15 minutes and make it a mile and a half. I'll take it. Plus, it's just so nice to breathe in fresh air and people-watch, look at houses, and let my mind wander while running. Maybe I'll keep trying and get up to 30 minutes one day\u2026and then 45! 8:30 p.m. \u2014 I eat the second half of my falafel wrap from earlier, take a hit of the delicious ganja, and proceed to take a hot and soothing shower. Afterwards, I do a long overdue sink of dishes and clean up my bedroom. 9:30 p.m. \u2014 I put NTS.live on the Bluetooth speaker and do embroidery on a thrifted pair of mom jeans. I'm adding cute little seashells and ocean-themed patches all over them. Not sure if I'll keep them for myself yet or give them to a friend. 11:30 p.m. \u2014 I pull together my outfit for work tomorrow, send a goodnight text to bae, grab my vibrator, and end the week on a high note.

I pour myself coffee while our dog and two cats pace and beg for breakfast, so I feed them and then start getting ready for work. I wake up my husband, M., and our 9-year-old son, J., and get J.'s breakfast started before I leave. Since it's early and I have a long day ahead of me, I swing by Starbucks to grab more coffee. I text a coworker who is meeting me at the office to see if she wants anything. I get a blonde roast with cream for myself, and skinny vanilla latte for her. I use my app to pay.  $7.29 11 a.m. \u2014 We have a lunch event today at work. Yay, free lunch! I have chicken, roasted veggies, a big salad, and a couple mini meatballs. The event is well-attended and since I came in early to set up, a few coworkers step up to break things down and clean up. 3:30 p.m. \u2014 I leave work a little early so I can stop at the grocery store before picking my son up from his after computer class at school. I go to Wegmans and get stuff for dinner and few things we're out of. Rotisserie chicken, lettuce, crumbled blue cheese, and avocado for Cobb salads tonight, plus yogurt, strawberries, turkey, provolone cheese from the deli, sparkling water, and milk.  $44.52 Advertisement 4:30 p.m. \u2014 I have a little time before picking up my son, so I stop at Marshalls to browse. I find a pair of workout leggings that are on clearance and also get a tank. (I need a whole outfit, right?!) I pick up my son and when we get home, he does his homework while I prep dinner. I make homemade salad dressing, boil eggs, and cook bacon in the air fryer (best kitchen gadget, ever). M. gets home from work and takes the dog for a quick walk around the block. (Our pup is getting old and can only handle being out in the cold for a short time before his hips start really bothering him.) When he gets home, he helps me put the salads together and J. sets the table. We eat and clean up, and then M. helps J. with the rest of his homework while I take a hot bath.  $28.25 9 p.m. \u2014 My son goes to bed and M. and I cozy up on the couch to watch Netflix. We want to start a new series but can't agree on one, so we end up watching  Big Daddy  on TV. While half paying attention, I look at my email and see our credit card statement has posted, which means we should now have enough points to pay for a good portion of our plane tickets for our trip to the Bahamas later this year. (We've already booked the resort for four nights.) I hop online and get three roundtrip tickets, and it only costs $203 after points. After the movie is over, I head to bed while M. stays up to watch the end of a hockey game.  $203 Advertisement Daily Total: $283.06", "day_two": "Day Two: 6 a.m. \u2014 My alarm goes off and I'm actually feeling well-rested. I make coffee, feed the animals, and get ready for work. M. gets up and makes J.'s lunch; he asks me if I want anything, but I have lunch plans with a friend today. I wake up J. and help him with his breakfast. We try to teach him independence, because when you have an only child it's easy to just do everything for them, but sometimes it's just faster to help! He wants a smoothie, so we make one with frozen banana, fresh blueberries, strawberries, oats, spinach, plain Greek yogurt, a dash of cinnamon, and drizzle of honey. He loves it and I feel good sending him to school with that in his belly, instead of the Lucky Charms he was begging for! 8:30 a.m. \u2014 In the office I play a bit of catch up, since I was busy all week planning for the event yesterday. The morning goes by quick and I've cleaned out most of my inbox. I head down to the cafeteria to grab coffee. There's free coffee in our building, which isn't great ... but it's free. 12:30 p.m. \u2014 I meet my friend for a belated birthday lunch (mine was over a month ago, but we've been busy!). We go to a new poke bowl place and I order a bowl with cauliflower rice, ahi tuna, cucumber, bean sprouts, avocado, and this delicious spicy ginger soy sauce. My friend pays as a birthday treat! I take a longer-than-usual lunch break, since we're busy catching up. Thankfully, my office is really chill, and as long as I get my work done, my boss doesn't care if I'm not there from exactly 8 to 5 everyday.

I order moisturizer, add mascara, lipstick, and two bubble baths (buy-one-get-one 50% off) to qualify for free shipping.  $58.15 5 p.m. \u2014 Leave the office to head to a barre class. I like to go four times a week, but I've been busy and it's only my first class this week! I get a good workout in (abs were killer today!) and head home for a quick shower before dinner. My husband works from home on Thursdays, so he's in charge of dinner tonight. He makes tacos and they are just what I need. 8 p.m. \u2014 M. is getting ready to go out and meet friends to watch college basketball. His alma mater is in the tournament, so he's pretty pumped. The game is on late, but he's off tomorrow, so he decides to go out. He stops at the ATM to take out $40 for drinks. I put our son to bed early, take a bath (this is my stress reliever almost nightly in the cold months!), and watch  Top Chef.  I'm not super into it, so I mostly text with my friend who is getting married this summer. I'm sending her bridesmaid dress ideas, because she isn't sure what she wants us to wear.  $40 11:45 p.m. \u2014 M. texts me to say the game is over, and he Ubers home ($8.50). I'm in bed already sleeping, but I wake up when he gets home, and he's really excited about the outcome of the game. I really just want to sleep, because I signed up for a 6 a.m. barre class tomorrow and the alarm will be going off in less than six hours.

I pour a coffee to drink on the way to the studio, but it's way too hot and I only have a sip before class starts. 6:45 a.m. \u2014 I make it through my workout and I'm happy that I didn't bail. But I need caffeine, so I stop at a local coffee shop. I order a bulletproof coffee (with grass-fed butter and coconut oil), a muffin for J., and a caramel latte for M. J. is off from school today, so M. is taking the day off to stay home with him. J. is wide awake and playing video games already when I get home, and M. is still in bed (and probably hungover!). I give J. his muffin and tell him to cool it on the games, since it's barely 7 a.m. Take a quick shower, dry shampoo the heck out of my hair, and head to work.  $12.30 11:30 a.m. \u2014 I've been busy all morning and have to work on a project with a coworker. She stops by my office to discuss what we're going to order to eat (ya know, the important things), and we decide on salads from a build-your-own deli bar. We call to place the order, and I get a salad with a spicy buffalo chicken, blue cheese, celery, banana peppers, and balsamic dressing. She orders a salad with salmon, sprouts, cucumber, and feta. I head out to pick them up. I pay, but will expense it, since it's a working lunch. ($32.12 expensed) Advertisement 3 p.m. \u2014 My husband calls me to see if we want to have another couple over for dinner tonight. He offers to shop and cook, and he's already cleaned the house, so I'm all for it! He runs to the store to get stuff for homemade pizzas \u2013 his specialty! I make the dough and he tops the pizzas. I know there are two dough balls in the freezer, so it will be easy. We have a bunch of stuff on hand, so we only need (more) cheese, red onion, mushrooms, and steak, plus stuff for a antipasto tossed salad (romaine, olives, ham, salami, pepperoncini, and canned artichoke hearts). He also grabs a 12-pack of beer ($55.20). I stop and grab two bottles of wine on my way home ($23.14).  $78.34 7 p.m. \u2014 Our friends come over and we have drinks and catch up, and the guys watch basketball. My friend and I put together the salad and keep my son entertained. (They don't have kids yet...so J. has to hang with the adults tonight.) M. cooks the pizzas and everything is really good. I have too much wine before dinner, so I switch to sparkling water while everyone else enjoys a post-dinner cocktail. Our friends brought over cookies from a local bakery, so we each have a few for dessert. I put J. to bed and join the adults for more basketball-watching, though I don't really pay attention. They leave pretty late and I'm exhausted, since I was up so early today!

God bless my son, who woke up and fed the animals, which allowed me to sleep. (The kitten usually pounces on my bed in the morning when he wants to eat.) I don't even care that J.'s likely been up for hours playing video games. I planned to go to a 10 a.m. barre cardio class, but I don't want to rush around, so I cancel and schedule a class for tomorrow at 11. M. wakes up shortly after me (the man would sleep all morning if I let him!) and we talk about our plans for the day. He's going to the gym, doing a few projects around the house, and wants to get his haircut. I tell him he should take J., too. I'm just going to run errands today and then take J. over to my parents' house later for a sleepover. Looking forward to date night! 11 a.m. \u2014 I head out to make a few returns at Kohl's. I have a gift card from a Christmas return, and also a 30% off coupon. I buy sneakers for J. and a long cardigan and bra for myself. After the discount, return credit, and gift card, my total is only $7.18!  $7.18 12:30 p.m. \u2014 Swing into Target for my biweekly trip.

We have late dinner plans tonight with friends, and I know drinks will be involved beforehand. I make myself a late lunch so I'm not drinking on an empty stomach. Taco salad with leftovers from dinner the other night. M. calls to say the barber's credit card machine isn't working, so he asks me to Venmo his barber the money (he's a friend of M.'s). I send the $26 to cover the haircuts, and M. has enough cash to tip.  $26 5 p.m. \u2014 My mom ends up coming to pick up J. for his sleepover, since she's in the neighborhood. M. and I finish getting ready and walk to a local bar to meet our friends for drinks before dinner. It's St. Patrick's Day AND the local college made it to round two of March Madness, so the first bar we go to is packed and full of drunk college kids. We get one drink each and decide we need to find someplace else to hang. M. picks up the round for the four of us.  $33 6:30 p.m. \u2014 We find a quieter bar/restaurant across the street where we have a couple more drinks and watch the basketball game. The drinks are delicious (and not served out of plastic cups, like at the first bar!). I get a gin, elder flower liqueur, and grapefruit drink to start and then a champagne cocktail next. My girlfriend gets a couple mojitos, and the guys drink beer. Our friend buys the next couple rounds of drinks, and we cover the Uber to the restaurant.  $18.55 Advertisement 8 p.m. \u2014 We arrive for dinner and our table isn't quite ready, so yet another round of drinks! The restaurant is really cool. The entire kitchen is open and viewable from the bar, so it's fun to hang and watch the action. Once we sit, we decide to share pickled shrimp as an appetizer. For my entr\u00e9e, I order the truffle mac and cheese and a Caesar salad, which is enough to feed a family, so I share it with the rest of the table. My husband gets the burger and gives me half in exchange for some of my pasta. Everything is delicious. The desserts sound amazing, but we're all so full (of both food and alcohol!), so we get the check and call it a night. We split everything down the middle, since we all had similar items and drinks.

I'm always up for brunch, but we spent a lot of money last night, so I offer to cook at home instead. We agree that's probably a better idea. I take a quick shower while M. makes us Bloody Marys. I make a sweet potato and brussels sprout hash with bacon, onion, and a couple poached eggs on top. It's really good and cures the rest of my hangover. 1 p.m. \u2014 We head over to my parents to pick up J. from his sleepover.

I lose, badly...like always! 6:30 p.m. \u2014 We eat dinner and clean up. I made two big pans of shepherd's pie, so we'll have lots of leftovers for lunch this week. I package up a couple single serving containers for both myself and M. J. gets in the shower and M. makes tuna salad for J. to bring for lunch tomorrow. (He's on a big tuna sandwich kick, and they're a pain to make in the morning while we're all rushing around, so we like to prep the night before.) 8 p.m. \u2014 J. goes to bed early. (He's always exhausted after sleeping over at grandma and grandpa's.) M. and I decide to start watching  Sneaky Pete  on Amazon, and it's pretty good. We watch two episodes before heading to bed. I play around on my phone before I fall asleep and see that I got 40% coupon from Gap in my email. J. needs new school uniform pants because all of his are getting short, so I order him two pairs along with a spring jacket (if spring weather ever comes to Buffalo!). I earn $20 in Gap Cash.  $52.69 Advertisement Daily Total: $215.82", "day_six": "Day Six: 5:45 a.m. \u2014 Monday is the one day I can't be late, as we have our weekly sales meeting. Typical routine of coffee, dealing with the animals, and taking a quick shower. I wake J. up and he pours himself a bowl of cereal. M. gets up and I kiss him goodbye as he jumps in the shower. I actually make it out of the house early today, so I decide to treat myself to Starbucks. I order an herbal tea and pay with my app.  $2.66 8 a.m. \u2014 I try not to fall asleep during the meeting. These things usually last about 45 minutes, or an hour max, but everyone is chatty today and we're in the conference room until almost 10 a.m. I have a call I need to be on at 10:30, so I rush to gather my notes. After that's over, I decide to take an early lunch break because I have errands to run and want to beat the lunchtime traffic. 11:15 a.m. \u2014 I run to the mall because I have a sweater to exchange at Banana Republic, but they don't have it in the size I need. I pick out a different top and get a pair of socks that are on sale near the register. The difference is only $2.87. I then return a coat at Sears that I ordered from Lands End. I really like the coat, but the zipper is a pain in the butt. (I read this in the reviews and should have listened!) The girl who does my return said they've been getting so many returned for the same reason. My credit card will be credited $100.55. While at the mall I have to stop by LUSH for a couple bath bombs. They are my weakness. Since I take baths almost nightly, I can't afford to use them all that often, but I like to buy a couple and save them for splurge nights in the tub! I get three and it sets me back $24.85.  $27.72 Advertisement 2 p.m. \u2014 Back in the office, I finish up my leftover shepherd's pie at my desk. My husband texts me to remind me that we need dog food. I go online to Chewy.com to place an order and decide to get cat food too so that I reach the $50 threshold to get free shipping. I forgot that I have a $20 coupon on my account for a lost item in my last order, so the total is $41.15 after the credit. (Chewy has amazing customer service! Not only did they issue me a refund to my credit card for the lost item, they also gave me a $20 credit for the inconvenience.)  $41.15 3:45 p.m. \u2014 I leave early to get my son off the bus. The bus is late, per usual. Once J.'s home I make sure he eats a good snack, since he has taekwondo at 5:30 and won't eat dinner until after. He has a banana, yogurt and peanuts, which should tide him over for a bit. I drop him off at the gym and go to a local coffee shop to read. (Sometimes I stay at the gym and watch him, but it's always really loud and I have a bit of headache, so I need peace and quiet.) I order a tea ($2.12) and sit by the window. It's freezing outside, but the sun is warm and the vitamin D lifts my mood and helps my headache!  $2.12 6:45 p.m. \u2014 Back home I make omelets for dinner for myself and J. (M. works late on Mondays, so he won't be home until after 8). I put spinach, mushrooms, and Swiss in mine, and ham and cheddar in J.'s. We eat them along with bacon and blueberries. We almost always have breakfast for dinner (\"brinner\") on Mondays, since it's quick after taekwondo. I clean up while J. does homework. When he's done, I let him play video games for a bit if he reads for 25 minutes first. I break out one of my LUSH bath bombs and relax in the tub. Advertisement 8:30 p.m. \u2014 J. gets ready for bed while I fold laundry. When M. comes home from work, he hangs out in J.'s room and chats with him before bed. We retire to the couch and watch last night's episode of  Homeland . I'm ready for bed early, but since M. worked late, he's still wound up from the day, so he heads down to the basement to play guitar.

I make coffee, feed the animals, and let the dog out. J. wants oatmeal for breakfast, so I help him with that. We make a double batch so M. can have some too. I put mashed banana, cinnamon, honey, and vanilla in it. M. wakes up and is appreciative of his hot breakfast. M. leaves to take J. to school and then head to work, and I finish getting ready and head out myself. 9 a.m. \u2014 I get to the doctor on time and wait in the waiting room for a good 20 minutes before being called. Everything is good and I schedule my appointment for my next yearly physical, so I don't forget or skip it! On my way to the work, I stop at the gas station and fill my tank.  $26 1 p.m. \u2014 My officemate and I head down to the cafeteria to eat lunch (more leftover shepherd's pie). We chat about her recent trip to Spain, and I make a mental note to discuss with M. a savings plan to get to Europe ASAP! Advertisement 4:45 p.m. \u2014 Get ready to head out for the day and change for barre class in the office locker room. I'm taking a quick 40-minute express class at 5:15. M. will pick J. up from his after school club and we should all get home around the same time. While I'm waiting for class to start, I check our bank account and see that M.'s expense reimbursement ($268) was deposited from last month. He was traveling a bit, so had more expenses than normal. We use our joint account for almost everything, but each keep a separate card for work expenses, gifts for each other, and other things like that. I text him to tell him to pay off his card. (I keep track of all of our spending and do 99% of the bill paying, but don't have a log-in for his individual card.) 6:30 p.m. \u2014 I pull in the driveway and see that the neighbor's dog is running down the street. He comes running up to me, so I'm able to grab him and walk him home. The owners are so grateful and had no idea that he got out through the fence, AGAIN. Back at the house, the boys have started dinner. We're having leftover chili and cornbread muffins. 9 p.m. \u2014 My BFF texts me that she got her credit card bill from when she bought us Justin Timberlake tickets (the concert isn't until October), so I Venmo her what I owe ($150). M. and I decide to not just veg out in front of the TV for once, so he pours us each a glass of wine and we sit and chat and research a long weekend vacation destination for the summer. We're thinking either Chicago or Montreal, but then table that discussion, because we decide to include J. in the planning. We also want to start planning an adults only, all-inclusive trip for next spring, since M. will turn 40 next year. After looking at beautiful resorts for an hour and reading a bunch of reviews, we've narrowed it down to three. I email a friend who's a travel agent to see if she has any thoughts or other suggestions, and ask what kind of prices she can get us.  $150 11 p.m. \u2014 We head to bed to dream about palm trees and white sand beaches!

His dog eats it in under 10 seconds and looks ashamed but delighted. I leave to the sound of my BF scolding the dog, but secretly I'm cracking up. 8:30 a.m. \u2014 I get to the office and make a hazelnut coffee. (My firm provides free soda, coffee, tea, etc.) I'm not usually a coffee drinker, but I hope the warm drink will make my aching throat feel better. I fill up my water bottle, water my plants, and settle in to get my day started. Advertisement 10 a.m. \u2014 Check my account and notice I was charged for HelloFresh. We get deliveries on Mondays but our order frequency varies depending on our travel plans or if we have lots of social events in the upcoming week. I pay and then split with the BF. We're not very strict about things but try to be equitable and have never had an issue with who pays. He tends to pay more frequently when we go out for dinner and drinks, though.  $59.94 11:30 a.m. \u2014 Go to lunch with a partner and another associate and we talk about projects we have coming up and how to handle work-life balance.

I order a sandwich with sweet potato fries and the partner pays for the three of us. 1:38 p.m. \u2014 Grab candy from our office candy jar. I worry about rotting my teeth out of my head, but it doesn't stop me. 3:10 p.m. \u2014 Take a Diet Coke and then stop to chat with a coworker for five minutes. I am hoping the soda and gossip will wake me up since I'm still not feeling well. 6:30 p.m. \u2014 Leave work and drive over to the BF's place. He owns his house and we usually stay there a few nights a week, at my place a few nights, and then separately at our own places for the remainder of the week. We make a pork noodle dish with kale from HelloFresh. It's a decent version of pho, but I miss the extra sauces and toppings I would get at a restaurant. I wash my hands because I cut up Thai peppers but evidently not thoroughly enough because I burn the crap out of my eyeballs when I take my contacts out.

I get three to four boxes a month with four clothing items in each. I've only had a subscription for about three months and I'm torn about whether I want to keep it. I usually only like three of the four items and they aren't always the highest quality. On the other hand, I do save significantly on dry cleaning and don't have to worry about what to wear in the morning. I feed the dogs and let them out while my BF showers. He's going to drop off the dogs at my apartment on his way to work. We're staying there tonight because we're meeting friends out and I live close to the location. 7:40 a.m. \u2014 Have a granola bar and soda on the way into work. Call BF to see how traffic is since he left before me. He tells me my dog recognizes my voice over the Bluetooth and my heart melts. 10:40 a.m. \u2014 Wrap up the conference call, refill my water, and grab Advil from our office's medicine cabinet for my cramps. Booooo, cramps \u2014 but I'm happy that meds are available to help. 11:50 a.m. \u2014 A client catered lunch for our office today.

One of his coworkers makes a sexist comment to another coworker's girlfriend and she gets ticked off. I don't hear all of it but secretly fist pump when she stands up to him. 10:30 p.m. \u2014 We take an Uber home since we've been drinking. BF pays. We get home, walk the dogs, and go to sleep.

I buy a Diet Coke on the way back to keep me company and spend the next few hours working with  The Lord of the Rings  on in the background. Good add, Netflix!

I buy a wrap and water on the way and eat in the car. I am working with individuals with disabilities to help prepare for an upcoming fundraiser. It's challenging work but I have a great time and start contemplating my ticking biological clock.

In some ways, she's clearly on track to be this powerful and successful woman, but there are also beauty norm issues here. 9:30 p.m. \u2014 I rent a dress from Rent the Runway for a fundraiser my BF and I are going to on Friday night. I feel a little guilty because I already own things I can wear, but I think,  What the hell , and order the dress ($58.20).

This episode isn't as bleak as others so I feel downright cheerful compared to how I usually feel after watching  Black Mirror .

The school administrators also encourage teachers to eat the school lunch with the children to model appropriate eating practices and to socialize with the class. Today's lunch is banana pancakes, corn, strawberry yogurt, and navel oranges. It's tasty, but I know that this vegetarian lunch won't fill me up. 2:30 p.m. \u2014 I recently learned that you can preorder cronuts from Dominique Ansel Bakery! I'm visiting my older brother who lives in New York next month, and while I visit often, I've never had a Cronut because of how quickly they sell out. I am shaking with excitement as I successfully put in my preorder for two.

(Only two out of four teachers in each classroom are required to attend.) The one bright side is that there is always a sweet treat at every meeting, and today there are Girl Scout cookies. I snag a couple of Thin Mints and shortbread cookies for myself and a couple more to bring back to my co-teachers. 3 p.m. \u2014 Since I'm out of work early, I go grocery shopping at Trader Joe's.

It makes me sad to think of how busy everyone's lives are.

The cashier is new and feels bad for holding up the line, so he gives me two extra munchkins for the trouble!

They have a basement with a lot of used books for a decent price. I'm looking for new books for my class because my co-teachers and I are getting tired of the books in our library. I choose  Fancy Nancy and The Posh Puppy . The kids have been loving  Fancy Nancy  lately, and I may selfishly want this one because the book cover is glittery and purple (my fave color). It's half the price of a new book. I'll bring in the receipt on Monday and my work will pay me back. ($5.50 expensed) 2 p.m. \u2014 I'm starving. I make a big pot of pasta again, most likely for the last time this week. 3 p.m. \u2014 I take an Uber to my friend's house in Medford and then she drives us to the movie theater.  $5.58 6:30 p.m. \u2014 OMG  Black Panther  is amazing! On our drive home, we can't stop talking about it. 7 p.m. \u2014 My roommate and her boyfriend are home when I get back from the movies. We talk for a few minutes, since we haven't seen each other all week, but I have to eat and then get ready to go out tonight with work friends. I reheat the pasta, blast the  Black Panther  soundtrack on Spotify, and get dolled up. 8 p.m. \u2014 My friend lives all the way in the North End, and the easiest and quickest way for me to get there is Uber. I feel guilty for spending so much money on Ubers this week, which is very unusual for me. I make a mixed drink of tequila, Sprite, and cranberry juice to bring with me before I go.  $7.30 Advertisement 8:33 p.m. \u2014 This is my first time seeing her apartment, and it's so freaking nice. Her rent is way too expensive for me to afford, but she gets what she pays for \u2013 location, location, location. I meet her friends and we have a low-key night. 10 p.m. \u2014 It's time to go out, and my friend calls the Uber. 11:30 p.m. \u2014 After an hour of waiting in the cold, we pay the $10 cover at the bar and rush inside. First order of business is coat check ($1). We pay and then head to the bar. I suggest we get a round a lemon drop shots. A girl I met at the pregame beelines to the bar and orders the shots as well as two Bud Lights for me and my coworker and a vodka ginger ale for herself. I Venmo her for the drinks.  $25 1:30 a.m. \u2014 We're all feeling tired and ready to go home. The prices for Uber are crazy expensive at this hour, so I opt for Express Pool, which cuts down the cost a lot. I get home just before 2 a.m. and pass out.  $6.97 Daily Total: $72.91", "day_seven": "Day Seven: 9 a.m. \u2014 I take my time this morning and check Instagram, Snapchat, and Reddit before getting up. I go to the living room, where my roommate and her BF are, and we tell each other stories about our nights. 10 a.m. \u2014 I'm super dehydrated, so I get a tall glass of water and then make a cup of tea to have with yogurt for breakfast. I stay on the couch and read two chapters of  Into The Woods . I bought this book last summer and it has taken me a long time to finish it, even though it's really good. Advertisement 11:30 p.m. \u2014 Since, I don't have plans today, it's a good time to clean my apartment. During the week, my bedroom floor is covered with my clothes and shoes. I have a bad habit of throwing them on the floor instead of putting them in the hamper or back in the closet. I end my cleaning spree in the kitchen by washing dirty dishes from yesterday and scrubbing the counters until they're pristine. Cleaning the apartment makes me feel better. 12 p.m. \u2014 As I was cleaning my room, I thought about how many clothes I have in the closet. I'm running out of space and hangers and with spring approaching, it feels like the right time to clean out the closet. I pride myself on making this a biannual routine. I order a donation bag from thredUP. 1 p.m. \u2014 Last month I started watching  Planet Earth II  on Neflix. It's still a mystery how that began, since it's not the usual type of show I would watch, but I'm really into it. I finish the rest of my salad for lunch and watch more episodes from the series. 5 p.m. \u2014 I only get through one episode before zonking out. I take a VERY long nap. I'm surprised by how tired I was! Then I take a shower. 6 p.m. \u2014 Dinner tonight is a frozen bibimbap bowl from Trader Joe's. I make a fried egg to go with it, which makes a huge difference. I watch another episode of  This Is Us  during dinner. Advertisement 8 p.m. \u2014 Before the end of the night, I make overnight oats for breakfast and choose an outfit for tomorrow.

Then I drag him to the gym with me to go to a strength-training class at 9 a.m. I sneak him by the front desk so he doesn't have to pay the obnoxious guest fee. The class includes an ABSURD number of squats and presses, leaving us out of breath and looking at each other with \"OMFG\" faces. Future Instagram fitness models? Probably not. 11:30 a.m. \u2014 J. spends about half the week at my place since he still lives at home far out in Virginia but works in D.C. We go to the Giant near my place so he can get food to keep at my apartment. I pick up coconut milk, frozen corn, kale, and chickpeas for a recipe I'm making, plus a pack of seltzer to keep in the fridge.  $10.95 12 p.m. \u2014 We get back and are starving! We both make eggs and then we move on to the real cooking: I whip up a kale, goat cheese, and corn chickpea cake, a batch of chili for the week, and a banana snack cake that turns green/blue because I use sunflower butter in it (though it still tastes great). J. makes a ton of French toast with a splash of Maker's Mark, which makes it so much better. We bump to J. Cole while we make a mess in the kitchen. Advertisement 2 p.m. \u2014 We pack up the French toast and walk to a friend's apartment. After an intense game of Risk with my boyfriend and roommate last week, J. and I decided we need a game with more strategy and less luck. Our trivia group offered to teach us how to play Settlers of Catan, which we enthusiastically agreed to. We eat French toast and play for five hours straight. J. wins the first game and I win the next two, after lots of strategy and negotiations. (Can you tell we are competitive?) We have an absolute blast and plot when we can play next. 7:30 p.m. \u2014 We get back from our friend's place and J. is starving, so we walk to &pizza to get him food. A friend recommended we try it, and it doesn't disappoint! After walking in the cold, we are ready to bundle in for the night. I want to watch  The Social Network  but can't find it for free, so we settle on  Back to the Future  after realizing neither of us has seen it. We hit the sheets around 11. Daily Total: $10.95", "day_two": "Day Two: 8:30 a.m. \u2014 My alarm wakes us up. I try to keep to somewhat of a schedule on weekends for my sleep so that I don't have too rough of a transition going back to work on Monday. I throw in laundry and then scurry to the gym, happy that it's too early for all the bros to be there. I do some sprints while daydreaming about the food I'm going to eat today. Advertisement 10 a.m. \u2014 J. is still at my place when I get back. I shower and get ready, and then we both help my roommate clean our place a bit. I'm very appreciative of the fact that my boyfriend helps out since he stays at my place so frequently. He's great about cleaning up after himself, chipping in, and bringing us wine/food/etc. I flip my laundry, make scrambled eggs, say goodbye, and then call a Lyft Line to take me Georgetown.  $3.61 11 a.m. \u2014 I meet up with my amazing and lovely friend from work at M Street. We picked an awful day to explore Georgetown, since it's sleeting and about 30 degrees out, but we roll with it. We pop in and out of shops, wistfully dreaming of working for companies like Patagonia or Nike. Then we stop for tacos and talk about what we want to do with our lives and how we will find our purpose. We talk about this almost every day \u2013 we're less than a year into our jobs, but we both know we want to pursue careers that set our souls on fire instead of working in management consulting.  $11.51 1:30 p.m. \u2014 We stop at Baked & Wired and both get cupcakes. We did Whole30 in January and have been looking forward to this for over a month now. She gets the unicorn one and I get a vegan Oreo. I leave half of the cake uneaten because it is so cake-y, but overall the cupcakes are WAY better than Georgetown Cupcakes. I've never understood why the line is always so dang long for those mediocre ultra-sweet cupcakes.  $4.15 Advertisement 2 p.m. \u2014 Our last stop is TJ Maxx, my favorite store. My mother raised me as a Maxxinista, so I love to scout the store for good sales. I snag cashew butter ($5.99), mascara, and Anastasia concealer. Anastasia Beverly Hills is one of my favorite makeup brands, and it is so much cheaper when you don't buy it at Sephora!  $15.30 3 p.m. \u2014 I call a Lyft Line home, and once again am the only person in the car \u2013 score! Once I get home, I meal prep: cauliflower, brussels sprouts, sweet potatoes, chicken, and spaghetti squash. I pack a few meals in Tupperware for the week, jam to Spotify, and prep for work. I also publish a post on my blog. I started blogging after graduation (before I started my job) and find that it's a great creative outlet for me and a fun side project, even if no one reads it except J. and a few friends that know about it.  $3.51 5:30 p.m. \u2014 I pack up and head to my boyfriend's house, driving in a monsoon to get there. I call my mom on the way and we catch up, and then have a hardcore jam session to Cobra Starship. When I was in Warby Parker the other day one of their songs was playing, which reminded me how much I used to love them when I was 14. \"Guilty Pleasure\" is on repeat and I'm singing like I'm on  American Idol , for better or worse.

Daily Total: $38.08", "day_three": "Day Three: 6:45 a.m. \u2014 I wake up and roll out of bed, immediately putting on gym clothes. I use my apartment gym to avoid walking outside in the cold weather. At the gym, I do incline walking and a bit of running. I shower, make coffee, and get ready. I pop an IBS peppermint pill to help mitigate my impending stomachache along with my concoction of vitamins. At 8:20, I hop in my car and put on a podcast. Today's pick:  So Money , a long-time favorite of mine. There's a big car accident so it takes me a bit longer to get to site today. 8:50 a.m. \u2014 I pull up at the same time as my manager, which is great because I'm still waiting for a badge and need to be escorted in each day. I set up in our team room, catch up on news, and figure out what I need to do today. I add some items to my Amazon Subscribe & Save order, which is set to be delivered next week: coffee ($4.96), collagen peptides ($23.76), glutamine ($9.58), Rxbars ($19.95), and BCAAs ($18.01). I use collagen peptides and MCT oil in my coffee each morning. Collagen has made a huge difference for me \u2013 I notice it most clearly in my nail and hair growth.  $76.26 11:30 a.m. \u2014 After a morning of meetings, I shimmy down to the break room to grab my food: tuna, lentil pasta, brussels sprouts, and cauliflower \u2013 random but really good. I do intermittent fasting, so this is my first meal of the day. I put my head down and go back to work until about 3:30, when I heat up chili I brought for lunch. Advertisement 4:30 p.m. \u2014 I leave the client site to drive to our office for a training, parking nearby ($15 expensed). I pick up dinner from a fast casual place rather than eating my sad Tupperware dinner. I get chicken, brussels sprouts, broccoli, and sweet potatoes with a salsa verde. The rest of the night, I feel bad for buying dinner when I easily had food available.  $11.55 7 p.m. \u2014 I sneak out of the training early after thinking about how much I would rather be home. I stop for gas and fill up two-thirds of my tank, following my Dad's advice to never let it get below a quarter tank when it's cold out. Once home, I eat banana cake, clean the kitchen and bathroom, and update my Excel budget. I get everything ready for work and then settle on the couch to watch  This Is Us . I've been mentally preparing all day but still manage to cry three times during the episode. I'm glad no one is around to see me bawling \u2013 sometimes a good cry is therapeutic, but I'd rather do it alone. Afterwards, I crawl into bed with my book ( Lover  by Anna Raverat), and then fall asleep at 9:15.  $20 Daily Total: $107.81", "day_four": "Day Four: 5:40 a.m. \u2014 I wake up to the lingering smell of lemongrass from my diffuser, which was a Christmas gift from my parents. I'm still undecided on whether it makes a difference. I putter around to get my gym clothes on and walk to the gym for a 6 a.m. class. Advertisement 7 a.m. \u2014 Holy. Crap. I walked into the class thinking it was a typical strength training class, but boy was I wrong. It was essentially a combination of Zumba, running, squats, and jumping. For an hour. Everyone in the class seemed totally fine and I was in the corner huffing and puffing, my face bright red. We kept running and jumping and kicking; I didn't think it would end! It was great in an awful way. I'll probably drag myself there again next week. I walk home and notice the beautiful sunrise \u2013 one of the perks of getting up really early. 7:40 a.m. \u2014 I'm all ready for the day and have about 40 minutes before I need to get to work. Most mornings I am running around like a chicken with my head cut off to get to work on time, so this is a refreshing change of pace. Once I'm ready, I read more of  Lover  and drink my coffee out of a mug instead of a travel container. I appreciate drinking coffee leisurely so much more now that I'm working full-time! I toss  Animal Farm  into my bag to read on the metro tonight \u2013 I like to read two books at once, weirdly. At 8:10, my roommate and I walk to the metro together, where we see my boyfriend and another friend of ours from work. We have a great catch up on the ride, debriefing about my roommate's new guy. I'm going to the office today instead of the client site, which rarely happens, but I love when it does. Our office has natural light, usually free food lying around, and free coffee. Advertisement 8:35 a.m. \u2014 Join my team in our room and begin working on client materials for an upcoming offsite we're hosting. I take a break at 9:15 to go to a blind coffee taste test to help pick which coffee our company should use in the machines. The rest of the morning is filled with decks, conference calls, and strategy with the team. At 11:45, I find leftover food outside a conference room and snag eggs. I also eat my first food from home: spaghetti squash, chicken, and saut\u00e9ed veggies. 1:45 p.m. \u2014 The rest of my team is in meetings, leaving my fellow analyst and me in our team room. We chat about life, project work, and consulting in general. Both of us feel like we are either going 100 miles an hour or doing nothing, with little in between. Neither of us knows if this is normal or not, so we text friends and ask their thoughts. We get mixed results back, which provides zero clarity for us. It's nice having someone on my team who is also going through the adjustment from college to working full-time. 3:30 p.m. \u2014 Our contracts are changing at work, so these past few weeks have been incredibly ambiguous and volatile. My team bonds over this with lots of jokes being cracked, which is nice. Today is a slow day: I spend most of the afternoon chatting with my team, reading personal finance articles (I dream of retiring absurdly early), and sending emails. I also up my 401(k) contribution to 6% from 3%; if it's too much I will change it back, but I want to give it a shot to save as much as I can. Advertisement 5:30 p.m. \u2014 I metro into the city for dinner with a friend from work who I don't get to see much, reloading my card on the way ($10). We interned together a couple summers back, so it's always great to see her and catch up. My stomach feels super off, most likely from the beans in the chili I've been eating the past few days, so I order a kimchi bowl for good probiotics. Eating out always reminds me how much food I could buy at the grocery store for the same amount. However, for the good of friendship, I suck it up ($9.51)! After dinner, I pop over to Whole Foods to buy milk (3.49). I metro home, reading  Animal Farm  on my ride.  $23 7:45 p.m. \u2014 Once home, my mom calls and we catch up while I unpack from the day and put on my PJs from Target. (They are seriously the best. They look like leisurewear but also PJs, with jogger bottoms as soft as a baby's butt.) My roommate and I catch up while we eat out of our respective jars of almond butter, talking about wanting to have partners who are equally as ambitious and goal-oriented as we are. I read more of  Lover  while drinking some tea, and consider going to a 6 a.m. yoga class tomorrow. But my desire to sleep in wins. I go to bed at 9:30 p.m. Daily Total: $23", "day_five": "Day Five: 6:45 a.m. \u2014 I refuse to snooze in the morning. I immediately hop out of bed and head to the gym after chugging water. (I drink an absurd amount, gotta keep my skin young and fresh!) Damn, my butt and back are sore from yesterday. I go to my apartment gym and do a simple workout so I don't have to walk through the hail. While there, my friend texts me about the weather delay. I run upstairs and check my work phone to see that there is a two-hour weather delay \u2013 heck yeah! I embrace the delay and work in my sweatpants. Before logging on for the day, I publish another blog post and read a few pages of  Animal Farm . Finally, I update my one-line-a-day journal, which I'm on my fifth (!) year of. I highly recommend it, it's great for reflecting back on the past and remembering what you've been up to in life. Advertisement 10 a.m. \u2014 My manager tells me that it's quiet onsite today so I can work from home the rest of the day if I want. I'm all for it! I make an apple cider vinegar tonic to drink while I work. 11:30 a.m. \u2014 It's very bleh outside, and I'm happy I can work from my apartment. I make veggies and eggs while reading over documents. Making eggs in the middle of a weekday is such a luxury these days, so I savor every bite. I read more personal finance articles and ponder what direction I should take with my own blog. Right now it's just word vomit of my life, from living in D.C. to wellness to personal finance. I have no idea what direction to take with it, so for now I'll just sit on it more and think. While eating lunch, I also shoot a message to the local trivia group to see about hosting \u2013 perhaps it'd be a fun thing to do once a week or so? We'll see! 1:15 p.m. \u2014 More phone calls and decks. (The consulting life!) I use my Chem-X to make pour over. In a moment of stupidity, I place a plastic container on the hot burner and the plastic melts on my stove. My apartment reeks of plastic, and I quickly clean it up to avoid lingering toxic smells in the apartment. D'oh. I have more calls, and find out that the work I've been doing for the past few weeks is essentially obsolete now. I've accepted that part of this job involves doing work that is often thrown out the window, but I don't always like that. I throw myself a two-minute pity party. Advertisement 5:15 p.m. \u2014 Today is one of those days where I look up at the clock and the workday is almost over and my brain really hurts. I put on  This Is Us  while finishing up emails and other random small tasks. Once again, I cry. A lot.  This Is Us  is really just a free form of my own personal therapy. Once I finish up, I bake a banana snack cake (a Pamela Salzman recipe), make spaghetti squash, sauce, and chicken for dinner, and chat with my roommate about work and her upcoming birthday. J. shows up and we chat for a bit before walking to trivia, schlepping through the awful weather. 7 p.m. \u2014 We meet up with friends and commence our trivia effort! We are consistently inconsistent, and tonight we're pretty bad. It's still a ton of fun though and a great thing to look forward to on Hump Day. 9 p.m. \u2014 By round four we are seriously behind, so we all cut our losses and head out. When we get back, J. surprises me with Catan! I'm so pumped \u2013 I had looked into getting it but didn't want to spend the money. We make plans to teach my roommate this weekend after her birthday brunch. We have some fun time and then read in bed before going to sleep. Daily Total: $0", "day_six": "Day Six: 6:45 a.m. \u2014 Up and at it again. I walk on the treadmill since I don't feel like an intense workout, but I love to move my body before work since I sit for so much of the day. I miss walking around a college campus all the time! On my commute I listen to  The mindbodygreen Podcast  episode with the founder of Siggi's. Advertisement 9 a.m. \u2014 I find an empty cubicle and set up shop \u2013 I hate sitting in our team room all day because it's windowless and has bright fluorescent lights. If there is one thing I truly detest in life, it's fluorescent lights. I sit with the lights off near the window (such a luxury!), and work. Our team finds out that our contract is going to be funded, which is a huge sigh of relief \u2013 we thought we'd be losing half of our team. This means my fellow analyst will still be on the team with me, which I'm happy about! 11:15 a.m. \u2014 I heat up oatmeal for lunch, which I made with oats, egg whites (don't knock it 'til you try it \u2013 they make the oats so thick!), coconut milk, ashwagandha, maca, cinnamon, vanilla, and blueberries. I read Money Diaries and more personal finance articles while also thinking of what batch meals I want to make this weekend. 1:40 p.m. \u2014 My stomach is growling, but I'm on a conference call. A teammate sends me the link to the Avett Brothers concert at Wolf Trap this summer, and I immediately text my brother to see if he wants to come to town and go with me. At 2:15 I heat up spaghetti squash, chicken, and veggies. It's a quiet day here and I wish I could work from the comfort of my couch. 4:30 p.m. \u2014 I dip out because everyone of importance on my team isn't around. I call my mom on my drive home \u2013 I really miss seeing her on a regular basis and love talking to her pretty much every day. We're very close and I love having the ritual of calling her on my ride home. Once home, I take my last work call of the day. After eating cashew butter and banana cake, I go down to the gym and walk while finishing my book to get more steps and movement in. Advertisement 6:15 p.m. \u2014 J. arrives and we have a heartfelt discussion. He's really committed to our future, and it's not that I'm not, but I feel so young to commit one way or another and don't want to make decisions now when I don't need to. I've talked before about wanting to leave D.C. and live in other cities while I'm young, which makes J. nervous. It's complicated, but we have a good discussion. After, we eat dinner (eggs, veggies, and tortillas with hot sauce) and then I succumb to a Hulu trial subscription. I've been wanting to rewatch  Desperate Housewives,  and J. gives in and watches with me \u2013 we get through two episodes and he's hooked! While we watch, I do a watercolor painting. We climb into bed around 9:30 and read and unwind before going to sleep. Daily Total: $0", "day_seven": "Day Seven: 6:45 a.m. \u2014 I wake up and head to the gym. After that I decide it's worth being a few minutes late to work to make J. a PB&J for him to take on his commute. 9 a.m. \u2014 On my way to work I listen to a new podcast I love called  Women's Work , which J. recommended to me. This episode features Gretchen Rubin, who I LOVE! I'm a personal development junkie so I love learning about habits, happiness, and human nature. 11:45 a.m. \u2014 Sitting in a windowless, fluorescent-lit room kills my spirit. Sigh. I eat tuna (not in the team room, to prevent smelling), and a medley of veggies for my first meal. Advertisement 2 p.m. \u2014 I run out to get coffee for my manager and myself in an attempt to mitigate my headache. Sadly, it doesn't help, and now I'm stranded outside the building waiting for someone to come get me. My teammates are all in meetings/on calls, so I stand outside for about 20 minutes enjoying the sunshine and going through email. I drink my cold brew too quickly and get the shakes, UGH! This happens every time, and I never learn. Eventually, I am rescued. ($8.47 expensed) 3:30 p.m. \u2014 I have a pounding headache still. I give in and take Motrin, and then eat my desk lunch of spaghetti squash, chicken, and veggies. I'm still hungry so I eat a Larabar too. Can I go home yet? 6 p.m. \u2014 I get home from work with a bad headache, so I skip yoga and bake cupcakes for my roommate as a post-birthday brunch treat. I don't have muffin liners and the cakes get crumbly, so I turn the cake into cake balls, but realize I need butter for frosting. J. and a friend come over, and I offer to drive his friend home. I pick up butter, sprinkles, and eggs on my way back.  $10.53 9:30 p.m. \u2014 J. and I split a Lyft to a housewarming party hosted by some of our college friends.

If I don't go before work, I know I wont go at all! When I get home, I make breakfast (coffee and apple chia oatmeal) and prepare my lunch for the day. 8:35 a.m. \u2014 Off to work! I've been working at this organization for the last six months. My executive director can be a drag but I really love our mission and my other coworkers, so they help make up for it. My MetroCard ran out last Friday, so I refill it for another 30 days. 12:15 p.m. \u2014 I eat lunch in my office (chickpeas with a tomato sauce and cabbage salad on the side) and read Money Diaries. I limit eating out to twice a week because restaurants are so expensive here and, for some reason, I can't seem to spend less than $25 every time I go out to eat. I also love to cook, so I don't mind bringing my own food for lunch every day. 4 p.m. \u2014 I accidentally had a package sent to my last address in Boston and one of my old neighbors was kind enough to help me out by sending it to my Brooklyn address. I Venmo him for the cost of shipping.  $12.80 7 p.m. \u2014 Get home feeling kinda meh (hello pre-period hormones!), but am pleasantly surprised to see that I got a letter from my grandfather in the mail. He lives in Paris, so I don't get to see him too often, but I'll be visiting in April and am so excited to spend time with him and my grandmother. I found roundtrip tickets for only $250 a few months back and bought them because it was too good a deal. I make a mental note to write him back ASAP.

I later get a phone call from my ex in California \u2014 we broke up eight months ago, but we're still friendly and chat on the phone once every few months. It makes me miss him (dammit!), especially considering we only broke up because we were moving to different places after college. I've gone on a few dates since we broke up, but all the guys ended up being dicks. I think it's a New York thing. Lately, I've been focusing on myself and have made a point not to look for dates. I've been feeling really great recently without the pressure of finding anyone. Self love FTW! We chat for an hour before I go to bed at 10.

My roommate leaves early for work today so I have the place to myself for a solid hour. I know I pay a lot for rent, but I absolutely love my apartment: We have a huge sliding door window with a view of Manhattan, a balcony, and huge rooms. It's the perfect place to relax after being in the hustle and bustle of Manhattan all day. 12 p.m. \u2014 It's been pretty slow today because both my supervisor and executive director are out of the office. I eat lunch (leftover dumpling soup that I added chickpeas to) and read some  New York Times  articles, including a really interesting one about the fruit/vegetable shortages in Alaska during the winter. I am so privileged to have access to a year-round farmer's market, which is why I'm happy to spend a little extra to support my local farmers. Advertisement 1:45 p.m. \u2014 I'm still kind of hungry from lunch, so I cut up an apple I brought and munch on it while working on invitation designs. I bought a half bushel of barely bruised apples (around 20 pounds) for $12 at the market on Saturday and have been eating them nonstop. 3:30 p.m. \u2014 Get an email from ClassPass about a 70% off discount. I've been wanting to try it to take fun classes, since I just lift weights with minimal cardio at my old school gym. I decide against it for now but resolve to sign up the next time a good discount comes around. 4:30 p.m. \u2014 I get to leave an hour early from work, hooray! I rush home so I can take advantage of this strangely warm weather. I sit on my balcony and continue reading  Outliers  by Malcolm Gladwell. For the last few years, my New Year's resolution has been to read at least 25 books over the course of the year. With all my commuting, I've been able to get so much reading in! It's gorgeous outside and I start to feel so nostalgic for summer. 6:30 p.m. \u2014 I roast potatoes for dinner and add homemade sunflower seed \"cheese\" from making sunflower seed milk (which is way cheaper than almond) over the weekend and devour it while watching YouTube videos. After finishing dinner, I am craving something sweet but don't have a ton of snacks because I try to live zero waste and tend not to buy pre-packaged stuff. I end up mashing sweet potato and topping with cinnamon and maple syrup. It's certainly not ice cream, but it does the trick.

I usually ask for a spotter because I'm benching pretty high (105!), and after a few rounds, one of the guys spotting me takes weight off the bar without asking and says I should go lighter. I would usually brush this off, but I've been feeling serious microaggressions from men lately and this really bugs me. I breeze through the lighter set and walk away. 7:15 a.m. \u2014 When I get home, I shower, make apple chia oats (creature of habit), and drink chai with sunflower seed milk. My roommate went out to dinner last night so I didn't get to see her before bed, but we chat a bit this morning before she heads off to work early. 12:30 p.m. \u2014 I heat up my lunch (sweet potato with chickpeas and spices) and decide to go into my office's conference room to eat and read my book. Ideally I'd be having lunch in Central Park, but it's grey and drizzly today. 1 p.m. \u2014 Back at my desk with apple chia pudding. I'm meeting a friend for dinner later and have zero intentions of eating healthy tonight, so I'm getting in nutrients while I can. 6 p.m. \u2014 I randomly run into this guy I went to college with and we chat for a few minutes as we get out of the subway. This is probably the seventh or eighth time I've run into someone I know in NYC, and it's still so insane to me every time it happens, especially considering I grew up in Texas. The guy gives me his number just before we part ways, and I plan on inviting him over the next time my roommate and I throw a party.

We catch up on each other's lives since we haven't seen each other in a few months, and end up sharing a coconut milkshake with avocado, lime, and coconut flakes that tastes like key lime pie.  $23 8 p.m. \u2014 When I get home, I have two packages waiting for me! The first is a wooden frame for a poster in my room and mesh produce bags, and the other is a stainless steel French press I ordered because I broke my glass one over the weekend. When my roommate gets home, we do clay face masks (she works in beauty and gets tons of free products) and watch more  Imposters.  I go to sleep around 11.

I get up to make breakfast and decide to boil potatoes for potato salad with a Dijon vinaigrette that I'll bring for lunch. 8:45 a.m. \u2014 While waiting for the train, I run into other friends from college (!) and chat with them until we get to our stops. We haven't seen each other in a while, so we talk about our jobs, my friend's experience in graduate school, and my sustainability blog. One of them asks to come to the farmer's market with me sometime soon and I happily say yes \u2013 I usually go by myself but love to have company with me! Advertisement 12 p.m. \u2014 I eat potato salad with half an avocado I brought from home while attempting the  New York Times  crossword puzzle. My roommate texts me and asks if I want to go out for dinner tonight with her friends, and while I'd rather not spend money since I have food at home, she pressures me into it. I've spent less money than usual this week, so I don't mind too much. 3 p.m. \u2014 I see a theater matin\u00e9e today (work perk) and get to leave a few hours early from work! The show we see is very strange and I don't understand a thing, but it's interesting to see the story unfold. Afterwards, I head home, since I have time to kill before meeting my friends for dinner. 6:15 p.m. \u2014 There's a homeless man on the train asking for money, and while I usually prefer to give food, I don't have any on me, so I give him a dollar. I didn't grow up in a place with so many homeless people and it's heartbreaking, so when I have the opportunity, I like to help.  $1 6:30 p.m. \u2014 I get to the restaurant and meet up with my friends, but the place is super crowded so we end up going to another sushi spot a couple of blocks away. My roomie buys me a beer (I think she feels bad for pressuring me to go to dinner, but I gladly accept) and I order miso soup, a veggie California roll, and a sweet potato tempura roll. Before we all leave, she gives us gifts from her work: samples of a very chic perfume from one of her clients! It smells like spring and I'm so excited to wear it once the weather gets warmer.  $14 Advertisement 8:30 p.m. \u2014 Right as we're about to catch the train home, my roommate's boyfriend calls and asks if we want to go meet him for drinks.

I've gotten into a Saturday morning routine that I look forward to every week: wake up, hit the gym, come home and shower, eat breakfast, and take the bus (or walk if it's nice outside) to the farmer's market. It looks like it might rain soon, so I decide to walk along the bus route just in case I want to hop on. I bring my week's compost and a ton of reusable bags so I'm totally prepared. The rain holds off so I walk the hour there while listening to music. 11:30 a.m. \u2014 I get to the market and it's super busy. The weather is nice, so lots of folks bring their dogs and I even spot an actress from  Orange Is the New Black ! I buy red potatoes, sweet potatoes, mushrooms, bread, onions, a vegan chocolate chip cookie, and a beet, and put in another order for a half bushel of \"imperfect\" apples from the apple farmer. Americans waste nearly 40% of food, so I like buying fruit that otherwise wouldn't get sold. Hooray for saving money and the planet! I have plenty of dry goods like beans, rice, and oats left from a bulk trip last week, so this week's grocery haul is somewhat inexpensive. I usually spend around $50 per week.  $27.80 Advertisement 3 p.m. \u2014 I make avocado toast for a late lunch with roasted butternut squash that I have leftover from last week. The roomie and I watch the rest 0f  Imposters  and try to wrap our heads around the ending. It's kind of confusing and we are hoping to get more answers when the next season comes out. 7:30 p.m. \u2014 I make pasta with the last of the homemade tomato sauce I froze from the summer. It's so much better than premade sauce, and I got a huge discount on bruised tomatoes from the market back in September. I watch some episodes of  The End of the F**king World , scroll through Instagram, and do remote work for a co-op that I'm a member of. Chill night overall, and I'm in bed by 10:30.

My tenth book of the year! 10:30 a.m. \u2014 Head off to the gym for leg day and then come home to shower and get ready for lunch with my roommate's mother and grandmother. They're stopping by our place for bellinis beforehand, so we make sure to deep clean the apartment so we look like responsible adults. 2:45 p.m. \u2014 We decide to go to Forrest Point in Bushwick, and I order a Mediterranean plate with Israeli salad, pita, hummus, harissa, and potatoes. I love my roommate's family and really enjoy chatting with them. Her grandmother treats us.

I listen to music while getting ready for work. 10:30 a.m. \u2014 My executive director brought back pecan pralines from her trip to New Orleans and even got a few vegan ones especially for me! They're super delicious, and the southern treat really reminds me of home. 12:15 p.m. \u2014 I heat up my lunch (apple chia oats) and read articles while listening to music. I also start writing down cool restaurants I want to try when I visit Paris. That's another reason I'm trying to save up \u2013 I don't want to feel deprived while I'm there! While I definitely plan on having inexpensive picnics, I also want to try some of their fine foods apart from just baguette and salad.

When I get home, I check my mailbox and see a letter from my mom, who sent me a $25 Target gift card she wasn't planning on using. She is such a sweetheart and I feel like we've become extra close the last few years, which I love. 7 p.m. \u2014 I roast potatoes and a beet and listen to an old Drake album. While that's roasting, I prep cabbage salad for the week as well as more sunflower seed \"milk.\" I make more vegan cheese with the leftover pulp and add it to my roasted potatoes.

As someone who freelances a lot, it's hard not to treat freelance income as \u201cfun money\u201d and not budget appropriately with it. To get over this, I'm really trying to only buy things I love and can't stop thinking about buying. So far this month, I've bought a pair of pants from Everlane that I think I'll wear all spring and summer. (I've officially decided I can no longer wear short shorts on a regular basis. RIP.)

I interned at a lingerie brand when I was in college (it was a total nightmare) but it instilled a love of nice undergarments in me. There's a lovely boutique down the street from my office.

Also, crumpets for breakfast, because they're so good. We split it evenly.  $25 7 p.m. \u2014 Back home, we get cooking while watching mindless television. It's an easy recipe with a long cook time (about an hour and a half), so we want to get things going as quickly as possible. 9:30 p.m. \u2014 After dinner, we rent a movie on Amazon Prime through our Roku.

I've been hooked on cooking shows lately, even though I would never bother to make any of the recipes. I finally get up and make breakfast: eggs, garlic rosemary potatoes, and toast for my boyfriend and me. I'm not usually a big breakfast eater, but I'm hungry today. Then I get myself ready for the day and run errands. 12:15 p.m. \u2014 I spent most of the day yesterday working on our house, and need to get a few things to tie together the bathroom I just painted. The house is from the 1920s and I love the charm its age brings, but one downfall is the super tiny bathrooms. First stop is HomeGoods to find a new shower curtain. I don't find one I like, but I pick up new kitchen towels ($10), a utensil holder ($9.99), and a shower curtain liner ($5.99). Next stop is a little Mexican place close to my house that makes amazing guacamole ($3.02). We're going to a friend's place later and I'm bringing chips and guac.  $29 1 p.m. \u2014 Next, I stop by Target and score a curtain on sale ($7.48), plus a few groceries, including a bag of Sour Patch Kids ($15.78).  $23.26 4:55 p.m. \u2014 Arrive at my friend's home, which is about 20 minutes away. It's beautiful, but something about a neighborhood where all the houses are identical except for their varying shades of beige kinda creeps me out.

Quickly get in the shower, get ready, and make a quick smoothie of frozen cherries, half a banana, almond and coconut milk, and a bit of organic yogurt. It's delish! Pack that to bring along to work, feed the pup, and head out the door. I have a half hour commute in, so I finish my coffee on the road. 11:35 a.m. \u2014 Lunch is being catered today and I wander down to find food. I get a house salad, fruit, and a roll \u2014 I don't know who picked the restaurant but the food is terrible. As predicted, I'm starving by 2 p.m. But, hey, it was free. 5 p.m. \u2014 I make a quick payment on my credit card before leaving the office ($142). I try to use credit cards for almost all purchases and then pay my entire balance each month. It feels safer than using my debit card, and I like the bonus of getting points and cash back. My commute home is annoying and takes longer than usual. I'm really hungry when I get home and immediately inhale leftover chicken tacos with cilantro lime rice. YUM.

I have a meeting right at noon, so I heat up my leftover chicken and rice to eat at my desk a little early today. Advertisement 4:38 p.m. \u2014 Leave the office and go to a friend's birthday dinner. We're meeting at a Russian restaurant in St. Paul, so it's a bit of a trek. On my way, I buy a nice bottle of sparkling wine ($33) from a nearby wine shop. I arrive 15 minutes late per usual, but no one minds. I order a Moscow Mule and chicken Kiev for dinner ($38). It's tasty and the portion is huge, so I plan to bring half home. I have a great time and get to try a new place, which I love to do.  $71 8:50 p.m. \u2014 Back at home, my boyfriend is finally replacing the light in the bathroom.

I check my personal email and notice an email from my doctor's office letting me know about a bill I need to pre-pay, which catches me by surprise a little. I'm going through IVF and recently had my egg retrieval, but I ended up having to freeze all the eggs due to being overstimulated. I wasn't expecting an extra cost for that, so I'm feeling a little bummed out. The process has been pretty intense, physically and financially. I make the payment so we can schedule the frozen transfer and send an email to the business office.  $2,750 Advertisement 1 p.m. \u2014 I heat up my leftovers for lunch today and they're a little dry.

I have a long meeting at 9 that ends early (yay!), so I'll have a little more time to work on other projects. I take a minute to make a quick payment on my Nordstrom card ($187). I bought a new Rebecca Minkoff laptop bag on sale last month. I'm trying to get better about spending on things I want versus need, and this was a little slip up.  $187 12:20 p.m. \u2014 A coworker asks if I want to grab lunch; since I didn't bring anything with me today, I'm game. We end up at Crisp & Green, which I haven't tried before. I get the fiesta bowl with chicken, black beans, avocado, peppers and brown rice. The bowl is good and large, so I save almost half for tomorrow.  $12.51 Advertisement 1:30 p.m. \u2014 Back at work, I remember it was my mom's birthday earlier this week.

I make pasta often because its so easy and I love it. Chat with the boyfriend about a call I had with my doctor's office. I'm so over this IVF process and just want it to be done.

I'm up a little earlier than usual today because I have an early meeting, at least a half hour away. I arrive right on time and work from there until about noon. I decide not to go into the office and work from home for the rest of the day. I swing by the car wash on my way back, which I've been putting off for too long. My SUV is covered in salt and dirt. I wait in line for roughly 30 minutes but in the end it's worth it. I was starting to forget what color my vehicle was!  $11 6 p.m. \u2014 My sisters swing by my house at 6 p.m. because we're going to a visitation for my aunt's ex-husband, who just passed. I haven't seen him in many years but we want to show support for the family. We bring a card and I contribute money.  $10 Advertisement 8 p.m. \u2014 The event is nice and afterwards, we're hungry, so we go to a bar to meet up with friends and grab a snack.

I spend a good part of the morning snuggling with my pup and drinking coffee. At 10:30 a.m., I finally get up to make breakfast. My boyfriend is working on the house, so I make us eggs and breakfast potatoes. Then it's back under the blankets on this freezing cold morning to go shopping online. I'm looking for storage cabinets and a new vanity for my bathroom. Nothing is really doing it for me, and it doesn't help that my options are limited because my bathroom is so small. I also look on Google Flights for weekend trip ideas. I'm dying to get out of this miserable weather and I need sun! It's mostly wishful thinking, though, as I likely won't have time in between upcoming work trips. 5 p.m. \u2014 I spend the rest of the day cleaning my house and attempting to clean out my closet (rather unsuccessfully). We get sushi for dinner and order our usual spicy tuna, California roll, and shrimp tempura to-go from a little place by our house that we love. I also get the green curry with shrimp because I love having leftovers and their curry is so good and spicy. My boyfriend picks up the food and pays, and we spend the rest of the evening drinking wine and watching hockey.

Make coffee in my French press and take my meds while I wait for the conference call to start. 7:30 a.m. \u2014 The call is for a service club that was created to help the organization I work for, and as usual, I wonder why I'm on it. I never contribute anything, so joining them each month feels a bit pointless to me. Still, the club itself is fantastic and does great work, and I don't have complaints about that. During the call, I keep myself on mute and check my bank account. I see that our immigration checks have cleared and am over the moon! Our first application was rejected because of bounced checks, so this is a huge deal. 8 a.m. \u2014 Leave for the office a little late. 9 a.m. \u2014 The team meets to discuss our upcoming summer camp, which is going to be wonderful this year (mainly because we are all on the same page about everything). 10:25 a.m. \u2014 Start contacting my families to check in with them. There's one in particular that my manager wants to make sure we help. 11:30 a.m. \u2014 Tell my manager I'm leaving for lunch and she stops me to discuss my impending move. Basically, she doesn't think I'm ready yet (neither do I) and says there are a lot of factors that need to be reviewed and discussed beforehand, which I completely agree with. Eventually, I leave and go to McDonald's, where I order a 10-piece McNugget combo with a Coke.  $6.47 Advertisement 12:45 p.m. \u2014 Back at the office.

They're a lot of help, and I grab a water bottle from the office fridge. 12:15 p.m. \u2014 My manager goes home for the day since she's feeling sick, and I go to Starbucks for Double-Star Day. I already need to reload my card again (that was fast!) and put another $10 on it. Then I go to McDonald's (again) and order a 10-piece nugget and fries.

It's great news: the judge reduced my speed to nine miles per hour over the limit and my insurance may go up, but that's it! No driving school, suspension, or anything major, which I was nervous about \u2014 I'm thrilled. I call my husband to tell him, but he doesn't pick up.

At some point, I stop at McDonald's for a biscuit, two hash browns, and a latte, though none of it is very satisfying.  $8.50 11:35 a.m. \u2014 Take a break to visit a friend who's still in college at her apartment. We talk about random stuff and our plans for tonight; her dad is coming to town and wants to take us to dinner. The timing still isn't set, so I tell her to let me know when my husband and I should get to her apartment later. I stop at the McDonald's near the complex for fries and a Coke to try and make up for yesterday's letdown. From there, I get back on the road. I'm not as busy as before, but I still get some rides here and there.  $3.12 Advertisement 2:55 p.m. \u2014 Get home and I'm exhausted, so I opt for a nap before getting ready for dinner. It goes longer than planned and when I wake up, we're rushed. 5:15 p.m. \u2014 Feed and walk the dogs before I go to Greenville. 7 p.m. \u2014 Go to dinner at a very fancy restaurant in downtown Greenville and it's AMAZING! We order two bottles of wine, split two appetizers of beef tenderloin bites and crab dip, each order an entr\u00e9e (I order the coq au vin), and share sides of asparagus, gouda mashed potatoes, and mushrooms. To top it all off, we share tres leches cake and cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e. My friend's dad pays. 10 p.m. \u2014 Husband and I head home, not realizing how late it is! We stop at my boss' house to walk the dogs one more time, but my husband tells me to go home and says he'll do it for me; he's the best. I have trouble getting to sleep, so when he comes home, he joins me in bed and helps me doze off.

I drove home from a conference in New Haven, CT, last night in the middle of a snowstorm, so it took longer than expected. I was completely exhausted by the time I got home, and would have liked to spend all day lazing around today. Instead, I shower and head into the city on an 11:30 a.m. bus (using my monthly pass) to meet a friend for brunch before she heads back to her new home in Colorado. Because of my conference, I barely got to see her while she was here, so I don't mind making the trip into the city for such a short amount of time. We get bagels and another friend pays, because she's still chipping away at paying me back for a concert ticket I bought her about a month ago. After the bagel, we decide that we can call it even now. 3:30 p.m. \u2014 Back from the city. I stop by ShopRite on my way home to grab a few things for my mom \u2013 red and green grapes, salad greens, limes, and a small tub of vanilla ice cream. I throw in tampons for myself ($8.99).  $25.67 7:30 p.m. \u2014 We squeeze in dinner after my mom gets back from tennis and before my dad leaves for hockey (my parents are honestly more active than I am). My grandparents are here (and staying overnight) and we're teaching my grandmother how to use her new iPhone. She's learning pretty quickly, but is having a hard time with the touch-screen keyboard. Dinner is sheet pan chicken and chickpeas, with chocolate chip banana bars and a scoop of ice cream for dessert. After dinner we do more iPhone tutoring until everyone starts to get a little testy and we call it a night.

My measly salary is slightly offset by my great time-off package \u2013 we get 11 paid holidays, 15 days of paid vacation, four personal days, nine sick days, and three summer Fridays each year. Breakfast is bagels and lox (supplied by the grandparents), and I chat with my grandma about her feelings of stagnation in her old age. It's pretty depressing. 11:30 a.m. \u2014 Grandparents head out the door. I love them, but one night with them was plenty. I do a 40-minute YouTube yoga video and shower. Then I get started on my taxes \u2013 I'm filing for the first time. I get held up when my dad tells me he isn't sure whether or not he and my mom are claiming me as a dependent this year. I'm already in the financial zone, so I pay my credit card bill and my student loan, even though the payments aren't due for another week. I like to make the payments early in case any issues come up. 3 p.m. \u2014 Time for grocery shopping. The drive to Trader Joe's is only 15 minutes, but it always takes at least another 10 to find a parking spot. I stock up on food for the week, including salmon filets, baby bok choy, snow peas, sweet potatoes, coconut milk, Thai green curry simmer sauce, anchovies, goat's milk gouda, cilantro, a loaf of multigrain sourdough, half and half, a bunch of KIND bars, Cheddar Rockets, and peanut butter pretzels (work snacks are a necessity for me). My family likes to shop at different grocery stores for different items (TJ's produce is usually not ideal), and whoever is doing the shopping pays.  $63.52 Advertisement 4 p.m. \u2014 I manage to sneak in an episode of  Grey's Anatomy  before a friend of mine arrives for dinner.

I arrive at work at 9 (the commute is strangely smooth today), put my snacks in my snack drawer, make myself tea, and heat up oatmeal I brought from home. I eat breakfast while catching up on the news from the weekend. 1 p.m. \u2014 I catch up on emails and putting out small fires until lunchtime. While some of our clients are very self-sufficient, others are more needy and require assistance with every last detail of their cases. It's easy to get frustrated, but I remind myself that financial literacy is not a privilege that all people enjoy. For lunch, I eat leftover pasta and cauliflower from last night while reading up on the options for my next book club meeting. (I'm in a book club with a group of coworkers who are all great.) We all work at the same level in our organization, so our monthly meeting is also a nice time to catch up on and complain about work stuff. I decide that I'm voting in favor of  Parable of the Sower  by Octavia Butler. I love reading, but watching TV is just easier \u2013 so my book club is a great way for me to keep it balanced.

Being a nonprofit, we don't usually get free food. (In fact, our office doesn't even have a coffeemaker.) Work is slow and I'll be eating a light dinner tonight, so I swing by and pick up a turkey and cheese sandwich.

It's 75 degrees today \u2013 I almost feel like a real human again! Lunch is TJ's chicken tikka masala, which I'm trying for the first time. It isn't terrible, but also not great or particularly healthy. I promise myself I'll actually make lunch for the rest of the week. 3:30 p.m. \u2014 I leave the office for a long overdue performance review with my supervisor, who graciously buys iced tea for both of us before we head to the park (twice in one day!). I was really nervous for this because he's difficult to read, but it turns out he's been very happy with my work thus far! I've been working here for about seven months now with little feedback, so it's nice to have this affirmation. I also work up the courage to express that I feel capable of taking on more work, and he responds immediately by sending a few more cases my way. I'm back at my desk by 4:30 to finish up a few things, and out of the office a little after 5.

I usually like to vary my exercise between cardio at the gym, workouts from the Nike Training app, and yoga, but my knee has been hurting lately, so I'm trying to minimize impact. My parents still aren't home when I'm finished, which is typical for my mom but not so much my dad. He had a heart attack about a year ago and is doing much better now, but I still tend to panic whenever he's unaccounted for. A text confirms that he's just held up at the fish counter at Whole Foods, picking up salmon for dinner. When he gets home, I whip up a miso glaze for the fish, plus green beans saut\u00e9ed with ginger and garlic and white rice. I've really tried to get on the brown rice train, but I just can't. (Actually, in all honesty, I haven't tried that hard.) There are leftovers, so I get away with not having to make lunch for another day.  $6.08 11 p.m. \u2014 Restock on my face cleansers on Amazon.

I have grand fantasies of going to the gym before this week is over\u2026we'll see if that pans out. I'm going to a Phoebe Bridgers concert with two friends tonight but I don't really know her music too well, so I listen to her top songs on Spotify on my commute. I also listen to the Sufjan Stevens songs from the  Call Me By Your Name  soundtrack. Why do I do this? Starting off the day emosh, I guess. I'm at work by 9:25 (traffic is not great today), make myself tea, and munch on a KIND bar for breakfast. Advertisement 12 p.m. \u2014 Early lunch today. I'm heading to a satellite office we have at a courthouse in Brooklyn to help translate for another one of our projects with a Spanish-speaking client, and I want to leave my desk by 1:30. I'm excited for the chance to get out, since I didn't make it to my project's weekly court clinic on Tuesday and I really like my coworkers at the satellite office. I heat up my leftover salmon and rice, do the crossword mini, and finish this week's episode of  The Bachelor . If I believed in guilty pleasures,  The Bachelor  would be mine, but I don't! Why should I be guilty for liking what I like? 5:45 p.m. \u2014 I make it back to my office by 5 and finish up a few things before heading out to Williamsburg to meet my friends for dinner. We eat at Vanessa's, a cheap but reliable dumpling spot near the concert venue. One friend pays for dinner and the Uber to the venue (it's walking distance, but not in the cold and rain).

I'm definitely not hungover, so I attribute it to a lack of sleep. I make it to the office by 9:45, eat a rice cake with peanut butter and honey, and start my work day. 4 p.m. \u2014 I decided to work through lunch today so I can leave the office early. I had plans with a friend to go to the gym together after work, but we both decide we'd rather be horizontal. I swing by Whole Foods to kill time while I wait for her to get off work and get something substantial to eat: rice, chana masala, and a samosa from the hot bar ($8.01). We decide on homemade pizza for dinner since she already has dough, so I grab a can of diced roasted tomatoes, a bag of shredded mozzarella, two bags of frozen broccoli, a toffee and sea salt chocolate bar, and raspberries ($21.70).  $29.71 5:30 p.m. \u2014 After meeting on the train, my friend and I finally get home.

She makes me watch the pilot of  The End of the F***ing World , which I end up loving, so we watch another two episodes while making and eating dinner. We decide tonight is a night to be stationary drunk, and three other friends join us. We get to sleep around 1:30.

My friend and I go for a walk so we can get time outside before it starts to rain, and pick up a breakfast sandwich and a salad at a caf\u00e9 to bring home and share. (She pays.) We make coffee and chat while we eat, and then watch a couple episodes of  Queer Eye . After that we do a 35-minute yoga video together, and then take turns showering. I spend so much time at her apartment on the weekends, I should probably be paying her rent. 5:30 p.m. \u2014 We leave my friend's apartment to meet more people for dinner, and make it to the restaurant around 6:40. We grab drinks while we wait for a table, and I pay for two friends' drinks to make up for the Ubers on Thursday and breakfast from this morning.  $29 9:30 p.m. \u2014 After dinner and a stop at another bar (where I don't get anything), I head to Port Authority (ew) to catch the bus home to Montclair (paid for with my monthly pass). I like to sleep in my own bed for at least one weekend night. I FaceTime with my GF for a while, trying to iron out dates for our trip to Spain this summer. We found a flight for under $500, so I want to buy tickets ASAP. We catch up on the mundane details of each other's' lives until we both get too sleepy.

I clean the kitchen a bit and listen to a podcast while I wait. When the chicken is done, I shred it and add Frank's Buffalo Sauce before putting it back in the oven. In another dish, I cut up the head of broccoli and add lemon juice, olive oil, red pepper, and salt, and roast that off. I take a Kaiser roll and toast it. I open the bottle of wine because you can't watch  The Bachelor  with your roommate and not drink wine. 7:15 p.m. \u2014 I feed the dog, add non-sauced chicken to his food, and then assemble my dinner.

I cook rice on the stove and chop celery, carrots, cherry tomatoes, and sugar snap peas. Then I call out to R. to get my gym bag together, and we head off to gym.

I have $2 with me and I try to give it to him, but he says I should keep it so he doesn't have to settle my coffee debt later. (Sometimes when I have no cash, I get Old Man Curmudgeon to give me my morning coffee on a loan and then have R. pay him back the next morning.) Back at my desk, I have leftover chicken fried rice with salsa and seltzer water and read a short story on  The New Yorker  website. 2 p.m. \u2014Sephora emails me a discount code and I place an order for skincare products. Sometimes I wait too long to reorder my items because I want a code, and then I run out of them and create panic situations.

I buy my facial sunscreen, face wash, cleansing and exfoliating wipes (so great for a lazy nighttime person like me), and decide to try Kat Von D's tattoo liner.

Two generations ago this would be unthinkable.  $92.01 Advertisement 5:30 p.m. \u2014 At home, I drink a glass of wine while making gemelli with spicy Italian sausage, spinach, and cherry tomatoes. R. found this recipe in  Food & Wine  and it's one of our go-tos for weekday dinners and summertime picnic lunches. Incredibly easy and delicious. I cook the sausage in simmering olive oil with onions and red chili flakes. I chop up the spinach and quarter the cherry tomatoes, which I keep in a bowl to toss with the sausage when we come back from the gym. I also throw another pork chop in the oven for R.'s lunch tomorrow. Hang out with R. on the couch, and then it's gym time! 10:30 p.m. \u2014 I read P.G. Wodehouse and turn off the lights.

We have one drink each. R. pays with his credit card ($22 with tip) and we head back to the apartment. Thursday night is our weekly dinner with my cousin who lives in the neighborhood. We have meatballs (from the leftover sausage meat) with gravy and a kitchen sink salad. My cousin walks in with a bottle of wine as I am preparing the gravy (pork stock from the last time we made pork roast, flour, salt, pepper, garlic, and onion powder).

My company is the food and beverage provider for a few major sports teams, and today is my first game day! I get ready and head downstairs to make my coffee, and see that it is snowing AGAIN. I have lived in Oregon for a month and a half, and we've already had four snow days! Coming from California, that's a big deal. I chug my coffee and head to the car, correctly predicting that my commute will be worse than usual. 10:05 a.m. \u2014 I get to work a little late, which is impressive considering the amount of traffic there was on the freeway. Because today is a game day, I have to park further away. After walking in the wrong direction, I finally make it to the employee entrance. I make it into my temporary office and begin processing all of the new hires that came to our orientation yesterday. 12 p.m. \u2014 Lunchtime! There are so many perks about my job (seriously, I have not stopped talking about how amazing my job is since I started), but one of my favorites is that while I'm at this location, I get free food! The culinary team is great and makes food for all our employees, and I load up my plate with a burrito, potatoes, corn salad, and braised chicken. Inputting new hire information is a lot more fun when free food is involved! Advertisement 3:30 p.m. \u2014 It's finally time for the employees to come check in and get their assignments for the game, and I'm so excited! We finish with just enough time for me to run back into my office and grab my stuff for the game. My boyfriend got free tickets from a friend, and my boss is setting us up with a free meal. Needless to say, I'm pretty psyched. 5:45 p.m. \u2014 Dinnertime! My boyfriend brings his friend, and we all enjoy amazing food and great drinks from a local brewery. We tip $20, partly because my company paid for the rest of the meal, and partly because I know these servers rely on great tips from their customers! My boyfriend pays. 10 p.m. \u2014 Finally home! The game was great, and the drive home was better than expected. The employee parking lot isn't super convenient to get to, but it sure makes avoiding post-game traffic easy. I go through my nighttime routine of cleansing with micellar water and putting on moisturizer. I recently got really into my skincare, but my routine is pretty low-key and basic.

I'm heading to my main office to pick up supplies and my administrative assistant. I stop for gas on the way and fill up my tank so I'm not stranded in Portland with no gas. I intend to run into Starbucks and grab drinks and breakfast for the both of us, but in the stress of loading up my tiny car in the rain, I forget. Oh well, tomorrow's a brand new day!  $19.76 Advertisement 11 a.m. \u2014 We make it to the university where we're hosting our hiring event. We'd normally hold it in our offices, but they are under construction, and we don't have space to hold that many people at the moment. We set up much quicker than anticipated, and enjoy chatting with our HR team from the other office. 12 p.m. \u2014 Lunchtime! My boss runs out to grab everyone lunches from a cafe nearby. My rice bowl with avocado, cheese, olives, tomatoes, and sour cream isn't the most satisfying, but it does hold me over through the event! 7 p.m. \u2014 Finally home for five minutes. Tonight my boyfriend and I are attending the last of the six-week communication course we have been taking at our local Chabad house. I have just enough time before the class to run home to grab a package my mom sent. I open it and am so excited to find all sorts of goodies from California! On Purim, one of the things people do is give baskets or bags of goodies to people, and I'm so happy to have this special gift on my first real Purim away from home. We quickly head over to the rabbi's, where we attend our class (he does a special reading for the two of us) and eat homemade hamentaschen. Purim is one of my favorite Jewish holidays. We celebrate Queen Esther, who stood up to the King on behalf of the Jewish people and saved the Jews from Haman (boo!), who had plotted to kill all the Jews because he had major ego issues. Advertisement 9:45 p.m. \u2014 On our way back from the rabbi's, I remember that I haven't eaten real food since noon, and have a sudden craving for a sandwich.

Since I started using the Solution about a month ago, I have noticed such a big difference in the my overall skin. I drink a coffee while scrolling through social media before I have to head out. This is my first day going in at my new time, and I'm pleasantly surprised when my GPS is wrong and I get in 15 minutes earlier than expected. 12:30 p.m. \u2014 I am starving after not eating any breakfast, but manage to make it until my admin assistant's lunch break so we can head over to Fred Meyer together. I recently discovered this behemoth of a grocery store, and I am OBSESSED. I grab really good sushi from the sushi bar and a little triangle of brie (the best grocery store combo I've ever purchased). I get crackers once I'm back in the office, and eat while reading over the bunch of emails that came in while I was out.  $13.79 Advertisement 3:30 p.m. \u2014 And I'm off! After a fun hour of rearranging office furniture, I sneak out early to head to a Purim party. I accidentally leave my admin assistant's keys on my desk. (I am using hers while mine are being made, because I come in so much earlier than her.) I'll have to come in later tomorrow so that someone else can let me in, which bums me out because I was so excited to stick to an early schedule. Oh well.

Then it's back to work setting up my office and getting stuff done. Except I decide I absolutely need to order a three-pack of Glossier's Balm Dotcom. I love the flavor I already have. Now I'll have one in my office, one in my car, and two in my bag! I choose Birthday, Mint, and Cherry for my trio, and pray that they ship soon so that my fingers and lips stop peeling from the cold!  $30 Advertisement 11:45 a.m. \u2014 I'm way too hungry to get any more work done, and venture out into the cold to try a food truck outside my office.

I crawl right into bed and lie down for as long as humanly possible before putting my shoes back on and heading out the door. 10:30 p.m. \u2014 My boyfriend and I try to go to Shabbat dinner every Friday at the rabbi's house, and this will be the last one for a couple weeks because the rabbi is going to Israel! We're all very excited about the group going, and dinner is so much fun. We eat tons of delicious food, and I spend the second half of dinner playing with their two-year-old.

I leave with instructions to call a body shop on Monday and a warning to call a tow truck if any fluid leaks out. I proceed to freak out and refuse to drive my car for the rest of the day, even though I've driven to Portland and back for three days since I noticed the part and clearly have survived. Advertisement 11:45 a.m. \u2014 My boyfriend decides to be productive and take us to Safeway so I can pick up coffee pods for my office. I get frustrated with the selection (why spend $10 on 10 capsules when I can go to Costco and spend $25 on 60?!). We pick up a butternut squash and bread so I can roast the veggies we already have in the fridge and round the mixture out with something new. (My boyfriend pays.) We also stop at a Russian store so my boyfriend can pick up a cake for an International Student Dinner we have tonight. (Boyfriend pays.) Then we head to Costco, and I somehow manage to go through all the aisles and only stop for a few samples. I grab coffee pods, a peanut butter trail mix we're obsessed with, and Tillamook snacking cheese ($53.57). While I pay, my boyfriend gets us two hot dogs.

I love my boyfriend's postgrad program, but deep down, I'm an introvert who hates meeting new people. In the end, I'm glad I went \u2013 it's really cool that the school puts on this potluck dinner every year to celebrate the different countries their students come from. Everyone brought a dish (or dishes) from their home country or culture. We eat until it is physically impossible to eat any more, and somehow get coerced into going out and getting drinks afterwards. Advertisement 9 p.m. \u2014 The only reason I agreed to go out is because we're going to go to this bar that makes the BEST gin and tonic I have ever had. The bar is packed, so we head over to another cool bar that has really good drinks. I'm still hopeful, and order a gin and tonic while my boyfriend orders a Moscow Mule. I end up being seriously disappointed and also way too full to drink my drink quickly. My boyfriend teaches me how to play shuffleboard in the meantime, and I (surprisingly) don't suck!

I do 45 minutes on the bike and 15 minutes on the adaptive motion trainer, too. I'm really trying to get in the habit of working out five days a week. The biggest struggle is just motivating myself to get there.

I've been bugging my boyfriend for months to try using Harry's. Last night, in his sleep, he told me he wanted it, so I figure it's finally time to bite the bullet and buy the thing. As soon as I get in the car, my boyfriend calls me and tells me his phone broke. I head across the street to Best Buy and buy him a phone case using a gift card of his that I've been holding on to.

It's a little burnt, but I'm weirdly into it. I'm a big snacker. 12 p.m. \u2014 Time for lunch! I have leftover rice and beans that definitely need more salt. I almost always use my lunch breaks to read. I preordered Michelle McNamara's book  I'll Be Gone in the Dark  about a month ago, and it arrived yesterday! I settle in to read and eat. 2 p.m. \u2014 My car has been yelling at me that \"oil maintenance is required soon,\" so I hop over to the mechanic shop, which is close to work. The guys who work there are super nice. (And VERY hot! Like all of them. Is it a prerequisite for working there?) While I wait for them to finish, I read more of  I'll Be Gone . I take a break to scroll Facebook and see in one of my local dog groups that someone is looking to trade a medium-sized dog crate for a large dog crate. When I adopted my dog last year, I didn't know what I was doing, and got her an extra-large crate. (She's 50 pounds.) I message the guy and he gets right back to me. We arrange to meet and trade the next day.  $57.99 3 p.m. \u2014 Finally back in the office, but it's a slow day. I eat two Halo mandarins and read Money Diaries. Before I leave work, I check my personal email and see I got an email from my volunteer coordinator at the local animal shelter, where I volunteer about once a week. She emailed to let me know one of my favorite pups, who had been with us for over six months, was adopted by a nice family with kids (and he loves kids!). Happy tears!!! Advertisement 4:30 p.m. \u2014 I leave work and head to Costco. My boyfriend just got us a membership and it's the tits. I like to go once a month to get some staples and one or two snacks; my boyfriend and I eat pretty differently so we mostly buy food separately. This time I pick up sweet potatoes, organic bananas, six boxes of a sweet potato-tomato soup we both like, pasta, a huge jug of peanut butter pretzels (my kryptonite), organic peanut butter, frozen mango, and frozen broccoli. My boyfriend doesn't like peanut butter, but my dog and I do!  $81.66 4:30 p.m. \u2014 I also pick up a jug of laundry detergent and a 36-pack of Fancy Feast for my fancy little panther.  $29.28 5:15 p.m. \u2014 On my way out of Costco, I stop to fill up my car with gas. Since I drive a Prius and only work about three miles from home, I generally only have to fill up my tank once a month, which is awesome. On the way home, I cry a little more thinking about the adopted dog. I am so happy for him, but wish I had gotten a chance to say goodbye.  $20.28 6:15 p.m. \u2014 I'm finally home! I kiss all my babies hello and unpack the groceries. I rearrange and clean the refrigerator and pantry, which is a weird thing I love to do every few weeks. It's so freakin' satisfying to have an organized fridge and pantry. I clean up a bit and do dishes. Advertisement 7 p.m. \u2014 Finally time to start dinner! Every Wednesday my friend comes over for dinner and we watch a true crime-ish show while debating with my boyfriend. (He's a lawyer. We're not, but we like to pretend we know things). We've watched maybe seven shows together so far, and this week we are starting a new one:  Manhunt: Unabomber.  It's my week to make dinner, so I make pasta and broccoli with spicy peanut butter sauce, which is my specialty and my friend's favorite meal of mine. My BF, the peanut butter-hater, makes a separate meal. We sit down to pasta, wine, and the  Unabomber . 10 p.m. \u2014 My friend leaves, and I indulge in Girl Scout cookies that my BF got us. (Apparently I'm \"basic\" for liking Thin Mints. Uh ok, Mr. Shortbread Cookie.) Then I wash my face, apply rosehip oil, brush my teeth, and hit the hay. Daily Total: $294.56", "day_two": "Day Two: 6:30 a.m. \u2014 I'm awake! I get ready while catching up on the minisodes from  My Favorite Murder . Before I leave, I clean the cat's litter box and remind him to be a good boy. He never is but I love him anyway. I make a mango, banana, orange, chia, and coconut milk smoothie and coffee with coconut milk and pack it all up for work. 7:45 a.m. \u2014 I get to work and see my BF has Venmoed me his portion of the rent. After I transfer the amount to my bank account, I pay our rent. Then I start brainstorming for a new project I was assigned. Advertisement 10 a.m. \u2014 I have the entire  Book of Mormon  soundtrack stuck in my head and pause work to snack on peanut butter pretzels. My BF texts about a possible trip to Salt Lake City around my birthday. He's going for work, so we have a free place to stay, and all I would have to buy is the plane ticket. Yes, please. 12 p.m. \u2014 I get out of a meeting and am ready for lunch. I have leftover peanut butter pasta and work through lunch because I want to use my lunch break to run errands. 1 p.m. \u2014 I quickly head over to Petco for pet supplies. I have a membership card there and the rewards and perks are great. Today my dog's wet food is buy one can, get the other half off. I grab about a million of those and two bags of cat litter, which is also on sale.  $41.36 1:45 p.m. \u2014 Settle in for an afternoon of research to the dulcet tunes of Britney Spears. 3:30 p.m. \u2014 Pause for a chilled apple and another handful of pretzels. They're just so goooood. 4:30 p.m. \u2014 I head home. When I get there, I find my BF has already walked the dog. I pout a little because I usually get to walk her after work every day and I enjoy it! I strap her leash back on for a short run so we can get out together. My dog was heartworm positive when I adopted her about a year ago and still hasn't been cleared by our vet. I put her on slow kill treatment right when I got her, and now I get her re-tested every six months. Our vet told me slow kill can take up to two years to be effective. Gulp. Until she's cleared, only mild-to-moderate exercise is allowed, so we don't run often and never run for long. When we get home from our half mile jog I do YouTube exercise videos and the cat joins in (a.k.a. he trips me). I also write in my journal. Advertisement 5:45 p.m. \u2014 Internet kennel man gets here! We are mutually satisfied with our swap and I clean the kennel he gave me. He seemed like a nice responsible young man, but I'm paranoid about fleas. My cat and dog inspect and sniff the new kennel VERY closely. They're a regular bomb squad over here. ( Unabomber  got to me I guess.) I take a shower, wash my face, and apply rosehip oil. This oil is the BOMB (there I go again). My face was very acne-scarred and a little splotchy, and now I feel like an airbrushed IG model. 6:30 p.m. \u2014 I make dinner: pasta and spinach with a spicy sweet potato sauce. It's delicious! I watch  The Office  while I eat. 7:30 p.m. \u2014 Curl up in bed with  Harry Potter  until a scheduled call with my friend. I reread the  HP  series every year and am on  Prisoner of Azkaban . I'm obsessed (and a Ravenclaw). 9 p.m. \u2014 I'm off the phone with my friend. She had work drama to discuss, and then we talked about my trip to visit her and her boyfriend (my other best friend from undergrad) in Philadelphia next week! I'm also going to see her this weekend, since we will randomly both be back in our hometown. I read  HP  until I start dozing off, then go to sleep.

Sometimes the app and I disagree, however, so I snooze a little more when it goes off at 5:40. Advertisement 6 a.m. \u2014 I'm up! I feed the animals and do a Yoga with Adriene video. I absolutely love her energy, and I always have a good day when I start it with one of her videos! 6:30 a.m. \u2014 Adriene was not playing today, so I take another shower before I get ready for work. I am finally caught up on  My Favorite Murde r,  so I listen to an episode of  Zealot . I pack coffee, lunch, and breakfast. 7:30 a.m. \u2014 At work, I drink my coffee and cranberry juice and eat my breakfast of instant oatmeal with coconut oil and coconut flakes. I'm a real coco-head. 10 a.m. \u2014 I have a meeting, so I scarf down leftover stale popcorn so I don't get hungry during it. Yes, I'm that coworker who complains about being hungry during every meeting: you're welcome. 12 p.m. \u2014 Lunchtime! I have leftover pasta with sweet potato sauce and read more  I'll Be Gone . My favorite podcast ( Casefile ) recently did a five-part series on the East Area Rapist/Original Nightstalker, so I already know a lot about the case. However, I appreciate McNamara's thorough research and am enjoying the book overall. I'm looking forward to any possible speculations she may have about the identity of this creep. 2 p.m. \u2014 It's an afternoon of Internet research and catching up on the news. I eat peanut butter pretzels and a banana. My friend texts me about going to a  The Office -themed trivia in a few weeks. We love trivia and  The Office , so I am obviously down and make a note in my calendar. We decide our team will be \"The Bushiest Beavers.\" Advertisement 4 p.m. \u2014 I leave work and head to the library, which is right down the street from work. I FINALLY got a library card because my New Years Resolution was to read 50 books this year. I love our library and have put several books on hold. I pick up two:  Whoever Fights Monsters  (fine, you caught me...I love true crime) and  The Spirit Catches You and You Fall Down . My library card has encouraged me to try a lot of books I probably would not have otherwise bought, and I've read quite a few good ones so far this year! 4:20 p.m. \u2014 Home and time to take the dog on a walk! We do our usual circle but take a few detours so she can sniff new things. We also practice the command \"drop it,\" which she is struggling with, to put it mildly. 4:45 p.m. \u2014 I do dishes and pack for my weekend trip. I read a little bit of  I'll Be Gone  (I want to finish soon so I can get started on my growing stack of library books!) before making dinner. I heat up some of the sweet potato soup I bought and add some of the sweet potato sauce I made to it. It's a sweet potato bonanza. I eat it with bread and olive oil and watch  The Office . I gotta study up if I want to cream some nerds in a few weeks. 6:15 p.m. \u2014 My BF is home with a mattress topper for our bed. We recently bought a king-sized memory foam bed that sleeps pretty warm, so we got a mattress topper that has some kind of cooling gel in it. We tested it out and it worked fantastically, so we bit the bullet and bought one ourselves. I pay him back for half.  $102 Advertisement 6:50 p.m. \u2014 I leave to head to my friend's house to share a drink before heading to a show ( The Glass Menagerie)  at our local community theater. Going to live theater shows is my absolute favorite thing to do. Since my friend and I go to every show at our local theater, I am considering buying myself a season ticket pass to save money in the long run. We'll see. My friend bought us tickets a few days ago, so I pay him back now.  $13 8 p.m. \u2014 I get a glass of red wine at the theater to enjoy during the show.  $6 10:45 \u2014 Wow, what a stunning production. The entire show was fantastic. I say goodbye to my friend at his house and head home. I have a packet of ramen before brushing my teeth and going to bed.

We chat with my boyfriend and I say goodbye to him and my precious pets and remind my BF a million times to clean the litter box. We chat and listen to horror movie podcasts in the car, and I read a little of my book. 11:30 a.m. \u2014 We arrive at my parents' house but no one is there, so my brother and I decide to get lunch at a sushi burrito place in the meantime. I stuff mine with tofu, cucumbers, seaweed, and spicy mayo.  $10.70 Advertisement 2:30 p.m. \u2014 We head to our grandmother's condo to visit. It really is a nice surprise that both she and my other grandmother are visiting from out of town on the same weekend. My aunt is also over, so we spend time together catching up on family drama and arguing about who would be most valuable on  Family Feud.  (It would obviously be me.) I drink a Bud Lite that I found in the fridge. 4:45 p.m. \u2014 When we get back to my parent's house, we spend time catching up with the other grandma. For dinner, my brother wants to try a new Korean place, and we all agree that sounds good. 5:45 p.m. \u2014 We get to the restaurant and are seated immediately. My brother spends way too much time talking about his recent vacation to Japan, and I order a soft tofu vegetable soup called sundubu-jjigae and a Kirin. The soup is absolutely delicious, and I make a mental note to look up a recipe to see if I can recreate it at home. My grandmother grabs the bill from my brother, so the meal is free. 7:15 p.m. \u2014 My mom and I take her stinky Boston Terrier mix on a walk and gossip. I love catching up with her, and after going to undergrad almost five hours away, it's nice that I live a little closer now. When we get home, we watch  Big Daddy  with my grandma until my sister gets home. 9:30 p.m. \u2014 My sister shows up LITERALLY dressed like the women from the \"Women and Women First\" skit on Portlandia, and is very mad at me for teasing her about it. She tells me all about the event she was volunteering at. I'm getting tired, so I ask her to drive me back to our other grandmother's condo, where my brother and I are staying the night. He's off hanging out with a friend from high school and won't be back until late. I sweeten the deal by offering to buy her a McFlurry, and she accepts.  $3.20 Advertisement 11:15 p.m. \u2014 My grandma and I watch  Family Feud  before I turn in for the night.

I rifle through my grandma's fridge looking for breakfast, and settle on a bagel with cream cheese before getting ready for the day. 9:30 a.m. \u2014 My brother and I leave to head to my parent's house. My mom is making mozzarella sticks, and I have a few. 10 a.m. \u2014 My friend (the one I caught up with on the phone) comes over, bearing gifts! Whenever she orders makeup and doesn't like it, she saves it to bring over for us. When we saw her at Christmas, my mom mentioned wanting a certain ColourPop eyeshadow pallet, and it turns out my friend got it as a free gift with a recent order, so she gives it to my mom. My mom screams with excitement and immediately starts rubbing the shadow all over her hand. My friend also hands over a book she recently finished and wants me to read. It is called  The Door  by Magda Szabo. This TBR pile is real, y'all. 12:30 p.m. \u2014 My friend leaves, and we have lunch. My mom has made an excellent spread and I chow down on vegetarian chili, a green salad, cheesy bread, and corn chowder. I wish I lived in this house still, where the corn chowder flows freely. Advertisement 1:45 p.m. \u2014 Time to head back to Tallahassee! My mom sends us off with a cantaloupe each, for which I am grateful. I will take all of the free food, please. We say bye and get on the highway. I read more of my book and nap. 3 p.m. \u2014 We stop to get gas and both decide we want a soda as well. While I am near the soda fountain, an employee accidentally drops all the soda lids, and I help her pick them up. I guess her manager saw me, because when I try to check out with my soda, they give it to me for free! How nice of them! I give my brother a little money for gas.  $5.50 4:30 p.m. \u2014 We're home! When we roll into my apartment parking lot we see my boyfriend out walking our dog, who is so excited to see me she practically drags my BF over to the car. My brother comes upstairs with us to say hi to my cat and then heads back to his house. My BF and I assess our food situation and decide to pick up a few things at Publix. I get BOGO coffee, salsa, and deli slices, as well as Tostitos, chickpeas, and split peas. I also get dry cat food ($6.39). When we get home, we unpack and make dinner. I make pasta with marinara sauce and split peas. It's filling but not very satisfying, so I also have a Girl Scout cookie.  $27.48 Advertisement 7 p.m. \u2014 I go over to my friend's house to hang out, and bring chips and salsa.

Daily Total: $32.98", "day_six": "Day Six: 6:45 a.m. \u2014 My alarm goes off. I got a terrible night's sleep and woke up almost every hour. My BF and I snuggle a bit before I drag myself out of bed. I feed the animals, clean the litter box, and get ready for work while listening to  Horror Movie Podcast  and chugging coffee. I make an egg sandwich and head to work. 8 a.m. \u2014 I am at work and extremely sleepy. I eat my sandwich and drink more coffee. Once the coffee kicks in I get down to work business while listening to more  Horror Movie Podcast.  My brother texts me about our cell phone bill. My portion is cheaper than expected this month because I just switched to a cheaper plan, but I didn't expect the savings to kick in so soon. I Venmo him my share of the bill and put the excess of what I had set aside in savings. 11 a.m. \u2014 I pause for a cup of coffee and peanut butter pretzels. I'm super hungry today. 12 p.m. \u2014 I stop for lunch, which is the last of the peanut butter pasta from last week. It is not so good and makes me feel nauseous. I remember an apple I left in the fridge at work and eat that to tide me over. I am still reading  I'll Be Gone , but see a light at the end of the tunnel! Advertisement 3:45 p.m. \u2014 I've done all I can do, and leave work early with thoughts of taking a nap. I snuggle in bed with my pets, but my cat wouldn't stop kneading my hair and my dog insists on lying right on my bladder, so I kick them out. After that, they whine and meow outside the door, so I never end up falling asleep. I'm very frustrated and on the verge of an anxiety meltdown by the time my BF gets home. 5 p.m. \u2014 I take the dog on a walk to try to clear my head, but she must be sensing my anxiety, because she's acting up. I cut the walk short and ask my BF to take our dog back out so she can get her exercise. I lay back down, do some deep breathing exercises, and remind myself I will get a good night's sleep tonight, so there's no need to feel this anxious. It helps a little bit. It helps even more when my BF gets back and offers to order us Chinese food. 6:15 p.m. \u2014 The food gets here. I ordered Szechuan tofu, a vegetable medley, and fried rice. We load up our plates and sit down in front of this week's  John Oliver . The segment tonight is on the NRA, which is a group all too familiar to us Floridians. After Johnny O., we snuggle on the couch and watch an episode of  The Office , some funny YouTube videos, and the beginning of a Katt Williams stand-up special on Netflix. Advertisement 8 p.m. \u2014 I climb into bed and read  I'll Be Gone  for a few chapters before switching to  Harry Potter . I finish  Prisoner of Azkaban  and consider moving on to  Goblet of Fire , but remember I need an extra good night's sleep tonight. I make a cup of Pukka Night Time tea (THE BEST tea for falling asleep!) and am out by 9.

I snuggle with my honey for a few minutes and then get up to feed the pets. I put on my exercise clothes and stretch for a few minutes before doing about twenty minutes of butt and leg exercises. Afterwards, I shower and do my makeup while listening to  This Is Actually Happening. 7:30 a.m. \u2014 I want today to be extra nice after yesterday's exhaustion fest, so I pull out my French press for my morning coffee. I also make a mango, banana, chia seed, and coconut milk smoothie for breakfast and a sandwich with Field Roast deli slices, spicy pickles, spinach, spicy mustard, and mayo for lunch. I pack everything up and leave for work. 8 a.m. \u2014 At work I catch up on the news while drinking my smoothie and coffee. I also check my bank account to make sure all of my Venmos have gone through. I work more on a survey I began yesterday while listening to showtunes, taking breaks to eat peanut butter pretzels when necessary. 11:50 a.m. \u2014 The pretzels aren't cutting it anymore, so I break for lunch. I have my sandwich with chips and salsa and a big glass of water while reading my book. When I'm done eating I take a little extra time to write in my journal and process some thoughts I had over the weekend. MyBF also texts me to make him a haircut appointment. His barber shop only takes appointments through an app, and that app only works on my phone! He is very particular about his hair and his barber, though, so I double-check all of the details he gives me before making the appointment for him. 1 p.m. \u2014 I make a cup of green tea to ward off the after-lunch sleepies and get back to work on my survey. 4:30 p.m. \u2014 After a pretty uneventful but productive afternoon, I head home. I feed my pets and when they're done eating, I pick my cat up like a baby and tickle his tummy. He's been acting extra naughty lately and I make a mental note to play with him more, because I think he just wants attention. I clip on my dog's leash and load up the new season of  Somebody Knows Something . We take an extra long walk while I figure out what, exactly, somebody knows. 5:30 p.m. \u2014 When we get home, I take a shower so my hair can dry before bed. I find it looks best when I do this. I consider doing a face mask, but my face feels a little irritated so I just rub on my rosehip oil. I am fairly low maintenance with my skincare routine and only use all-natural products. I wash with honey and moisturize with the oil, and will usually exfoliate a few times a week with a blend of coffee grounds and coconut oil. However, my mom got me a SheaMoisture exfoliating scrub that I've been using recently, and I think that's what's making my skin irritated, so I'll probably stop using it. After my shower, I fold and put away laundry that I managed to wash yesterday, empty the dishwasher, and wipe down my kitchen counters. 6:30 p.m. \u2014 My brother is over for a scary movie! I heat up leftover Chinese food, grab us beers, and we settle into to watch  Veronica . It was very hyped online and while it was scary, and I love supernatural/possession horror, it wasn't \"the scariest movie of all time.\" 8:15 p.m. \u2014 My brother leaves and I watch and episode of  The Office  to unwind while cuddling with my cat. He drools when he purrs, which is simultaneously gross and very adorable. 8:45 p.m. \u2014 After my episode is over, I pull my boyfriend away from his video game to spend time with me in the bedroom. We take a quick shower afterwards and cuddle a bit before lights out. Daily Total: $0", "url": "https://www.refinery29.com/money-diary-tallahassee-fl-policy-analyst-salary"},

This was one of the main reasons we wanted to move to the suburbs \u2013 for the space! I pack Greek yogurt with almond butter, honey, and granola for my breakfast, ground chicken lettuce cups for lunch, and a can of lime seltzer water. Then I do my face routine: wash with plain raw honey, spritz with Caudalie Water to calm my rosacea cheeks, rub a drop of The Ordinary Hyaluronic Acid on my forehead, dab on a little Belif eye cream, layer Cetaphil SPF 30 sunscreen on top, and then apply a few dots of Glossier Perfecting Skin Tint on my cheeks, too, because of the rosacea redness. My boyfriend and I carpool into the city together at 7:45. I drop him off at the train and get to work by 8:20. 12 p.m. \u2014 I always use my lunch break to take a walk, even in the cold. I really need to stretch my legs and get as far away from my office as possible. Today I call my little sister and we have a nice chat. She and I are going to Myrtle Beach for a long weekend this month. My mom is letting us use her timeshare points, so the resort is free for us. Another friend is joining and agreed to drive, so I'm splitting the cost of gas and tolls with her. When I get back from my walk, I microwave my ground chicken stir-fry in the microwave and spoon it into the lettuce cups I brought \u2013 so tasty and satisfying. Most of my coworkers take their lunch breaks around this time, so the office is nearly empty while I eat at my desk.

We have to stop at Autozone to get a new bulb for my headlight, since we noticed it burned out the day before. I also get gas while we're out because I'm a nervous person and don't like driving with less than a quarter tank. I drive a little baby Nissan, so it's only $22 to fill it up.  $33 6:15 p.m. \u2014 After I drop off the BF at home and change into exercise clothes, I drive to the gym. We have only been in Wilmington about six months, and I'm still getting used to having to drive EVERYWHERE. It takes 15 to 20 minutes to get to the gym from our house. I want to stay for an hour to make the drive worth it, so I do 30 minutes on the elliptical, 25-ish minutes of weights (arms today), a one-minute plank, and then run as fast as I can (not very fast at all in comparison to most people \u2013 ha) for five minutes. I hate running! That's why it's last! 7:45 p.m. \u2014 BF makes chicken thighs with roasted red potatoes and carrots for dinner. We bought meal stuff over the weekend to last us the whole week.

Oops! I grab a thinkThin bar for breakfast. It's nearing the first of the month, so I send out my mortgage and trash checks. The taxes in Wilmington are super cheap (which is one of the reasons I like living here), but you end up having to pay for a lot of things yourself, like monthly trash removal. 12 p.m. \u2014 I take my usual walk for about 45 minutes before returning to the office and eating more of the ground chicken and lettuce cups that I prepped Sunday. 3 p.m. \u2014 I am a creature of habit, so 3 p.m. is typically when I need a pick-me-up. I have my Suja Uber Greens juice and a banana that I brought. This day is DRAGGING. 6 p.m. \u2014 BF and I stop at PetSmart on the way home, because my angel baby Pearl is low on dog food ($35). I also pick up cheap Milk-Bone teeth cleaning chews for both our dogs ($4.99 for a box of five). Then I make dinner. We have chorizo tacos with all the fixin's.  $34.99 8 p.m. \u2014 I decide to unwind by taking an edible. My BF handles all pot-related transactions, so it's free for me. I get too stoned and eat two humongous bowls of granola with almond milk. I feel so sick and go to bed early, only to wake up at 12:30 a.m. and puke. Awesome.

I'm not ready for real food yet. 5 p.m. \u2014 I leave work and go straight home, even though I usually go to the gym on Wednesdays. I pull the pork out of the Crock-Pot and shred it, then make cilantro rice and guacamole for rice bowls. (We eat a lot of spicy food in our house!) We watch  Oceans Eleven  because there's literally nothing else to watch, and I eat an orange for dessert. (I just canceled Hulu and Sling because I have too many subscriptions and need to save money however I can.) 9 p.m. \u2014 I'm a night shower-er because I like feeling clean when I hit the sheets. Tonight I do a Biore nose strip after my shower, followed by a face mask (Glossier Mega Greens Galaxy Pack). It's just okay. I will probably go back to using Kiehl's when I use this stuff up.

It tastes good and I personally believe it makes me ~glow~ but maybe I'm wrong. Advertisement 12 p.m. \u2014 It's raining, so I can't go for a walk during my break. Instead, I take a nap in the back seat of my car for 45 minutes. When I wake up, I microwave leftover pork and rice from last night. 3 p.m. \u2014 Green tea time! I also brought a hard-boiled egg from home. I don't really like eggs, but people say they're good for you, so I eat it! 5:30 p.m. \u2014 I get home from work and my BF has dinner ready. It's roasted brussels sprouts with bacon, blue cheese, and a balsamic glaze (a recipe from Chrissy Teigen's cookbook). We use her recipes all the damn time. Like, so much that the outside of the book is sticky from ingredients getting all over it. 7:30 p.m. \u2014 We go to the movies to see  Annihilation . We both read the book and were really excited about seeing the film. We have MoviePass, so the tickets don't cost anything. My boyfriend got me a $90 year-long subscription for Christmas. We see movies about once a week, so it's definitely worth it for us. Daily Total: $0", "day_five": "Day Five: 7 a.m. \u2014 I sleep in a little because we were up late.

There's not much around my office other than fast food, and since I didn't bring anything to eat, I just have a couple scoops of my almond butter that I keep in the work fridge. 5:30 p.m. \u2014 I go straight home after work. BF asks what to make for dinner. We both want something easy, so we drive to Food Lion and pick up two cans of Campbell's tomato soup and a head of broccoli. We make the soup with saut\u00e9ed broccoli and roasted red potatoes on the side. Voila. Meatless meal.

I eat leftover pork, black bean hummus with carrots (that have been in the fridge for a while), pickle chips, Greek yogurt with honey and almond butter, and a few pieces of salami. Then I get stoned and watch an old ABC Family movie on Netflix. I'm not known for making good choices! Advertisement 5 p.m. \u2014 We decide to get an early dinner and try out a Mexican restaurant we haven't been to before. I get the shrimp fajitas and my boyfriend pays. Then, we walk to a nearby frozen yogurt place. BF doesn't eat many sweets, so I treat myself to a banana frozen yogurt with coconut, cherries, and whipped cream on top.

(Some people call this \"meditating.\") I get up, take a puff of our vape, and chop up a head of cauliflower to roast in the oven for our lunch. I coat the cauliflower in buffalo sauce for our meatless version of buffalo \"wings\" and put on  To Wong Foo, Thanks For Everything!  on Netflix to make myself feel better. I pop a load of laundry in the washer to feel extra accomplished. Advertisement 2 p.m. \u2014 My movie is over, so I start making a big pot of chili.

I make my bed and begin my usual morning skincare routine, which consists of ice rolling my face (something I have gotten literally ALL of my friends hooked on). It wakes me up and makes me feel like I have Leighton Meester's skin and Blake Lively's body (it's as much mentally therapeutic as it is physically). I apply Clinique Lotion (I swear by this stuff) as well as Fresh Lotus Youth Preserve Face Cream. I am about to go for a run, so I throw on tinted sunscreen. 8 a.m. \u2014 I grab my AirPods and I'm out the door for a short run to my favorite coffee shop. It's nestled in one of the prettiest neighborhoods in Dallas so I get some views with my run. The route I've planned is about four miles and it's tougher than I expected ... maybe no half marathon for me this month.

I can hardly bare to tell her that I don't have any cash with me. I am surprised by her reaction, as she offers me some anyway because I look tired. HA! I politely decline again, but decide that if time allows I'll go home for cash and come back \u2013 kindness like hers should be encouraged.

It has been unseasonably rainy in Dallas this week (which my inner Seattle girl is all about), and I was worried they might have gone inside, but to my great surprise they are still there! I pull over and the little girl recognizes me, rushes over to give me a hug, and introduces me to all of her friends. The group has grown to about 10 girls and I'm seriously considering riding scooters in the street with them until I remember I have about 10 minutes until church starts. I thank them again for their kindness and generosity and say a quick prayer to myself that the the rain holds off for them. Feeling full of joy and happiness, I make it to my spot in the pew with no time to spare.  $10 12:45 p.m. \u2014 I head to Central Market with my mental shopping list in tow. Going to Central Market is one of my favorite parts of my week. My friends and I have a joke that one day I'll meet my husband in the milk aisle. (A girl can dream.)

This is by far one of my most frivolous indulgences, but I can't help it. It takes me back to when I spent a semester in Germany and my host mother would always have fresh flowers from her garden. Instant happiness. I grab three bouquets and decide I'll mix them and make my own at home. I also can't pass up a bag of blood oranges.  $15 2:30 p.m. \u2014 I am literally starving and have purchased enough food to host a small Thanksgiving. I live alone, so it really hits me when I over-purchase, but I bring my lunch to work every day. I heat up jasmine rice I already have in the freezer from TJ's, and cook up broccoli to eat with it. I constantly joke about becoming a vegetarian because I'm too lazy to prepare meat. After my raging hunger is cured, I get to meal prepping. I add taco seasoning I already had to the ground turkey, and mix it with onion and serrano peppers. I also make a stir-fry with chicken, egg, onion, serrano, and teriyaki.

I'm a member here (so our tickets are free) and have seen the exhibit several times, but it's my friend's first time seeing it and she is in awe. We swing by some works that feel like old friends: a couple Monets, Picassos, and Pollocks.

It's with a guy, R., who I've been seeing, but with both of our busy schedules, we don't get to see each other too much. He tells me it's my turn to pick. I choose a new French restaurant I know he'll love. I've only been for drinks, so I'm excited to see how the food compares. 7:30 p.m. \u2014 He picks me up at 7:30. I called ahead to get a reservation, but the earliest one was 9:30, so we just sit at the bar (which is honestly better for people-watching anyway). The sommelier talks us into a Moroccan red and we're feeling kind of adventurous. I get the ricotta gnocchi with prosciutto, and R. gets the duck. It's fun to finally see him after such a hectic week. R. always picks up the tab. (This semi-annoys me, but really it's just his giving and considerate nature, which are two qualities I really like about him.) 10:30 p.m. \u2014 We laugh until we cry and can honestly keep going for hours, but I have a super early morning, so R. drops me off and I embark on my usual nightly routine.

SoulCycle always gets me when I need it most. It may be cultish and excessive and overpriced, but it is also a supportive community. This instructor always closes out his upbeat classes with a slower song and gives us a moment to reflect on why we're here and why we're making the effort to better ourselves. His words this morning hit me just where I need them.  $30 Advertisement 7 a.m. \u2014 It's a refrigerator omelet morning because: 1. I have time, and 2. I have way too much uncooked food in my fridge. Eggs, onions, green onions, asparagus, spinach, garlic, and serranos later, and I'm thinking I should probably audition for  Top Chef . 8:15 a.m. \u2014 At my desk, I sip coffee from the office kitchen. It's Friday and someone brought donuts (cue angels singing). 8:30 a.m. \u2014 Another surprise pitch comes in and the day goes by super fast. I munch on whatever I can get my hands on throughout the day, knowing I'll have a big dinner. 7 p.m. \u2014 I rush home, shower, and get ready because I'm late for dinner with friends. I haven't seen these girls since we all went on vacation in January, so I'm pretty pumped to (nearly) all be back in one place. 10 p.m. \u2014 We try a new sister restaurant to one that we already love, and it lives up to the hype. The drinks and food are great and my friend pays for us to Uber five blocks to a bar (yes...but in our defense, it was raining and we were in heels). The door guy at the bar knows us and greets us with a hug. We see so many people we know, it feels like college. For a big city, Dallas is so unbelievably small. We contemplate going somewhere else, but decide to order pizza and call it a night. I Venmo my friend for the pizza, and Uber the two miles home ($8.50).  $60 Advertisement Daily Total: $90", "day_seven": "Day Seven: 6:30 a.m. \u2014 The Arboretum here in Dallas does a members-only early access from 7 a.m. to 9 a.m. The tulip exhibit has just begun and I am so excited to go without there being wild children there, so I set my alarm to make it happen. 6:50 a.m. \u2014 I'm up and out the door, book and yoga mat in tow. I head to my favorite coffee shop to grab a coffee \u2013 it's about 65 and sunny (the holy grail of Dallas weather). I order a small skinny vanilla latte and get a box of organic raspberries. Call my mom and dad and then my grandparents on my way, the only five people I know up at this hour. My parents live pretty close and we talk every day, but one of my grandmas lives in another state and my other grandma and papa live several hours away, so our morning calls are one of my favorite parts of the day.  $12 7:20 a.m. \u2014 I get to the Arboretum, and since I'm a member, admission and parking are free. In two hours, this place will be a literal madhouse. I throw out my yoga mat in my favorite spot overlooking the lake and do a couple quick salutations to get in the right headspace. I do self-reflecting on 2018 thus far and am thankful I made this time for myself. This moment brings me back to when I went on a solo trip to Seattle for my 25th birthday, and I'm reminded how much moments of independence mean to me in a world where solitude is so often regarded as loneliness. It's taken me a long time to get to this point, but I can't help but smile at how far I've come. Advertisement 9:30 a.m. \u2014 I almost forget I'm meeting a couple friends for SoulCycle at 11:45, so I make a quick run to Central Market. I'm heading to Colorado next week, so I grab the weekly essentials. I call my brother and we catch up on each other's weekends. He's jealous I'm going snowboarding, but we throw around dates for a weekend we can take all of our friends to the house this summer. He's only two years younger than me and we went to the same college, so we're very close. He is truly the most hilarious, intelligent, genuine, witty, and effortlessly genuine person I know and I am honestly much cooler because I am his sister. I pray he ends up in Dallas after he finishes graduate school.  $30 10:30 a.m. \u2014 I have about an hour to kill before SoulCycle. I always have my ENO Hammock (Christmas gift from my brother) in my car, so I drive over to my favorite spot to continue my book while laying in my hammock. This has already been the best day, and it's hardly begun! 11:45 a.m. \u2014 Time to cycle! My two friends have never been before, so it's always exciting for me to have a hand in exposing people I care about to something that has given me so much in the last year. One friend opts for earplugs. She's a grandma in a 30-year-old's body and I absolutely love it. She tells me about a supper club she and her husband are in and says I should join next week. I am ecstatic and touched to be included.  $30 Advertisement 1 p.m. \u2014 I am literally famished by the time class ends, so we walk next door to get poke bowls. I cannot pass up spicy tuna with bamboo rice! This place is so absurdly priced, but worth it. I also get a yuzu lemonade. We sit outside and enjoy the heat of the sun on our skin.  $15 1:30 p.m. \u2014 I get a phone call from my friend who I'm meeting for coffee. She wants to go to the coffee shop I went to this morning. It's one of my favorite places in Dallas, so I oblige. This time I try a charcoal latte, because it's new and I can't pass up a trendy over-priced latte. I say bye to my friend and we decide to book Pilates for tomorrow at 2:30. My body is hesitant after SoulCycle, but my brain wins. I'm on ClassPass, so it doesn't cost me anything outside of my monthly fee.  $6 2:30 p.m. \u2014 I go with a friend to see  Call Me by Your Name . She gets the tickets and I get the popcorn and drinks. The movie is incredible: beautifully executed and compositionally alluring. I'm somewhat socially-drained and super tired from my early wake-up call, so ya girl heads home for a nap.   $20 7 p.m. \u2014 I wake up to a million missed calls from several friends. I had hopes of staying in tonight, but it doesn't look like that's going to be received very well. Because I live alone, I'm always touched by the friends who reach out to me. It's so easy to get lost in the shuffle unintentionally, that the added effort motivates me to shower and get ready. Advertisement 8:30 p.m. \u2014 I Uber to meet some friends at the Truck Yard. It's the coolest place \u2013 all outdoor seating with multiple food trucks, which is great for a group of friends that can't decide what to eat. I order two beers and my friend grabs me a hot dog. I take one bite and instantly regret the hot dog, but eat it anyway because I'm so hungry. I finish my beer and head to meet another group of friends.  $25 10 p.m. \u2014 They're just wrapping up dinner, so I sit for a bit and catch up with everyone. The group is comprised of my closest college friends, and my heart might just burst, I'm so happy to be with all of them. We go back to my friend's apartment, drink beer, and then go to the rooftop of a new hotel that just opened. We run into guys we met on a cruise in college (how strange!) and we catch up on what all's been going on. The views are dazzling and I'm taken back in time as we sip gin and tonics.  $15 12 a.m. \u2014 We stop at one more bar. I order a tequila neat, which has been my recent go-to, but the combo of the nights' other drinks has me wishing I opted for water. A couple of us have an early morning, so I ditch the drink (ugh, what a waste) and Uber home ($7.50). I wash my face, add my serums, and chug a glass of water before going to bed.  $20 Advertisement Daily Total: $173", "url": "https://www.refinery29.com/money-diary-dallas-graphic-designer-salary"},

I call an Uber on my dad's American Express \u2013 I'm the only one he's not making car payments for, and he's a freak about safety when it comes to commuting, so he's let me keep his card on my account (I swear I only use it occasionally). It really has helped me out. ($9.11 expensed) 9:35 a.m. \u2014 I always make a pot of coffee before I leave the house, but sometimes I'm honestly too lazy to fill the pot.

I brought tons of fruit, but of course I go downstairs to get honey mustard-and-onion pretzel nubs from the vending machine to sustain me for my two-hour language class at 6.

My house is two miles away from a metro stop, so I'm pretty dependent on rideshares but try to bike most places when it's not winter.  $8.78 Advertisement 9:10 a.m. \u2014 I'm supposed to be in at 9, and my boss is PSYCHOTIC, so I text my coworker to let him know that I'll be a bit late \"because of the bus.\" I inhale sweet potatoes and an avocado while waiting for the bus. 12:15 p.m. \u2014 Unclear if it's because I didn't eat last night or because work has already been heck today, but I am famished. I have a lot of food guilt when I eat unhealthily (a.k.a. wine and M&M's for dinner), so I go buy a Chop't salad, my weakness, and accept that my whole saving money thing is just not going to work out this week.  $11.94 2 p.m. \u2014 There's leftover cookies and coffee at work from a conference, so naturally my coworkers and I rush to the free food. 5:15 p.m. \u2014 Metro to a networking happy hour over by the Hill that I am very underwhelmed for. I meet my friend halfway and we catch up on life, since it's been a while. All the drinks are free (the only reason people go), so we end up having a blast and drinking way too much wine. I pick up a few business cards of new faces and consider it a successful night. 7:30 p.m. \u2014 I'm more than a little tipsy from the wine because I'm a lightweight, and I Uber to FWB's house, despite telling myself I would absolutely not let him become my drunk booty call just yet. (Realistically, though, this was bound to happen.) The train is literally right next to my pick-up and destination, so I scold myself for Ubering once I'm in the car.

He lets me stay in bed until I need to leave for work, so I sleep for another hour before walking to the office. 11:45 a.m. \u2014 I am FAMISHED. I stole some of FWB's crackers this morning, but two days in a row of not eating dinner is really getting to me. I go buy a massive tuna salad wrap and chips in the cafeteria.  $7.09 3 p.m. \u2014 The day has passed terribly slowly, but I'm supposed to go meet an old boss on the Hill for a life catch-up.

We catch up on the walk and then hang out in his office for a few hours after his meeting, drinking beer and talking about life.

I've been out of town for the past two weekends and feel like I've literally had no down time since January. I help my roommate get ready for her date (she's a serial dater, in the nicest way possible), and make small talk with him when he shows up a bit too early. I do a face mask, catch up on  Grey's Anatomy , and fall asleep around midnight full of Trader Joe's edamame, olives, and tortilla chips.

I didn't think we'd see each other this often, but I feel less guilty about it because my best friends all either have family in town or are away this weekend. FWB and I normally hang out together in groups on the weekend anyways, only now it just involves a bit more ... lol.

We go to the store to buy the necessities for a lazy weekend: crescent rolls, Lit'l Smokies, chips, guac, and a huge bottle of wine. I Venmo him for three quarters of it because he always buys our food without asking for me to pay him back, so I definitely owe him more than half.  $15 3:30 p.m. \u2014 Luckily it's just cold enough to not be outdoors, so we feel less guilty for being lazy.

But we barely slept last night, and this morning, daylight savings time hits us hard. Plus we've never had the chance to just do nothing together, and I'm a big fan. We finally motivate ourselves to get up over the course of an hour after really comprehending just how lazy we have been, and make a to-do list to salvage the rest of the day. 2 p.m. \u2014 I need to start bringing lunch to work instead of buying, so I head to Trader Joe's to stock up on lunch food (even though I hate how crowded Sundays always are there). It's my mom's birthday, so I Facetime with her while I walk and make a mental note to send her flowers at work next week. Normally I love going all out on gifts, but my sisters and I spent way more than we could afford for her Christmas gift, so we're kind of giving ourselves a pass this year.

Plus stuff for turkey wraps, as well as kombucha (which I've recently tried to make more of a habit of drinking). I didn't expect to spend this much money, but I bought a bunch of produce, so I'm not that surprised ($52.11).

Everyone's here, which never happens on Mondays, and I can already tell this day is going to be real rough. 10:30 a.m. \u2014 I break open my Goldfish for a mid-morning snack. I've been trying to eat healthier, but this is one thing I cannot shake. I eat way too many fish and already feel the heartburn coming. 12:15 p.m. \u2014 I cram for my final exam during my lunch break and enjoy the peace and quiet of an empty office. My wrap's good, but I definitely regret not bringing more food. The past few weeks I've haven't had much of an appetite due to the stress of work, so I take it as a good sign that I'm still hungry after lunch, and make a mental note to buy more Goldfish at CVS this week. 2:30 p.m. \u2014 I am slowly dying. I am a caffeine addict, but I despise our Keurig coffee, so I usually try to avoid it during the afternoons. I really want to go grab a cappuccino but find an apple in my desk to distract me from spending money. Counting down the hours until tonight's happy hour. 5 p.m. \u2014 I know it's a bad idea to drink before my final, but if you don't know a language when you're drunk, do you really know it? I grab a margarita from my coworker's pitcher and fill up on chips and guac. It's nice to hang out with everyone outside of the office, but also a bit stressful, so I'm not that disappointed when I have to leave. Plus, I really don't need to be marg drunk on a Monday.

It was a BREEZE. Honestly, I could've had an entire pitcher of margs. 7:30 p.m. \u2014 Most of my coworkers are still at happy hour, so I head back to the bar. One of the girls just found out she got passed up for a promotion by an outside hire, and she is distraught, so we plan to move to another bar to drink and vent about how much we hate our jobs. Once we start moving, though, her husband picks her up and we take it as a sign that we should call it a night, seeing as most people are drunk by now anyways. 8:15 p.m. \u2014 FWB and I try to sneak back to his house without our coworkers seeing. It really doesn't help that he lives next to three of them, but we manage to Uber separately and pull it off.  $5.29 8:30 p.m. \u2014 He's pretty drunk, so we chat and drink a little red wine while he fills me in on what I missed at the happy hour while I was taking my test.

I have a granola bar at my desk, but I'm starving and a bit hungover from the wine, so I splurge and buy an omelet from our cafeteria.  $5.95 11 a.m. \u2014 Honestly I'm not even hungry, yet somehow I'm eating Goldfish again. I have the strangest meeting of my life with a colleague, and am brutally reminded of why I have to find a new job soon. Our work environment is toxic. 12:30 p.m. \u2014 I go to lunch but am still not hungry yet, thanks to the omelet. We all share our March Madness bracket picks, and I set a reminder on my phone to finish mine tonight. I don't keep up with college basketball any other time of the year, but I LOVE March Madness. After an hour of avoiding going back to our desks, we finally make moves. Luckily I have a TJ's salad I left in the fridge yesterday, and I scarf it down while going through emails.

I just signed up for a cycling class tonight, though, so I'm telling myself to only have one cup. 4 p.m. \u2014 The meeting was POINTLESS and now I think I'm even more tired than I was before.  I'm really regretting signing up for this class, but the $5 no show charge is motivating me to not bail. 5 p.m. \u2014 Sprint to the bus from work to make it home to get changed before class. I tell myself I'm way more fit than I think I am (which is a lie), and walk to my first spin class. 7 p.m. \u2014 I am dead, literally dead. My legs are jello and what on earth is going on with my butt. My dad does this on the reg and so does my best friend, and now I literally think they are crazy. I strategically sat in the back during class, but the instructor could still see everything. What a day. Hopefully I worked off the wine, though. 7:45 p.m. \u2014 Shower and make a Buddha bowl to continue on Day One of my health streak. I bought frozen carrot spirals from TJ's, and I am obsessed. I should be doing my language homework right now, so I kind of read over my vocab while actually catching up on  Grey's .  Tuesday's are hard. 11 p.m. \u2014 I could've gone to bed HOURS ago, but here I am.

On my way back I stop by the weekly produce market in my neighborhood. It's all \u201cold\u201d stuff from various grocery stores, but it's super cheap. I buy three bell peppers, two avocados, a handful of green beans, strawberries, blackberries, raspberries, and blueberries. I would easily pay triple that at the grocery store, especially for the berries. They sometimes go bad quickly, but I typically freeze the excess to use in smoothies. I also pick up a coffee on my way home.  $14.62 Advertisement 12:45 p.m. \u2014 My friends pick me up and we go for a lunch of fish tacos and tequila. Afterward, we go shopping.

I can't find anything, so I settle on treating her to lunch when she visits tomorrow.  $31.06 6 p.m. \u2014 I'm babysitting tonight \u2014 my fun version of a Saturday night! Living in Boston is expensive, I don't make a lot of money at my job, and I'm starting full-time grad school soon, so every penny counts! Plus this baby is an absolute cutie and the parents are great. I put the baby to bed and start a book \u2013  A Widow for One Year  by John Irving. It was on sale for $7 at my local bookstore. The parents offer to give me $20 to order in food, but that feels a little too generous to me, so I snack on an RXBar I brought from home and peruse their fridge. I settle on veggies dipped in hummus. They get home around midnight and insist on calling me an Uber home. They Venmo me $100 for the night. I usually keep most of my babysitting money in Venmo and use it to pay my roommate for my half of the utility bills each month.

Before we leave, I put two trash bags' worth of old clothes in my mom's car for her to drop off at a donation bin. I couldn't find any place within walking distance of my apartment, so my mom is kindly doing it for me. My sister and I treat our mom to brunch at one of our favorite spots. Then we go shopping and take a nice long walk back to my mom's car, stopping for gelato at Eataly on the way!  $56.12 6 p.m. \u2014 I get home and relax for a bit. I try to stay caught up with the news and this year for Christmas, my dad gifted me a yearlong subscription to  The New York Times . I read the news for a bit until it's time to get ready to go out. It's Sunday but tomorrow is a holiday, so although I still have to work, I don't have to be there until 3. Most of my friends have the holiday off and we've planned a fun night tonight! 8:15 p.m. \u2014 I meet up with my boyfriend and he calls an Uber. We are meeting two of our friends at a big bowling alley and bar. I pay for my bowling shoes and two games ($21), and the boys cover apps and beers. After two competitive rounds of bowling, my friend and I split the cost of a pitcher of Moscow Mules that we share with everyone ($18.50).

My BF offers to pay, but I insist on at least splitting the bill, so I pay $8.50. (He makes more money than I do, but I like to pay some of the time.) We then head off to our separate gyms.  $8.50 11:30 a.m. \u2014 I get my workout in and take a quick shower at the gym before going to the Whole Foods around the corner. I tend to alternate between Whole Foods, Roche Bros. (near my work), and Trader Joe's (more out of the way, but they have a lot of stuff you can't get anywhere else, so I go every couple of weeks). Today I'm picking up stuff mainly for work lunches and easy dinners. I still have most of the produce from the market on Saturday so that helps keep the cost of this trip down. I get a spinach-kale mix, chicken breast, frozen blackened salmon, baba ganoush, cherry tomatoes, soy coffee creamer, frozen mango, bananas, fresh mozzarella, rolled oats, and chocolate covered pretzels ($54.76). I stop at CVS on the walk back to my apartment for toilet paper (I have a $2 off coupon) and also grab a half-off bag of M&Ms ($7.98).  $62.74 3 p.m. \u2014 Get to work; I'll be working from 3 p.m. until 11 this evening. I work a rotating schedule, which means days, evenings, overnights, weekends, and holidays. I do two 12-hour shifts and two eight-hour shifts per week and regularly pick up overtime. Although it makes for a wacky schedule between the off-shift differentials and occasional overtime, I'm able to make more money than my base. Tonight is fairly busy but uneventful. I eat pesto chicken that I made earlier today with a tomato-mozzarella salad for dinner.

One of my coworkers texts me and asks if I can grab her a cup of coffee on my way in. I gladly do so and get a latte for myself \u2013 triple shot, as I suspect today will be a long day. I tell my friend I'll treat her to the coffee but she ends up Venmo-ing me, plus a little extra.

It's another busy day at work \u2013 lots of sick little babies with respiratory infections and the flu this time of year, in addition to all the other patients. Working with pediatric patients can be hard sometimes, but it's also so rewarding. I work as a nurse's aide, and although this wasn't the job I had in mind when I graduated college with a BS in molecular biology, it has been a great learning experience.

I have a boot camp class at my gym at noon. (Classes are included in my membership fee.) On my way, I stop at TJ Maxx and pick up candles and a cute pair of PJs for my nephew \u2013 it's his birthday in a few weeks. I have a gift card, so I don't pay anything. 1:30 p.m. \u2014 Got my butt kicked at boot camp! I take a quick shower in the locker room and then head to a nearby caf\u00e9. Although I've already been accepted into grad school, I have one prerequisite class I must finish before I begin. I paid for the class out of pocket ($1,325), but my employer will reimburse 75% of that once I'm finished with it.

Somehow, I manage to fall back asleep. I stayed up until 2:30 a.m. last night perusing the shopping guide for a Bergdorf Goodman beauty event. (I only found out about it when a last-minute announcement hit my inbox just before midnight.) I rarely shop for skincare products, but the big discount was enticing. I ended up passing on the sale, though, because I just can't justify casually spending $1,000. 9 a.m. \u2014 I get woken up again, this time by my neighbor slamming his door. He does this all the time, so I always know when he leaves or comes home. We never say hi to each other in the hallway. Awkward. 10 a.m. \u2014 Get ready for work. I left my corporate job last year to pursue entrepreneurship with a group of friends. We run a hospitality management start-up, so our hours are irregular. I'm on call around the clock, but in return I get a flexible schedule and choice of work locations. 10:30 a.m. \u2014 I recently changed my makeup look to a warmer tone, which feels refreshing and makes my morning routine more exciting. I'm wearing Tom Ford's Cream and Powder Eye Color today, which I splurged on with a $50 Bloomingdales gift card last week. The golden peach color is dazzling. 11 a.m. \u2014 Subway to work. 11:30 a.m. \u2014 I snack on chocolate with a glass of soy milk while spending way too much time browsing food delivery websites for lunch ideas. I keep a handful of chocolate bars at work, and our office building provides free coffee, milk, and beers.

All our meals are treated by the owners, but I do the ordering because everyone trusts my foodie instincts.

The colorful dish makes me happy. 2 p.m. \u2014 My compensation package is finalized \u2013 I got the raise I wanted! This is no small triumph, because I tend to avoid confrontation. I immediately share the good news with my family and my best friend over text. 4 p.m. \u2014 My friend sends over housing options to help me out with moving. I can no longer tolerate the peeling paint and rampant mice in my current apartment, and I need to move out. I also have vacation on the mind \u2013 my family is spread out across the world, so we try to plan something special together every year. 6 p.m. \u2014 I go home to shower and relax. Then I watch YouTube videos while doing chores. I like self-help videos and motivational speeches, as well as cooking tutorials and travel videos. 7 p.m. \u2014 I eat marinated soft-boiled egg and frozen roasted sweet potatoes for dinner. I also finish up leftover bone broth with mushroom and goji berries that I made last weekend. I'm a decent cook and used to experiment with a lot of different recipes, but I have gradually reduced my cooking in favor of socializing more.

Today's lunch is Taiwanese bento boxes, and my pick is stewed pig's trotter with lotus root in a fermented bean curd sauce, which is served with white rice and cabbage. I order for two coworkers but only one of them shows up, so I save the extra food for later. ($47 expensed) 1 p.m. \u2014 While I was waiting in the pickup line, a guy walking by asked me about the truck and, after we talked for a minute, he gave me his business card. When I get back to my desk, I email him a link to the catering service's website. He had a cute French accent and was quite friendly, so I secretly hope to strike up more conversations with him. 4 p.m. \u2014 More coworkers swing by the office. Most people in my company work out in the field, so we only rent a miniscule space for office use. The noise makes it hard to concentrate, but it's also interesting to hear updates about other projects.

My coworkers indulge in beer and apple cider while I attempt to fit in with my sparkling water. I may not appreciate the taste of alcohol, but I certainly get the spirit! 9 p.m. \u2014 I leave the group with one other coworker. We chat a bit more about work and life on the subway before going our separate ways. I get home feeling still slightly hungry, so I eat a coconut-mango Nounos yogurt that I've been craving and a banana that's about to get too ripe. 11:30 p.m. \u2014 I watch eyeshadow palette review videos on YouTube to research for my next purchase. I have worn little-to-no makeup all my life, but I've had a passion for eyeshadow and lip color recently.

Today's menu is spicy hot pot with sliced fatty beef and assorted vegetables. I particularly love the springy sweet potato vermicelli that soaks up all the flavors of the soup. My coworker eats his in tears because of the spicy level. I make a mental note to get him something less spicy next time.

After posing my yogurt with props in the right lighting and finding a satisfactory angle and distance for the picture, I am able to eat my dinner in peace.

Otherwise it's like I didn't eat it, right?) 11 p.m. \u2014 I'm making an effort to go to bed earlier, which is hard due to the nature of my industry.

The meal turns out extraordinarily light and refreshing \u2013 we even ordered two extra main courses (of desserts). What a promising start for my weekend! The total bill is around $75, and my coworker/friend pays in return for my treat a while back. Advertisement 5:30 p.m. \u2014 I go to Express to return the unwanted clothes. I still want something real for dinner, so I walk over to Koreatown to get kimchi \u2013 I'm craving something crisp and pungent.

I've been considering getting a Ragdoll myself, so I talk to her and learn a ton about the breed. 11 p.m. \u2014 I listen to podcasts about intuitive eating until I fall asleep. I'm aware that I've had a somewhat distorted relationship with food ever since I started  dieting  around age 17.

I also throw in a couple of dried longan fruit for sweetness. I have a dinner plan with a friend at 8, so I cook a piece of frozen crab-stuffed shrimp to hold myself over until then. 8 p.m. \u2014 While waiting for my friend in the subway station, I see a cellist who performs there often.

I take my lunch break a little early and sit on the fluffy sofas between all of our offices. I notice my boyfriend got a little garlic happy on the salad, but at least I don't have to go buy lunch today. 6 p.m. \u2014 I decide to leave work a little early and continue one of my projects at home. I try to cook as many meals as I can at home; I have celiac disease, which is not the easiest in Germany. I go to the grocery store around the corner from my apartment and pick up spinach, bean sprouts, goat cheese, lactose-free milk, and other odds and ends. By the time I finish my work, I'm too tired to cook.

I get ready quickly for work with my boyfriend. He makes me espresso and steamed milk every morning, which saves me money on coffee. As usual, I forget my thermos at home and I have to turn back and run upstairs. Coffee is life. Advertisement 10 a.m. \u2014 I have about 100 emails when I get to the office. However, since I'm in a grumpy mood, I decide to restock some of my skincare that I've been holding off on rebuying. After filling my cart eight times with different things, I finally decide on Kanebo Moisture Flow Rich Lotion and my signature perfume, which has been empty for a while. Retail therapy always brightens my mood.  $137 1 p.m. \u2014 Since I was too tired and not feeling well yesterday, I didn't make anything to bring for lunch today. I run down to the supermarket and grab a salmon California roll and yogurt. I always chat with the workers who roll the sushi \u2014 they know to make me gluten-free rolls. The  yogurt reminds me of what I used to eat as a kid in the U.S.  $8 7 p.m. \u2014 I was sick most of last week and my boyfriend was too, so we decide to spend tonight in. Normally on Tuesdays, I go to the gym and he has psychology class, but we both skip. We make a salad for dinner, cuddle up on the couch, and begin to plan our upcoming Japan trip.

After having the flu for approximately two weeks, I am thrilled to finally be able to move around again. She isn't feeling so well, so we take it easy on the elliptical machines and chat. She's actually joining my company in two months, so we exchange office gossip. (I used to work at her old company.) She drives me home and we go to a small Venezuelan hole-in-the-wall arepa shop next to my apartment. Due to the lack of gluten-free options in Hamburg, I am a regular here. I get two arepas with black beans and plantains. I haven't seen her for a while, and I think it's my turn to treat.

I make an appointment for a 90-minute Thai massage after work ($55), and go into the office around lunchtime.  $55 3 p.m. \u2014 My perfume and moisturizer have arrived!

I leave the massage super refreshed, shower off, and walk 20 minutes to her apartment. She is making us dinner, so I buy strawberry sorbet for dessert. We catch up, as she has been on vacation for a couple of weeks, and then finish the rest of the entries for her taxes. I take the bus home because it's far too cold to walk.

When 11 p.m. rolls around, we all decide to call it a night and open up another bottle of wine at our place.

We settle into our seats for the show. 11 p.m. \u2014 We're back at the theater bar, taking rounds of vodka shots. I buy a round for everyone. We chill there for a while, then head to one of our favorite bars in the Schanze. We know the bartenders, who give us a discount on drinks. Our apartment is a mere couple of skips away, and we decide to call it a night around 1 a.m., though our friends have a second wave of energy and decide to stay out.

Perfect hangover food. 3 p.m. \u2014 We all settle in on our couch and immerse ourselves in a Netflix binge. Luckily, it's still snowing outside and we're all hungover. Needless to say, no one feels bad about having a day in. Our friend decides only fries will cure his hangover, and I walk to the nearby emergency apothecary and get aspirin for all of us.  $5 8 p.m. \u2014 Our friend leaves and we continue our lazy day mainly on the couch. We take a quick break and do yoga in our living room, before scrounging up leftovers for our dinner. I've been eyeing a pair of corduroy mom jeans online, and decide to order them. Nothing says obsession like having eight pairs of cord overalls and culottes. I check my work email so I won't have any surprises tomorrow morning. The weekend went by way too fast, and we don't have enough food in the house to meal prep for the week. Oh well.

Advertisement 4:15 p.m. \u2014 I'm pretty much over today emotionally, so I'm leaving work early to meet with a friend. I offered to drive to a new boba spot 15 minutes away, and we stay there chatting until they close at 10. I tell her what's been going on and tear up multiple times. She gives really good advice and affirmation about the whole situation, and I'm reminded that I have an amazing friend who looks out for me. I pay for our drinks because I think she got mine last time.  $12.77 10:30 p.m. \u2014 The minute I step foot inside the house, I realize that I skipped dinner and am starving. Thankfully my parents left grilled chicken salad in the fridge, which I inhale. I'm in bed by 11:30 but don't really sleep until 1. There's a lot on my mind.

I feel a little better today. 9:30 a.m. \u2014 Get to work a little later than usual, but I listen to a really good set of songs in the car on my way there and feel like today is going to be a good day. My friend is celebrating his birthday tonight and we're supposed to have dinner and head downtown after, so I'm excited to get my mind off of things and have fun. Advertisement 5:45 p.m. \u2014 I finally get to leave work! I was pretty productive today, but at the end I had to sit through a loooong meeting from 3 to 5 p.m., which made me SO tired. It was in a stuffy boardroom with zero circulation and a seemingly endless conversation about table games. I  excused myself to take a small lap just to get my blood flowing. 6:10 p.m. \u2014 I've spent the past two and a half weeks trying to grow out my eyebrows, and I've finally had enough of looking at my bushy brows. Plus, I'm going out tonight and want to look cute, so I go to my friendly neighborhood threading lady to get my brows and upper lip done. I tip $2.  $15 7:45 p.m. \u2014 I finish getting ready and leave for dinner. We're meeting at this vegan Chinese restaurant (which is a thing, and it's so good) called Veggie House in Chinatown. We all grub, and my friends are surprised at how good it is. We each pay for our share.  $20 10 p.m. \u2014 Two of my friends and I carpool downtown and as soon as we walk out of the parking garage, random men on the street start bothering us. One even gives my friend a piece of paper that says, \u201cDo you like me? Yes or No.\" Why are guys so strange and weird? Anyway, experiencing this makes me think about how whenever I'd go downtown with my ex, he always protected me from this kind of thing. But I promise myself I won't get sad and cry tonight (!), so I try to push it away by drinking a Tequila Sunrise at the bar inside the Fremont Hotel while we wait for others to come.  $8 Advertisement 11 p.m. \u2014 My friends love this small bar called Vanguard, so we head over and spend the rest of the night there. Usually this place has really good music to dance to, but for some reason the DJ tonight keeps playing the same songs over again (like \"Get Low\" by Lil Jon, THREE times). 12:45 a.m. \u2014 To my surprise, the birthday boy is very inebriated and decides he's gonna go home, so we all leave. One of the girls wants tacos, so we stop by Tacos El Gordo for late-night eats. I'm not really feeling tacos, so I try the campechana fries (mix of adobada and carne asada meat on top of fries, with guac, cheese, sour cream, and some other sauce they have) and I'm glad I ordered it. So good, but I can't have it again for a while!  $7.57 2 a.m. \u2014 I make sure all my friends got home safely, then wash my face and quickly fall asleep.

I just want to stop being heartbroken so I can have better dreams and sleep. I snooze a little bit more before getting up and going about my morning routine. My body feels tired, which makes me want to skip a party tonight just to go to sleep earlier, but that's a decision I'll make later. 9:20 a.m. \u2014 I have a project due Monday, and I want to finish 95% of it today. I have only one 30-minute meeting before lunch, so I should be able to focus on my project all day. Advertisement 1 p.m. \u2014 For a while I've been thinking of dyeing my hair grey/lavender (as an ombr\u00e9 or balayage), but I've been holding off because 1. it's expensive, 2. I work at a pretty traditional corporate office (ugh) and I'm pretty sure they have a policy against unnatural hair color, and 3. the necessary maintenance would suck. But since I'm going through a breakup, I'm thinking,  why the hell not just go for it ? I asked the analytics office admin if I would be breaking any HR rules, and she says to ask my VP if he's okay with it. 1:30 p.m. \u2014 I show my VP a picture of what I want my hair to look like. He is super laidback and says he has no problems with it. Yay! Operation Paint Me Lavender is a go! 5:30 p.m. \u2014 I get home and realize I forgot my laptop on my desk. Ugh. You know when you prepare yourself to do the thing you said you would do, but still end up forgetting to do it? Maybe I'll stop by this weekend to grab it. Highly unlikely, but I like thinking about it. I eat dinner with my parents. Dad got pizza! My kryptonite! My body is still tired, so I go upstairs to take a nap. 8 p.m. \u2014 My alarm goes off and I decide not to go to the party. I'm tired, and I feel like I need to take time for myself. I stalk my ex's Instagram and see that he deleted a lot of photos of us (though not everything). As much as I knew this was going to happen, I am still hurt. I'm not emotionally in a place to be around a bunch of people trying to have fun right now. Advertisement 2 a.m. \u2014 After hours of overthinking, I let go of my thoughts and sleep.

I'm meeting with a friend for brunch in a couple of hours, so I just have my daily tea with fruit while watching Netflix. 11 a.m. \u2014 I pick up my friend and drive us across town to a new brunch spot called Neighbors Cafe. It is so cute and there are lots of plants. I order a lavender latte and shakshuka. We catch up on each other's lives for a while and I'm surprisingly calm when I explain the breakup. I'm progressing! Closer to acceptance! Maybe!  $15.71 1:30 p.m. \u2014 My gas light goes on when I start my car, so I stop by the nearest gas station.  $29.87 2 p.m. \u2014 My friend needs to return a romper and I want to window shop to gather ideas for Coachella outfits, so we spend a little bit of time at the mall. By a little bit, I mean 30 minutes, because we both hate shopping and we're lazy. 2:15 p.m. \u2014 I drop off my friend at her house. There are yellow flowers that look like spiky dahlias in her yard, and when I mention how pretty they are, she hops out of the car and snips off three stems to give to me! So sweet. I need to replace my dying (read: dead) white lilies, and these happy-colored flowers will help brighten up my room. Advertisement 5:45 p.m. \u2014 I go to my sister's for dinner and then take her browned bananas with me to make banana bread tomorrow! 7:30 p.m. \u2014 I'm bored and I don't want to go home just yet (more like: I'm starting to feel sad again and can't be home alone), so I give shopping another try. I go to a different mall this time and walk out with chokers from H&M and a cute moto jacket from Old Navy, which is on sale.   $31.38 9:30 p.m. \u2014 Still don't wanna go home, so I go over to my friend's apartment to hang out. We both love nature photography and traveling in general, so we decide to go to Bryce Canyon next weekend for new shots and to get away from the city for a bit. He has to be at a work meeting at an ungodly hour tomorrow morning, so I go home. 11:15 p.m. \u2014 In bed, I spend time reaffirming myself. The universe has been kind to me the past two weeks, and I'm humbled. I am grateful for all of my friends who have reached out and taken the time to hear me out (some over and over). Emotionally, times are tough, but I am tougher. This sucks now, but it won't be forever. It's for the better.

This careless mistake will seriously delay my timeline. 11:45 a.m. \u2013 Leave my meeting famished, and wolf down a handful of almonds, a Trader Joe's salad, and a cup of cucumbers.

My coworkers talk about it not being a big deal, but my brother died from colon cancer a couple years ago (not that they know). A rubber factory was dumping carcinogenic material into our backyard and my whole neighborhood has some form of cancer or another.

She helps me hang pictures in my room that I've been procrastinating putting up, and we hang out and catch up before going to my favorite Cuban restaurant, La Isla, for dinner. 7:30 p.m. \u2014 The birthday surprises continue! My mom texted a bunch of my friends (without me knowing) to come over after we got back from dinner for cake and cupcakes.

I shower and pack up my lunch as well as some of the leftover cupcakes to bring in for my coworkers. I check my email as I'm heading out the door and see my VP emailed me about attending a client event with him after work today. UGH, it's going to be a late night. 12:30 p.m. \u2014 Today has been non-stop meetings and phone calls and I need a brain break! I heat up my lunch and check up on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram to see what I've missed today. I also remember that I need to buy something cheap and easy to cover up the holes in my bedroom wall (from past tenants hanging pictures), so I order a small tube of Patch Plus Primer on Amazon. My free Amazon Prime one-month trial isn't over yet, so shipping is free!  $7.43 Advertisement 5 p.m. \u2014 I take an Uber uptown to the event. It's not exactly the most exciting stuff, so I'm thrilled when my VP suggests we wrap up a little bit early. ($15.57 expensed) 8 p.m. \u2014 I know I'm not going to want to cook when I get home after such a long day, so I order a penne vodka pizza (my favorite) from this amazing pizzeria called Napoli's and then order an Uber home. I expense the Uber ($40.19) on my corporate card, since this was a client event, and enter a two-stop ride so I can scoop up the pizza on my way. Thankfully, I timed things perfectly and my pizza is ready as soon as we arrive.  $22.42 8:40 p.m. \u2014 When I get to my apartment, I find a big bouquet of roses waiting for me from my roommates as a post-birthday gift, since they were both away this past weekend. So sweet! The three of us catch up in the living room and make dinner plans for tomorrow night. There's a new hibachi restaurant in town that we've all been dying to try. I scarf down my pizza and call my friend to chat before watching a few episodes of  Love  and falling asleep around 11:30.

I stop into Bath & Body Works because I'm in the market for new candles, because the dozen I already have in my room isn't enough. I settle on a mint eucalyptus candle and head back to the office for another afternoon full of meetings and phone calls.  $26.67 3 p.m. \u2014 I have a client based in Tel Aviv who's in New York right now for a product photoshoot, so we decide to meet up for tea. She orders an earl grey tea and I get myself a green tea. I pick up the tab on my corporate card. I have to head back to the office for a call at 4, so both head out.

Mayor de Blasio announces in a press conference this afternoon that he's closing schools, so looks like we're getting a snow day! The snow is supposed to start tonight, so we all head out a bit early to prepare. 6:15 p.m. \u2014 A clothing subscription box I ordered arrives today, so I get charged for it. It's great because I don't even have to leave the house to shop, and the pieces that I receive are usually things I wouldn't pick out for myself but still end up loving. In today's box, I got seven items of clothing. I decide to keep five: a bomber jacket, two sleeveless shirts, and two cute short-sleeved shirts. I'm going to send back a cocktail dress, since I don't have an immediate need for it, and a pair of jeans that don't fit very well.  $255.20 Advertisement 7:30 p.m. \u2014 My roommates and I have been trying to nail down a night for all of us to go out to dinner, and we're finally all free tonight. We head over to the hibachi restaurant with a couple of bottles of wine since the place is BYOB. I always get unreasonably stressed when the cook tosses food in everyone's mouths, because I never catch it, but on the third try, I catch the piece of zucchini that he tosses my way! I'd consider this a successful trip.  $36.65 10:30 p.m. \u2014 We're all a little bit buzzed getting back to the apartment and each have another glass of wine in the kitchen before heading to bed.

We chat through the day's priorities and plan to reconnect again at the end of the day. We're super busy today, which stresses me out. It's much harder to work quickly on my small laptop as opposed to the giant desktop I have in the office, but I throw on my headphones and start jamming on a few projects. 12:30 p.m. \u2014 One of my roommates is working from home as well today, and since I've had a really productive morning, I step away from my computer for a bit and we chat and have lunch together. We talk about watching a movie later, but she and her boyfriend get into an argument, so she has to deal with that for a while. Yikes. Advertisement 5 p.m. \u2014 My friends who live a few floors down text me to say that they're ordering food and wine. I really shouldn't order food since I have plenty of groceries to make dinner, but it's a snow day, so I cave and go downstairs. I bring my laptop to their apartment to work a bit longer and then log off when the food gets delivered. I pay for my share.  $11 7 p.m. \u2014 After we're all a couple of glasses of wine deep, we decide to play Heads Up. We're all pretty buzzed at this point, so the game is even more hilarious than usual, and we end up having so much fun that we don't realize we've been playing for hours! The night is winding down and so is the snow, so there's definitely no chance of a snow day tomorrow. I head back up to my apartment around 11:30, throw on sweatpants, and hop into bed.

Made a quick dinner of buffalo chicken, asparagus, brussels sprouts, and campfire potatoes for dinner while watching the newest episode of  Westworld  during dinner on the couch.

Stop for my chai on my way. 9 a.m. \u2014 Make it to work, get myself settled, catch up on paperwork, and meet with my intern. She's great and I'm excited to see all the progress she's making. My fianc\u00e9 made me quinoa, butternut squash, and chicken. He's an excellent cook, which makes my life better. 4 p.m. \u2014 Help a coworker practice her interviewing skills and then head out of the office with my intern. She has class and I'm meeting a friend for dinner in a similar area. 5:30 p.m. \u2014 I meet my friend at Kashkaval for fondue. We met at my old job and it's great to have a friend who is also a social worker. We catch up over happy hour wine, truffle fondue, and hummus. We both complain about long hours and being underpaid and overworked. She is one of the nicest people I've met in a long time. We talk each other into getting chocolate bread pudding before calling it a night.  $50.08 Advertisement 9:30 p.m. \u2014 Another friend of mine is here for work and staying a few blocks away from the restaurant. I meet him at his hotel and we go to a bar around the corner to catch up. I don't see him often because he lives across the country, but we talk all the time and it's really nice to talk in person. We get a few drinks and then he insists on going to Starbucks since we're both big fans and it's still open. I don't get anything, though, and head home after.  $27.26 11:30 p.m. \u2014 I get home exhausted, talk to my fianc\u00e9 for a bit, wash my face, take out my schoolwork for tomorrow, and then go to bed.

I always eat quickly at work because things can happen at any second. 3 p.m. \u2014 My coworker's adorable toddler comes to the office and I spend the rest of my day playing with her. Five o'clock rolls around and I leave to make it to class. 6 p.m. \u2014 I grab a Starbucks chai before my trauma class, which is really interesting and very useful in my current job. I'm two classes away from my second master's and am so excited to be done with going to work and school at the same time.

He tells me he's still at work and isn't sure when he's going to get off, so I go home and make myself a quick avocado toast with poached eggs and feta.

(I use my sister's account.) Advertisement", "day_one": "Day One: 5:30 a.m. \u2014 Ugh. The alarm is especially rough this morning. It's the first day back to school after two weeks of glorious spring vacation. I spent 10 days traveling, and returning to reality is not welcome. I flew in early Friday morning, and then spent all day yesterday sleeping and feeling incredibly jet-lagged, so my sleep schedule is very off this morning. In the UAE, we work Sundays through Thursdays, so I don't have another day to catch up before going back to work. 6:40 a.m. \u2014 After showering and getting ready for the day, I leave for work. Usually I pack my breakfast and lunch, but I didn't have time to go grocery shopping and re-stock my fridge yesterday, so I don't follow my routine this morning. I stop at Costa on my way to work and get a large coffee with soy milk and an almond milk oatmeal parfait.  $9.50 7 a.m. \u2014 I arrive at work and rush to prepare myself for the day. After two weeks off, getting back into teaching mode is hard, and I need to review my lessons for today. Luckily, I have the first block off and have time to orient myself. 7:40 a.m. \u2014 Well...so much for free time this morning. Another social studies teacher (and one of my closest friends) is still in the Seychelles, and the school forgot to schedule a sub for her. I volunteer to cover for her and take her class, since I know what they're learning. Advertisement 12:05 p.m. \u2014 After teaching all morning, lunch is a welcome break. However, since I don't have my usual packed lunch, I have to run down to the caf\u00e9 and grab a smoothie and energy bar. I hate buying food here, but I'm desperate.  $6 2:45 p.m. \u2014 The day is over \u2014 thank goodness! Today was a busy day, since I taught another two classes in the afternoon. Compared to teaching in the U.S., my teaching load is pretty light, so I can't complain too much. 3:30 p.m. \u2014 After spending a few minutes grading and catching up on emails after school, I head to the gym. In order to save money, I use the gym at my school. They have the basic equipment that I need, and I like being able to get my workouts in before I go home and lose motivation. I used to be self-conscious about being in workout gear with my kids around, but I've started to get used to it. Today is cardio and leg day, and I get a great workout in after taking the past two weeks off. 6 p.m. \u2014 After I finish my workout, I head directly to the grocery store. This store is a little out of my way, but they have the best prices and selection of items. I'm vegan, and most of the products I buy are a bit more expensive than if I ate a normal diet, but it's worth it for me. I have to stock up after being gone on vacation, so it's a big trip. I buy tofu, spinach, broccoli, bananas, carrots, soy milk, dairy-free yogurt, protein crackers, corn starch, rice cakes, peanut butter, soy sauce, peanut sauce, chili sauce, and mustard.  $77.05 Advertisement 7:30 p.m. \u2014 On my drive home I call my mom and chat for a bit. (I pay extra to have international calling on my cell plan.) Get home, put away my groceries, snack on carrots and yogurt, and start to prep dinner. During the week I generally eat the same thing for dinner: tofu coated in cornstarch, lightly saut\u00e9ed, and seasoned with a mixture of sauces (tonight it's soy, peanut, and garlic), plus steamed broccoli. 8:30 p.m. \u2014 Finish dinner, do the dishes, and make my lunch for tomorrow: a smoothie made of one banana, protein powder, powdered peanut butter, and ice cubes, plus rice cakes. 9 p.m. \u2014 Spend a few minutes putting a load in the washing machine and changing my sheets. I wait around for the cycle to finish so I can hang my clothes before showering and heading to bed. It takes me awhile to fall asleep because my sleep schedule is still off, but I'm out by 11. Daily Total: $92.55", "day_two": "Day Two: 5:30 a.m. \u2014 I was going to try and get up early this morning to get cardio in before school. Unfortunately though, I woke up at 3 a.m. to a \"we need to talk about some stuff\" text from my long distance BF. We both have a lot of trust issues, and my anxiety kicks in hard after this message. I wasn't able to fully fall back asleep until 5 a.m. 6:45 a.m. \u2014 Shower, get dressed, grab my lunch, and head to work. I only live about about a 10-minute drive to school, and try to get in by 7 a.m. at the latest every day. In any other city, I'd walk to work if it were this close to where I live, but there are no sidewalks on the route and the area of Dubai I live in isn't very walking-friendly. Advertisement 7 a.m. \u2014 I get to school and spend a few minutes answering emails before the kids come in at 7:30. I make a cup of coffee in the break room (instant coffee is free...not the best tasting, but free!), and add the soy milk that I bring in from home every week. I snack on rice cakes too. 8 a.m. \u2014 I have first block free again this morning, but have a few meetings. 12:05 p.m. \u2014 Lunchtime. I have my smoothie and rice cakes while leading a student council meeting in my room. I'm the faculty adviser for a student club at school. It's a bit more work, but I get an extra $1,000 stipend per year, which is nice. 2:45 p.m. \u2014 After lunch, I teach another class and then have a department meeting to finish off the day. Overall, it's a pretty easy afternoon. 3:30 p.m. \u2014 Finish up the day by planning a lesson for next week, and then head over to the gym. Do running intervals, followed by my least favorite workout of the week: shoulders. 6 p.m. \u2014 Finish working out and head for home. I call my parents on the way home and talk to them about summer plans and some decisions I have to make for my housing next year. 6:30 p.m. \u2014 I snack on carrots, crackers, and yogurt while making tofu with broccoli for dinner again. I watch  Love it or List It  (a secret obsession of mine) on YouTube while eating dinner and cleaning up. I make my lunch for the next day as well.

Losing a few hours of sleep wasn't fun, but we needed to talk and it was worth me being a bit sleepy this morning. Luckily we talked things out and I feel a lot less anxious now. I quickly shower, get ready for work, and still leave for school on time. 7 a.m. \u2014 Get to work and make my coffee. 12:05 p.m. \u2014 I use my lunch hour to run to the bank and withdraw cash. My good friend from work is getting married in France this summer in a chateau. They invited some of their closest friends to stay in the chateau for the the week, and I need to pay her in advance. It's pricey, but all meals are included, and it'll be an awesome week. Worth the cost!  $200 1:45 p.m. \u2014 After lunch, I only have one more block to teach. And then after school we have our weekly all school meeting. 4 p.m. \u2014 I head to the gym for my workout. I run for awhile and then have a chest- and glutes-focused lift. Advertisement 6 p.m. \u2014 I finish at the gym and head home to shower and change. I'm meeting friends for drinks later, but before I leave the house, I cook dinner: my usual meal of tofu and broccoli. I don't have time to eat before having to leave, but I also don't want to spend the money on dinner while we're out, so I'll wait until I'm home later to have a full meal. 8 p.m. \u2014 I walk to meet a few friends at a bar. Tonight is Ladies' Night, so we can have unlimited drinks for free. (A lot bars and restaurants in Dubai offer Ladies' Nights on different weeknights where they have free drinks, and sometimes meals, for women.) I meet my friends and we spend a few hours drinking and catching up. This bar has an amazing drink called a Pinky Swear, and while I don't drink enough to really get buzzed, I am definitely happier by the time we leave. 10 p.m. \u2014 I head home pretty early and re-heat my dinner.

Advertisement 12:05 p.m. \u2014 Lunchtime. Usual smoothie and rice cakes that I brought from home. 2:45 p.m. \u2014 School's out. I had my favorite class (I know we aren't supposed to play favorites, but we totally do) for my last block. We spend a large part of the class talking about current events, specifically gun laws in the U.S. Part of me worries about losing instruction time, but I also hate to stop the students when they are so invested and interested in the world around them. 3 p.m. \u2014 My friend and I head down to the conference room for a surprise baby shower for one of our colleagues. I bid her my congratulations and head back to my classroom to work for a few minutes. 4 p.m. \u2014 Gym time. I'm incredibly sore and don't get my full cardio in, but still manage to do a mini stair workout and lift. 6 p.m. \u2014 I call my dad on my drive home, and then make my usual tofu for dinner, this time with spinach. I was supposed to go out to dinner with other friends tonight, but I'm too tired and decide to cancel. 8 p.m. \u2014 After cleaning up, I make my lunch and put away my clean clothes.

I'm applying for some additional positions within the school next year, and need to finish my applications. 12:05 p.m. \u2014 I have my usual smoothie and rice cakes. A couple of my students wander in while I'm eating and want to chat. Sometimes I need my own space and kick them out, but today I'm okay with the visit. They start pulling up YouTube videos on my SMART Board and show me what a \"Walmart Yodeler\" is. I enjoy the little silly break with them. 2:45 p.m. \u2014 Made it to the weekend! Had another great class this afternoon to end the week on a high note. In addition to my kids getting the work done that I had planned, we also had some great conversation today. 4 p.m. \u2014 Last workout of the week. I don't have a ton of motivation this afternoon but manage to get it done. I save the easiest day of my workout cycle for Thursday \u2013 cardio followed by biceps and triceps! 6 p.m. \u2014 I head home, shower, change quickly, and then drive over to my friend's apartment for dinner. Despite seeing each other in school every day, we haven't hung out in awhile. Her fianc\u00e9 is on a business trip and we often have dinner together when he's away. We were going to cook, but instead decide to order Lebanese: hummus, baba ganoush, falafel, fattoush, and bread. We split the cost. After a few hours of eating, watching reality TV, and gossiping, I head home.  $15 Advertisement 11 p.m. \u2014 I promised another friend that I'd go out with him tonight. He's a promoter and every weekend has tables at different clubs that he needs to fill. I used to go out with him nearly every weekend, but got sick of the club lifestyle quickly. But I do enjoy going out with him occasionally, and it's good to catch up. I change clothes and he picks me up and drives us downtown. The drinks at the club are free since we're at a table, so the night doesn't cost me anything. 3 a.m. \u2014 We stay until the club closes and then my friend drives me home.

Brunching is a big thing in Dubai, and today we're going to one of my favorite spots. It's at a beach club, and along with the unlimited food and drink, you also get pool access and can spend the day in the sun. I try to keep my brunches limited to once or twice a month because of how expensive they are. My friend decides to drive again today, so no Uber cost for the morning.  $80 Advertisement 5 p.m. \u2014 We spend the afternoon drinking, eating, and tanning. I've never met any of the people we're out with, but I get along well with some of the girls. Brunch ends at 5 p.m., and tonight is a dry night in Dubai. Today is Al-Israa' and Al-Miraj, an Islamic holiday, and on certain holidays the government mandates that there can be no alcohol sold in order to respect the Muslim laws. Normally we'd hang around the club after brunch ends, but they stop serving alcohol almost immediately. 5:30 p.m. \u2014 My friend has another friend who's taking his yacht out for the evening, and he invites me to join. He pays for our Uber to the marina to meet them. 10 p.m. \u2014 We spend a few hours cruising around. Yacht parties are one of my favorite things to do here; I love seeing the city from a different angle and being out on the water. Usually everyone chips in to rent the boat and buys food and drinks to bring, but the host has covered the cost of everything tonight. We dock out by the deserted World Islands (a Dubai tourist attraction that they gave up on building) and swim for awhile. After brunch and an evening out, everyone's pretty drunk by the time we dock again. 11 p.m. \u2014 I grab a cab with my friend and we head home. We live near each other, so it's easy to split.

I haven't properly cleaned my place since getting back from break, so my apartment is a bit of a wreck. 11 a.m. \u2014 I'm hungry and too lazy to cook, so I order a salad and hummus toast from one of my favorite caf\u00e9s around. While I'm waiting for my food to arrive, I start an episode of  Outlander . My BF recommended it, and I'm obsessed.  $20 1 p.m. \u2014 After I eat, I pop down to the pharmacy that's below my building. Apparently last night I cut my legs on barnacles while swimming, and I need bacterial cream. The pharmacist ended up having some small sample packs and gave me some for free. I can go down and get more from the school nurse if I need it tomorrow, so I don't even have to spend any money! Win. I spend the afternoon pretending to get work done and grade papers. In reality, I just watch more  Outlander  and hang out. 5 p.m. \u2014 I throw tofu, spinach, and rice on the stove for dinner. I realize that I'm out of water, so I call down to the Blue Mart across the street and they bring up my order.

We've been sleep training him for the past two days using the leave and check method, and it's really paying off. I know people judge parents who sleep train, but in my opinion, it's short-term pain for long-term gain, for the whole family. I feel energized, so I get out of bed and make zucchini bread. My husband's in Shanghai for work, so I don't worry about waking him up. As the bread cooks, I read the  New York Times , Politico, and Refinery29.

Since I'm only working part-time, I like filling my days off with fun activities I know my son will enjoy.  $167.30 5 p.m. \u2014 We give our helper the night off (the scallops and spiced cauliflower can wait until Monday) and order sushi for everyone: oshiniko maki, chukka wake gunkan, edamame, salmon sashimi, maguro sushi, salmon sushi, spicy tuna maki, salmon aburi, and three pieces of salmon teriyaki. The food in Singapore is ridiculously good. We've been living here for four years and I've only ever had one bad meal (that was at a tourist trap, so it doesn't really count). I dry cook a piece of the sashimi for our son and mash it up a little \u2014 he seems to enjoy the taste. He's only been on solids for a few weeks, so it's still a bit of trial and error.  $68.60 Advertisement 7 p.m. \u2014 After our son is asleep, my husband and I chat for a couple of hours about his trip and drink G&Ts. We remember we wanted to watch Ricky Gervais's new Netflix special, and spend an hour parked in front of the TV trying not to nod off. Not that the special isn't good, we're just too tired to fully enjoy it. We go to bed at 10. Daily Total: $3,741.90", "day_three": "Day Three: 7 a.m. \u2014 It's Sunday and my husband's playing soccer later on, so I make a big breakfast: cappuccinos, carrot cake pancakes, black currant coconut yogurt, and fresh grapefruit, kiwi, and strawberries. My son eats oatmeal with black currants again. Afterward, we take our son to the pool, practicing some of the things his swimming teacher taught him in his last lesson. It's already so hot, the pool is almost like a bath. We still haven't gotten used to the scorching, humid weather here. I don't think we ever will! 10 a.m. \u2014 The sandals I ordered last week were delivered yesterday, and they're too small, so I go online and return them (refund of $189.28). There are no bigger sizes in that style, so I find a replacement pair, but also end up buying an additional pair that's on sale as well.  $323.99 11:30 a.m. \u2014 We go to watch my husband play soccer. His team wins, but it's bittersweet because so many of his teammates are leaving Singapore within the next month. That's the problem with the expat life \u2014 so many friends move away when their jobs here finish up, or they get a better offer somewhere else. I've been to more farewell parties than I can count. I wonder how this will affect my son as he grows up here. Will he have expat friends moving away all of the time? My husband reminds me that we too will be moving away, one day. We're definitely not planning on living here forever. It's an amazing country, but there are so many other places in the world we'd love to live in. As we head home (after paying for parking), we fill up the car with gas.  $160.05 Advertisement 6 p.m. \u2014 I cook dinner while my husband does the bedtime routine \u2014 jerk chicken with a kale, cranberry, and tahini salad. I find some vanilla sugar in the cupboard and quickly whip up some almendrados (lemon cookies) for dessert. After we eat, we play a few games of Scrabble, and then review our five-year savings plan Excel sheet. We add our new childcare costs, as well as the school fees that will start late next year when our son starts nursery school. My husband and I both grew up in genuine poverty, and it's extremely comforting for both of us to have clearly defined financial goals, although I don't think I will ever feel financially secure. That's what a childhood marked by neglect does to you, I guess. My husband is paid well, but we're very conscious of living well within our means and building a solid nest egg. We're in bed by 10:30, listening to our son's breathing on the monitor. Daily Total: $484.04", "day_four": "Day Four: 6 a.m. \u2014 I wake up early to make our usual weekday breakfast smoothie: kale, frozen boysenberries, cacoa nibs, hemp seeds (which I found out yesterday are now illegal to import into Singapore), zero-carb protein powder, and almond milk. My husband starts work super early every day, so he always takes his to go, with a bottle of water. I feed our son and then we all pile into the car. I drop my husband off at work, driving through one toll on the way home.  $1.50 Advertisement 7:45 a.m. \u2014 The nanny's at home when I get back. We do a quick review of everything she needs to know (what food my son's eating, how much expressed breastmilk to thaw for his milk feeds, his new favorite toy, etc.) before I jump in the shower, get ready for work, kiss my son goodbye, and get back in the car. I get to the office at 9:30 a.m. 1 p.m. \u2014 I'm seriously slammed, trying to fit a week's worth of work into the three days I'm in the office. I make a decaf coffee in the office kitchen, eat a lactation bar I brought from home (they help maintain milk production), and then settle in for a long afternoon. I suddenly remember that I need to do a massive online grocery shop, so I quickly organize that after I check with my helper if she wants anything. I buy a wide variety of fruit, heaps of herbs, eggs, spinach, kale, cucumbers, tomatoes, lettuce, shallots, beetroot, capsicum, leeks, fennel, chicken breast, salmon fillets, beef steaks, oxtail, scallops, cheese, almond milk, steel cut oats, macadamias, cashews, fresh coconuts, coconut flour, almond flour, almond butter, cashew butter, beef jerky, seaweed snacks, honey, maple syrup, butter, olive oil, crackers, toilet paper, nappies, cleaning supplies, tissues, and rubber gloves. This should last us about eight days, with additional trips to the shops as needed.  $592.35 6 p.m. \u2014 I leave work and pick up my husband on the way home, hitting two peak hour tolls. Our son's just finished his bath when we get home, and we take over from the nanny. After our son is in bed, we eat the scallops and spiced cauliflower dinner prepared by our helper. It's amazing, as always. Afterward, my husband has more work to do, and I'm helping a colleague finalize a journal article we've been working on for the past few months. I work on that for most of the evening. I go to bed at 10 p.m. and read until my husband gets into bed at 11.  $2 Advertisement Daily Total: $595.85", "day_five": "Day Five: 6 a.m. \u2014 Same smoothie and work drop-off routine as yesterday (road toll, again). As I'm leaving to go to work, the nanny says she won't be able to work tomorrow due to an unexpected family health issue. I put a reminder in my phone to organize a replacement for tomorrow ASAP.  $1.50 10 a.m. \u2014 I have a lull in my day and grab a matcha latte with a coworker. She paid last time, so it's my turn to pay. As much as I love spending time with my kid, I find being at work and around adults seriously enjoyable. My coworker and I chat about some issues she's having with one of our coworkers, and I try to give her some practical advice. On the way back to the office, I buy a Caesar salad with extra chicken to eat at lunch. I'm so hot from all the wandering and can feel sweat prickling my face. Singapore's humidity is murderous!  $19.35 6 p.m. \u2014 Same office pick-up routine as yesterday. When we get home, we find out that one of our nephews injured himself at school today and has to stay in the hospital overnight for observation, just as a precaution. My brother gives us regular updates, but I feel pretty bad about being so far away and unable to visit him. After our son is asleep, I hop online and buy a few gifts from a toy store near my brother's house, which will be delivered tomorrow. My husband and I also send him a \"get well\" video message over WhatsApp. Singapore is great, but I miss home!  $108.25 Advertisement 7 p.m. \u2014 After our son is asleep, we eat roasted tomato and quinoa soup for dinner. Afterward, I decide I need to get back into working out regularly, and spend 30 minutes doing a Tracy Anderson DVD. I love workout DVDs and online subscriptions \u2014 they're so much more convenient than the gym. The workout hurts, but I enjoy it. Then I take a quick shower and read in bed while my husband keeps working. I fall asleep before he gets into bed.

It takes me longer to get out of the house today, as the substitute nanny needs to be more fully briefed about looking after my son. I get to work at 10 and try to avoid running into my boss. (It works \u2014 I don't think he noticed I was late.) 12:30 p.m. \u2014 I manage to duck out for lunch with my husband. We try to do this once a week, but our normal work schedules are crazy, so it's often impossible. We go to our favorite place overlooking Marina Bay. I have lobster risotto to start and then pork belly, and he has tuna ceviche and then roast chicken. We drink sparkling water.  $177.45 3 p.m. \u2014 I'm doing an online writing course in my spare time, and one of the instructors recommended a particular book in the last lesson. I find it secondhand online (it's been out of print for decades) and order it with express shipping.  $19.50 Advertisement 6 p.m. \u2014 My husband has a work function tonight, so I make my way home alone (hitting the road toll). I pay the nanny before she heads home. After I put my son to bed, I eat dinner \u2014  baked beetroot, goat cheese, pine nut, and arugula salad, with sumac lamb meatballs. My helper is seriously the best. I don't know what I'd do without her. After dinner, I take the opportunity to do some writing for my course.

When we get home, I feed my son some pur\u00e9ed fruit and then we play. He's so cute! 10 a.m. \u2014 After my son wakes up from his nap, we head to a playgroup meet-up at a friend's place. There are 10 other mom friends there with their babies, all around the same age as my son. It's so much fun watching the babies spend time with each other. We chat about mom stuff and politics (Trump, of course, and Comey's new book), and a few of the ladies ask me how it's been going back to work after having the baby \u2014 they're about to do the same and want some pointers. I try to focus on the positives, but don't hide the fact that it's a serious juggling act. Advertisement 2 p.m. \u2014 On the way home, I decide to drop into the shops to stock up on some supplies for our short holiday to Borneo next weekend. My son's doctor recommended that we buy pre-made food pouches to feed him, as Hep-B is a risk in Borneo and he can't get vaccinated against that until he's 12 months old. I buy a bunch of different varieties, plus extra kid-safe sunscreen. I grab a honeydew milk tea with tapioca pearls on the way out. I get the low-sugar option, but it's still ridiculously sweet. Worth it.  $84.60 6 p.m. \u2014 My husband gets home early from work, and we bathe and feed our son together. I'm making dinner tonight, as our helper is feeling unwell. I decide to keep it simple, and make cashew \"hummus\" dip with veggie sticks, plus cheese and crackers. We have fruit for dessert.

We get up and get dressed. As is the case on most days, I don't do a hair and makeup routine besides mascara and a pony tail. We load the dog in the car and drive to the dog park a few blocks away. No one else is there yet this morning (I guess we're early) and our dog is happy that no one else is chasing after his ball. We just returned from a two-week vacation in Myanmar, so we're happy to be reunited with him again and to not have to deal with dog park drama/gossip. Advertisement 9 a.m. \u2014 Back at home, I make coffee in our French press and cook up a breakfast of scrambled eggs with mozzarella and toast with butter. We watch a little  Late Show with Stephen   Colbert  while we eat and then I start my work day. M. and I both work from home, though he's about to begin a new job that will require him to be in a downtown office most days. This will probably be a good change, as it's difficult to balance both being home around each other all the time! We share a home office, but for the most part we try to work in separate parts of the house during the day. I travel to Asia and Canada (I know, not the most logical division of territories) to work with customers nearly 50% of the year, so while that provides some separation, it's still a lot of time together when we're both home. 12:30 p.m. \u2014 Another downside to working from home is that I get SO snacky, but I'm good at limiting my munching between meals. I bring my laptop into the kitchen and read blogs while eating re-heated homemade arugula and asparagus pizza with a side of a Trader Joe's salad kit. I feed the puppy and then head to my couch office. Tomorrow I'll kick this habit and go back to my real desk. I get a text from Rover.com that they're offering me a free 30-minute dog walk today. I happily accept the offer and book a walk with a woman who has walked our dog before. I take a break from work to let her in and she heads off with our dog for an afternoon walk. When she returns, she is happy to report they had a great time and that he barked at a stone statue in someone's yard. Ha! I tip $4 through the app.  $4 Advertisement 5 p.m. \u2014 Work-wise, I'm at a good stopping point for the day, as I've been trying to get my post-vacation inbox down to zero and I've made good progress so far. I shut things down, get changed into running clothes, and load the dog into the car. I'm currently training for a 25K trail race in two months, which is far longer and more difficult than anything I've ever run. I'm totally not a naturally gifted runner, so I'm trying hard to stick to my training plan, though I'm still struggling through the shorter distances. Today I have to do five miles, but after coming off of two weeks of minimal training, I know it's going to be tough. I drive to a trailhead in the foothills and start off with my dog running laps around me along the way. The hilly run is hellish, but I make it 4.6 miles with minimal uphill walking breaks, which is good enough for me! On the way home, I stop to fill up my empty tank.  $34.05 6:45 p.m. \u2014 Back at home, I meet up with my friend who rents the tiny studio apartment attached to our garage. She's been living there for a few months, and it's been fun having her so close, plus our dogs love to play together. We drive downtown to a brewery together to meet up with another friend for a Kegfit class. I'm new to this scene, but Kegfit is exactly what it sounds like \u2013 crossfit with kegs! They partner with a brewery, and for $8, you get a class in the back of the brewery and a free pint of beer after. The class is crazy fun, but I know I'll be sore for days after. The recovery beer helps a bit.  $8 Advertisement 8 p.m. \u2014 M. and I go out to get tacos at a little Mexican grocery store nearby. I get five mini tacos and a Corona, and M. gets a Tecate and a torta. I pay and tip, and he Venmos me his half. We get home, and I shower and put on my Costco flannel penguin jammies. I read my book ( Hotel Kerobokan , about a prison in Bali \u2014 not my usual genre of choice, but I found it abandoned on a table in Myanmar and had nothing else to read at the time) and then fall asleep with the puppy at my feet.  $10.20 Daily Total: $56.25", "day_two": "Day Two: 7:45 a.m. \u2014 This morning, M. woke up early to go backcountry skiing with a friend, so I'm on dog duty. We get to the dog park a bit later, so some of the other regulars are there and we catch up while our dogs chase each other around. After my dog is sufficiently worn out, we head home to start the day. I make a gourmet meal of instant oatmeal and add a dollop of plain Greek yogurt and agave sweetener. I eat my breakfast with coffee and the  New York Times  app, wondering what horrifying shenanigans the GOP has been up to overnight. I start my work day at the kitchen table as I eat, but soon move to the office with a second cup of coffee and a Yo-Yo Ma Spotify playlist. 11:30 a.m. \u2014 I'm feeling productive today, working through a challenging task of trying to get customers to buy a bunch of inventory that we overproduced. Eventually M. gets home, excited to tell me about his morning in the backcountry. I make us both TJ's frozen turkey burgers with arugula and mozzarella (I only set the smoke detectors off three times in the process) and head back to the office after eating. Advertisement 3 p.m. \u2014 Today is my sister's birthday, and while I remembered to mail her a card, I still haven't gotten her a gift. I browse Amazon and look at Portland restaurant gift cards, but I want to make sure I get her something she'd actually use. I know she has an upcoming trip to Portugal, so I decide to hold off on a gift and offer her some of my Expedia hotel points for her trip instead. 4 p.m. \u2014 Finish planning my upcoming work trip that begins next weekend. My travel schedule has been crazy this year, so I'm really glad for these few slow weeks in one place. While traveling on someone else's expense (hello, long-haul business class!) and collecting frequent flyer miles is exciting, being away so much is exhausting. I close my computer and contemplate skipping my run for today since I'm feeling so lethargic, but I compromise with myself and do three grueling miles around the neighborhood instead of my planned five. Not sure how I'm going to do this race but\u2026whatever. 5:30 p.m. \u2014 After an afternoon glass of wine on the back porch with my friend while we watch our dogs play, M. and I go around the block for dinner with a couple we met at church. We're both not particularly religious, but I grew up going to church and have known it to be one of the best ways to connect with people in the community. So far, so good! We eat tortellini soup, asparagus, and bread while chatting about our lives, swooning over their new baby girl, and finishing things off with homemade rhubarb pie. After a few rounds of the board game \"Codenames,\" we leave them to put their baby to bed and meet up with our friend and her dog to go to one of the many Boise bars that allow dogs. We talk about our dreams of investing in tiny homes and a mutual friend's upcoming baby shower. We get Stone IPAs, which I put on my tab because I'm feeling extra generous.

I guess I haven't been drinking much lately, so it's really hitting me! M. lets me sleep a bit longer while he does solo dog park duty and I eventually get my bum out of bed, make coffee, and collect the trash, recycling, and compost for pickup. When M. and the dog get back, I make us eggs fried in coconut oil and toast with peanut butter. Not the best combination, but it works! I'm always extremely hungry from the moment I wake up, so breakfast is non-negotiable for me. 11 a.m. \u2014 After a few hours of work, we realize that it's the first Friday of the month, which means our local co-op has deals, deals, deals! We always shop there on sale days or whenever we want to stock up on locally-sourced meat. Today we buy a dog toy for our angel child (dog toys are sooo expensive, and he destroys everything, so we spend about 10 minutes trying to decide which toy to invest in), two bottles of wine, local steelhead trout, two NY strip steaks, eggs, romaine lettuce, quick oats, Bubbies pickles (the BEST), Siggi's yogurt, and two cans of Blue Sky soda. We use our monthly 10% member discount and split the total.  $39.52 12:30 p.m. \u2014 Speaking of expensive pet stuff, our dog needs a new collar, since he's grown out of his current one. We take a measurement and I order one off Wilderdog's site. M. Venmos me half. I stick two more turkey burgers in the oven and try to avoid repeating yesterday's smoke detector mishap. We load the burgers with mozzarella, pickles, and mustard, and wrap them in lettuce. Halfway through lunch, M. informs me that I have mustard on my face, per usual. I'm a messy eater, what can I say?  $15.50 Advertisement 4:30 p.m. \u2014 I finish some compliance trainings for work and am too much in Friday mode to start another big project I have this month. I promise myself I'll begin on Monday, and log off for the day. M. gets back from a run and I change into shorts and a t-shirt so we can get to work weeding the front yard. We take a quick water and peanut butter Clif Bar break somewhere in between pulling weeds and cleaning debris. The neighbors from next door stop by and invite us to take a tour of the new house they're building in the lot next to ours. It's modern, beautifully built, and absolutely huge \u2014 it feels like it's towering over our house! They were really lucky to snag this property (as were we with our house!) because Californians keep \u201cdiscovering\u201d the cheap cost of living in Boise, buying property, and driving our costs up! (Sorry, CA \u2013 I love you, but you can go home after you visit!) 6:45 p.m. \u2014 M. moves to the backyard where he weed whacks and mows, and I help by picking up all the dog poo that has accumulated. When I'm finished, I wash up and start making mashed potatoes to go with dinner. I season asparagus with TJ's garlic salt and olive oil, salt and pepper the strip steaks, and toss together a simple green salad with romaine, arugula, and TJ's champagne pear dressing. M. tosses the asparagus and steak on the grill when he finishes with the yard, and then we sit down for a wonderful summer-y meal, all washed down with a small pour of chilled Sauvignon Blanc.

I do leg and arm machines and end the session with a few partner ab exercises. We consider stopping by a nearby bar to say hi to a friend who picked up a shift there tonight, but instead go to Albertsons, where M. gets a six-pack of PBR and I get birthday cake Halo Top.

I can't remember the last time we all slept in like this \u2014 I guess we needed it. It's a rainy morning, so we skip the dog park and play for a bit inside instead. I make whole wheat pancakes and M. makes coffee, and we eat the pancakes smothered in peanut butter, vanilla Siggi's, and syrup. Then we get the dog ready to go to a nearby greenhouse, where we load up on garden essentials. It's packed today, since everyone is starting planting season. We get a variety of lettuces, kale, arugula, chard, brussels sprouts, broccoli, chives, and oregano. I also get 15 cubic feet of organic raised bed soil. We had a gift card to this greenhouse, but we can't locate it, so we have no choice but to pay ourselves. I pay, since it will be primarily my project.  $97.98 Advertisement 12:30 p.m. \u2014 I spend a few hours putting together our new raised plant bed to go along with our existing one (the directions are SO complicated, and it takes me much longer than expected) while M. cleans the grill. I divide the soil between the two beds, adding organic fertilizer that I have leftover from last year. I see a big storm cloud overhead, so I quickly do the planting. Soon it's pouring and I'm hungry, so I heat up leftover steak and mashed potatoes, and mix together a salad. M. and I had an argument during the gardening process and I'm still a little salty, so I eat alone at the table and then head to the bedroom to read for a while. After a few minutes, I start dozing, and then wake up to sunny skies. I grab gardening tools and a few packages of seeds and take the dog to the front yard to plant a variety of edible flowers, poppies, and Black-eyed Susans. When I get back inside, M. is ready to talk about our argument. We make up and then cuddle with the puppy on the couch for a bit. 4 p.m. \u2014 Both M. and I have scheduled runs today, and luckily the rain hasn't been as aggressive as the forecast promised. I get into running clothes and make my way to the Greenbelt (a bike/pedestrian path that winds along the river) for my six-mile run. It's a bit painful, but I get through it with help from Anna Faris's  Unqualified  podcast! When I get back, I play with the dog for a while until M. returns and we discuss dinner. We're both too exhausted (he ran almost 12 miles) to cook, so we pre-order a pizza from a place downtown and invite our friend/tenant to join us. When we get there, she buys beers and we pay for the pizza. It's so greasy and perfect.  $16 Advertisement 9 p.m. \u2014 Our friend informs us that it's National Beer Day, so we figure it's a good excuse to check out a new bicycle-themed taproom downtown. We quickly stop home to pick up our dogs and then make our way to the bar where we each buy our own beers. I drink a Hefeweizen while we socialize our dogs. Then we go back home and our friend comes to our house with her dog and a six-pack. The three of us end the evening playing that game called Heads Up! that Ellen Degeneres plays on her show.

We all lazily get up, M. and I get dressed, and we drive to the dog park. It's more crowded today than I've ever seen it \u2014 there are probably more than 50 dogs there, all chasing each other, pooping, and running after toys. Our dog is pretty focused on his ball, so we toss it to him, chat with a few other dog owners, and leave by 10, which is when the off-leash time ends.

After we eat, we fill up the bathtub for the pup's bath time. He hates it, but is cooperative anyway. While he runs around trying to get dry, we clean the bathroom and get ready to head out to go shopping. 11:30 a.m. \u2014 We drive to the Pendleton outlet to see what kind of bath towels they have in stock. M. recently visited his sister's house and raved about the Pendleton towels they have, but they're too expensive online. The outlet only has one style in stock and they're still $40, so we decide to pass. We stop by the Eddie Bauer outlet where we each buy something from their 50% off sale \u2014 M. gets a running shirt and I snag a windbreaker.  $26.50 12:30 p.m. \u2014 Our fridge is looking a bit sparse, so we go to WinCo to pick up a few groceries. I prefer Trader Joe's, but WinCo has an amazing bulk section, so it's our store of choice today. We get milk, eggs, carrots, bananas, apples, clementines, cilantro, an onion, potatoes, brussels sprouts, coffee beans, bulk curry powder and turmeric, cheese sticks, turkey lunch meat, Tillamook yogurts, salsa, and protein bars. On the way out, we each get a Shasta soda from the vending machine. M. pays, and I Venmo him for half.  $26.35 3:30 p.m. \u2014 Lunch was apple slices and cheddar with a piece of toast and TJ's Everything But The Bagel seasoning. After eating, I clean my car (I love my dog, but I can't stand dog hair) before falling asleep on the couch with M. \u2014 I blame too much sleep\u2026it always makes me more tired! I read my book for a bit, and then we take the dog for a walk around the neighborhood. A.k.a. my time to snoop on other people's gardens. Advertisement 5 p.m. \u2014 I get dressed for my final run of the week. I'm scheduled to do another six miles, but I settle on five with a decent incline. I try a new gradual uphill trail and I feel it big time in my quads! I thought the way down would be a breeze, but I get a stomach cramp, and it's not as easy as I thought it would be. The beautiful view of Boise at dusk distracts me a bit. After the five miles, I've done 21.6 of the 25 miles I was planning to do this week, which I consider sufficient. 7 p.m. \u2014 M. has dinner just about ready, but there's something wrong with the grill, so I help him transfer things to the oven. We have roasted brussels sprouts, grilled and baked steelhead trout, and leftover mashed potatoes, washed down with cheap Trader Joe's red wine. It's really hitting the spot. We watch a climbing group's documentary about their trip to Myanmar and then I watch  This Is Us  before passing out at 11. Daily Total: $52.85", "day_six": "Day Six: 7:30 a.m. \u2014 Solo parenting the dog again this morning, since M. has an early meeting downtown. At the dog park, there are four other dogs chasing the ball I throw and my poor babe hardly gets a turn at the action. Back at home, I make instant oats with peanut butter and agave, grab coffee that M. made, and head to the office. I got paid today, so I pay a few bills and pay an extra $100 towards my credit card bill, bringing it down to zero. Now all my debt is consolidated in my line of credit, which has been surprisingly great for my credit score. Advertisement 11:30 a.m. \u2014 Work is slower than usual today, which is good, because I'm about to log off for a few hours. About once or twice a month (if I'm not on a work trip), I volunteer at the women's prison in their education department. I did similar volunteer work during college, so I was excited to find a way to continue it here in Idaho. On my 30-minute drive to the prison I eat a cheese stick, apple, and a Clif Bar and listen to the podcast  Run, Selfie, Repeat.  This episode really hits home, as she talks about how hard it is to do things you're not good at and work your ass off anyway. This is something I'm working on! 2 p.m. \u2014 I help with two classes at the prison today, both in re-entry. Today we work on r\u00e9sum\u00e9 writing and how to disclose your criminal history to an employer, and take a touch typing test. The women in both class sections are wonderful and bounce great ideas off of each other. 3 p.m. \u2014 I log back onto my computer once I get home and respond to a few emails I missed while away. After I've reviewed most items, I heat up more chicken chili and eat at my desk, simultaneously engaging with my dog via pull toy. Eventually I wrap up work and change for the hill repeats on my training schedule. I ask M. to come along and we take the dog to the foothills, choose a manageable-looking hill, and then M. keeps time as I do a variety of distances and paces. I'm pooped at the end. Advertisement 6:30 p.m. \u2014 I have an hour to kill before another Kegfit class, so I eat a banana cinnamon Siggi's and make dinner. I cut up chicken breast and potatoes and throw them into the Instant Pot along with curry, turmeric, cayenne, and a variety of other spices. Instant Pots are magic and the curry is ready in less than 10 minutes. M. eats while I get ready to go. 9 p.m. \u2014 Kegfit was, once again, so amazing. It was a lot of leg work, which was brutal after my hills, but I have a great time socializing with the other members over a beer at the end. I decide to buy six classes for a $36 deal, which seems like a crazy bargain to me! Back at home, I heat up curry and TJ's garlic naan, eat on the couch while watching  Barry  with Bill Hader, and eventually fall asleep.  $36 Daily Total: $36", "day_seven": "Day Seven: 7:15 a.m. \u2014 Wake up to a work crisis, which is the worst way to start the day! I do a little damage control and then toss on leggings and boots and head to the dog park. When we get back, I make scrambled eggs with cheese, toast, and pourover coffee, and M. helps me water all of the plants I put in this weekend. I start my workday at the kitchen table, but later move to the office where I have fewer distractions. I consider working at my coworking space downtown, but there's nice lighting in the office right now and I'm not loving the idea of changing out of my leggings. M. eventually joins me at his desk and I turn on a classical Spotify playlist. I come up for air/ bathroom breaks a few times, but otherwise am totally in the zone for the morning. I take a break to eat an apple, too. Advertisement 12:45 p.m. \u2014 Lunchtime! M. takes the dog for a run and I heat up frozen white bean chicken chili that my mom made during her recent visit. I top it with plain yogurt, cilantro, and cheese. 2:30 p.m. \u2014 I really need a break. It's a gorgeous day, so I convince M. to take a walk with me and we somehow (I totally planned it) end up at a gas station where I buy him a fountain soda and one of those gas station slushies for me. I always want the biggest size and end up drinking a quarter of it before feeling sick.  $3.80 5 p.m. \u2014 Work was absolutely draining today. I do a core workout that M. calls \u201cKiller Core\u201d and then FaceTime with my cousin where we talk about how directionless we feel in our careers. At least I'm not alone! I make a pizza with a Trader Joe's whole wheat crust and top it with loads of arugula. M. and I devour the entire thing. For the rest of the night, I bum around on the couch waiting for Netflix to load, take the dog for a walk, and then somehow it's 10:30 and I'm ready for bed!

I feed the dog and take him out, brush my teeth, chug water, then change into yoga clothes and do a 20-minute Yoga With Adriene video. I love her, and the session makes my stiff knees feel a million times better. 8:45 a.m. \u2014 I go downstairs to make breakfast and see that my boyfriend, S.*, is back from his weekly grocery/bakery/Starbucks run. We have different eating habits, so we shop separately most of the time. He got me a scone at the bakery but I decide to save it for later in favor of my usual oats, almond butter, fruit, hemp seeds, pumpkin seeds, and cinnamon combination. I also boil some water for tea. I spent way too much money on tea recently and am slowly working my way through my stash before allowing myself to buy any more. I am a tea fiend! S. and I watch a few episodes of  Comedians In Cars Getting Coffee  on Netflix while I eat. 10:45 a.m. \u2014 It's time for me to leave for my biweekly therapy appointment. I really like my therapist and am so relieved to have finally found a good fit. Therapy, yoga, and a small dosage of medication really help to keep my once-debilitating anxiety and depression at bay. I am thrilled to find out I have a small copay today as I've just met my deductible for the year!  $10 Advertisement 12 p.m. \u2014 I arrive back home to find the house empty. S. and his dad have gone to Home Depot to get more supplies for the sliding barn door they're trying to install in our dining room. I decide to eat my bakery scone, which does nothing for my hunger, so I preheat the oven for a frozen pizza. S.'s sister got us a Blue Apron gift card for Christmas, and the shipment arrived while I was at therapy but I'm saving it for dinners later in the week. While the oven is preheating, I make sure to cancel my Blue Apron membership because mama can't afford this stuff every week! 12:45 p.m. \u2014 Pizza is done and S. and his dad are back. I take my food upstairs to keep the dog company so he doesn't get in the way while they work. I catch up on a few episodes of  This Is Us . 3:30 p.m. \u2014 It's time to leave to grab my friend to go see  Phantom Thread . She's already seen it but wants to see it again. We both use our Movie Passes. I buy a small root beer at the concession stand.  $4.50 6:15 p.m. \u2014 Movie was amazing but twisted! My friend feels like eating pancakes, so we decide to go to Bob Evans for brinner. I get two pancakes, scrambled eggs, and bacon, and it hits the spot. We catch up on life and really enjoy ourselves despite the snail-paced service.  $8.83 Advertisement 7:45 p.m. \u2014 I drop off my friend and spend the short drive home soaking up more of my audiobook:  The Incorrigible Children of Ashton Place . I'm on the last chapter and have thoroughly loved it. I make a mental note to grab the next volume in the series at work on Monday. 8 p.m. \u2014 I am back home and take the dog out for one last relief before locking up for the night. S. and I sit on the couch for a bit and I fill him in on the movie. I start getting a headache (and then realize I haven't had a single vegetable today, whoops) and we decide to head to bed. I wash my face, moisturize, brush my teeth, and pass out. Daily Total: $23.33", "day_two": "Day Two: 8 a.m. \u2014 This just seems to be the time my body wakes up when I don't have to set an alarm. I feed and let out the dog and realize I'm too hungry to do yoga, so I save that for later and make my oats. 9 a.m. \u2014 S. and I decide to put off our Sunday responsibilities and go to the coffee shop where my sister works to hang out for a little bit. We used to go every Sunday, but the holidays and my work schedule made things wonky. Unfortunately, his car won't start and it's blocking mine in, so we go back inside to wait for AAA. I throw a load of laundry in the washer and sit down to write my grocery list for the week. 9:45 a.m. \u2014 AAA arrives and thinks something is wrong with the starter, so they leave for other jobs and say they'll be back to tow it to the shop in about an hour. I make kukicha (Japanese twig tea) that sort of tastes like coffee since we probably won't make it to the coffee shop today. I remember I have a mileage reimbursement check from work (only $10.97, but every penny helps), so I deposit that using my bank app. 10:15 a.m. \u2014 I finally decide to just make easy burrito bowls this week since I have a bunch of pinto beans taking up space in the pantry. I take out the beans to soak and finish up my grocery list. I'm feeling antsy, so I wipe down the bathroom, my yoga mat, and a few other surfaces around the house. 10:45 a.m. \u2014 The tow truck is here! Our driveway is very narrow and I anxiously watch it pull in while the dog goes nuts barking. It takes about 15 minutes for them to figure out how to get the car on the truck (is that normal??), but they finally do it and are off to the shop. Since it's Sunday, they don't have any mechanics in today, so the car won't even be looked at until tomorrow morning. Luckily, my boyfriend can easily work from home. 11:30 a.m. \u2014 We head out to Trader Joe's. S. grabs a frozen pizza and green tea mochi while I stock up for the week: vegetable broth, frozen strawberries, jalape\u00f1os, diced green chilies, salsa, dates, oranges, oats, spinach, avocados, GoMacro bars, eggs, and cheese, plus a big bottle of ale as consolation for S.'s car situation.  $55.78 12:30 p.m. \u2014 Back home, I unload the groceries and decide to make one of our Blue Apron meals while the ingredients are still fresh. I choose the one that will take the most time: sweet potato and mushroom bao with hoisin mayo and cabbage slaw. It is more labor intensive than I tend to like when cooking, but it turns out pretty well and even S., who is not a fan of mushrooms, likes it. I don't feel like doing the dishes after all that cooking, so I just throw them in the sink to deal with later. 2:15 p.m. \u2014 S. and I are antsy and decide to venture out to the adult toy store to get a toy we'd been thinking about for awhile. We find it pretty easily, he pays for it, and we go back home to test it out. Success ;-) 4 p.m. \u2014 I realize the pinto beans have been soaking for longer than I meant them to, so I dump them in my Instant Pot with half a chopped onion, garlic, and a jalape\u00f1o. I finally deal with the dishes, fold the load of laundry I put in this morning, and wash off my makeup brushes. Then I go online and look for a new garlic press because mine is complete crap. I end up getting one through a coworker's Pampered Chef site. It's more than I thought I would spend, but she's had hers for years so I hope I'm making a good investment.  $28 4:45 p.m. \u2014 While waiting for the beans to cook, I watch the most recent episode of  This Is Us . Those last five minutes...woof. 6 p.m. \u2014 It's dinnertime for doggo. He finishes his meal in 30 seconds flat and I head upstairs to do a 40-minute yoga video. Ahhhhh. 6:45 p.m. \u2014 The beans are done, and I whiz them with an immersion blender until they're smooth. I decide to save the burrito bowls for Tuesday's lunch, as I need to make another Blue Apron meal that I'll have the rest of tomorrow. This one (pesto and goat cheese fusilli with chard) is much less time-intensive and much more my speed. It's delicious! 7:30 p.m. \u2014 After I clean up the kitchen and take out the dog, S. and I watch a few episodes of  Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee  and the first episode of  GLOW , which we've been meaning to watch for awhile. 9:10 p.m. \u2014 We're both tired, and I have to get up a little earlier tomorrow to shower. A new construction project is starting on my route to work, so I also have to make sure I leave enough time for any delays that might cause. I wash my face, moisturize, and brush my teeth. S. and I chat until we both fall asleep around 10. Daily Total: $83.78", "day_three": "Day Three: 5:30 a.m. \u2014 My alarm goes off and I hit snooze several times. 6 a.m. \u2014 I finally drag myself out of bed and downstairs to feed and take out the dog. Back inside, I jump in the shower, brush my teeth, moisturize, dry my hair, and get dressed. While I put on my makeup and straighten my hair, I listen to NPR's  Up First  to catch up on headlines. 6:50 a.m. \u2014 After making the bed, I head downstairs to make a slight variation of my standard oats. This morning's version features cacao powder, which was an excellent choice. Tea brews in my travel mug while I eat. I grab an orange, leftover pasta, and a GoMacro bar and am out the door at 7:25, ten minutes later than I planned to leave. It turns out to be fine, though, because it looks like construction hasn't even started and I have time to get gas before I get to work.  $20.17 8:20 a.m. \u2014 I arrive at work, put my lunch in the fridge, turn on the kids' computers and iPad, and settle in at my desk to catch up on emails and print out more coloring pages. The other children's librarian arrives and we dive into working on a grant proposal that's due next week. 12 p.m. \u2014 Lunchtime! It was a slow morning patron-wise, but it went by quickly because we were able to get a lot of work on the grant done. I go upstairs to our staff room and heat up my pasta. I spend the hour eating, reading, and catching up with S. via text. I also buy two boxes of Samoas from a coworker's daughter who's selling Girl Scout cookies. I bought Thin Mints and Tagalongs from our neighbor last week and can't believe I forgot to get Samoas! Payment isn't due until they come in March. 4:30 p.m. \u2014 Time to go home! I grab the next  Incorrigible Children  audiobook as well as another new book I want to read and head out to my car, which is covered in snow. Nothing a quick scrape won't fix. Traffic is a little slower than usual and I arrive home just after 5:30, in time to take S. to the shop to pick up his car. They didn't find anything wrong with it, but they did replace a recalled airbag, and he doesn't have to pay for anything. 6:05 p.m. \u2014 By the time I get home, I'm pretty hungry and it's clear that yoga is going to have to wait. I start on my final Blue Apron meal (spicy black bean enchiladas), as well as quinoa to add to my burrito bowls this week. As I'm dicing an onion, the knife slips and gives me a pretty nasty cut on my index finger. I run upstairs to grab a bandage, cursing my carelessness. 6:45 p.m. \u2014 I discover Blue Apron has forgotten to include the tortillas for the enchiladas, so I improvise and decide to make nachos instead. I don't usually drink on weeknights, but I think a glass of wine is in order. S. opens a bottle of cabernet and gives me a generous pour. I sip it as I finish cooking the food. 7:05 p.m. \u2014 Nachos and quinoa are done, and both turned out pretty well! At this point I'm too lazy to put the nachos on a plate, so I stand at the stove and eat them straight from the baking sheet. No shame. 7:45 p.m. \u2014 The kitchen is clean and it is time to veg. No yoga for me tonight, although I'll probably regret it tomorrow. S. and I watch two episodes of  GLOW . 9:15 p.m. \u2014 We get ready for bed and say maybe two sentences to each other before we're both out.

No matter how early I go to sleep, it's always hard to leave my cocoon! I feed and let out the dog, brush my teeth, moisturize, get dressed, and do my makeup and hair while listening to  Up First . 7:05 a.m. \u2014 I head downstairs to make breakfast and tea (same as yesterday) and assemble a burrito bowl for lunch: beans, quinoa, shredded cheese, spinach, and avocado. S. is back at work today, so the dog needs to be crated. I bribe him with a treat and head out the door. It snowed a few inches overnight and traffic is moving slowly, but the roads aren't too bad. I notice a sign saying the construction project has been moved to next week \u2013 construction around here never starts or finishes on time! 8:32 a.m. \u2014 I arrive at work a few minutes late. I've got an hour before we open and I use this time to do last minute prep for this morning's preschool story time. (I do story time and a craft once a week.) 12:15 p.m. \u2014 I am extra hungry after my larger-than-usual story time crowd this morning. I love doing story time and it made me so happy to see my regulars as well as new faces today. My burrito bowl is delicious and I spend my lunch hour reading. 4:30 p.m. \u2014 Time to go home! I eat a GoMacro bar and listen to my audiobook on the drive. 5:30 p.m. \u2014 I change into yoga clothes and do a 30-minute yoga video. Yoga usually leaves me feeling better, but tonight, certain poses make me feel anxious and nauseated. I make it through the entire video, but need to spend about 45 minutes calming down before I'm ready to eat, so I decide to call my mom. We text every day and talk on the phone about once a week. She only lives about 45 minutes away, but with our different work schedules, I only see her two or three times a month. We catch up and I start to get hungry for dinner. 6:45 p.m. \u2014 I reheat the leftover nachos and eat way too many while watching  The IT Crowd  with S. 8 p.m. \u2014 I have heartburn, ugh. I take out the dog, shower, dry my hair, brush my teeth, and get in bed. S. and I have a long chat about money, which we try to make a point of talking about regularly. I really enjoy my job but it's no secret that the pay isn't great. It's my first librarian job out of grad school and I feel like there's still so much for me to learn and do before I start looking elsewhere. We talk about areas where I can cut down my spending (ahem, groceries) and ways I can make extra money on the side. It's a tough conversation to have, but I'm glad we're able to do it. 9:30 p.m. \u2014 I read  Anne of Avonlea  until my eyes start to droop. I loved  Anne of Green Gables  as a kid but never got around to reading the other books, which is a shame, because Anne Shirley is one of my very favorite fictional characters!

Back inside, I start my usual routine of dressing, listening to the news, and doing my hair and makeup before heading downstairs for breakfast. 7:30 a.m. \u2014 I make the same breakfast and tea as yesterday and check my bank app. I see my federal tax refund has hit my account and I immediately transfer 90% of it to my debt. I keep the other 10% as a small cushion for my checking account until I get paid on Friday, at which point I'll transfer the rest to debt. 8 a.m. \u2014 Time to hit the road.  The Incorrigible Children of Ashton Place  once again keeps me company on my commute. 1:15 p.m. \u2014 I eat another burrito bowl and exchange cute animal videos with my coworkers. 5 p.m. \u2014 We close early on Wednesdays, so everyone leaves at 5. The extra half hour always seems so long! I've been feeling kind of off all day and can't wait to get home. First, I have to stop at Target to get bread and more B12 \u2013 I have been out of my supplements for a few weeks now and can definitely tell a difference in my overall energy levels. Maybe that's why I've felt weird all day. Luckily, I hate the way the Target near my house is laid out and so I'm rarely, if ever, tempted to get more than I need.  $19.85 6:20 p.m. \u2014 Back home and in need of a good stretch session and maybe deep breathing exercises. I forgo a video tonight and spend 20 minutes using my Calm app and doing whatever yoga poses I think will feel good. 6:45 p.m. \u2014 The only thing that sounds good to me for dinner is toast, so that's what I make, with a little bit of ghee. S. and I sit on the couch and catch up on our days, and I look over my budget for next month. 8 p.m. \u2014 We head upstairs to get ready for bed. I'm feeling wired and tired. S. and I talk some more before he goes to sleep, and I read for a long time to calm down my brain. Today wasn't my best day mental health-wise, but I've had way worse, and tomorrow is another day.

I check the weather and Instagram before getting out of bed. (I try not to do this most days, but clearly I don't always succeed.) I feed and take out the dog and then change into yoga clothes for a 20-minute video and 10 minutes of meditation. 8:30 a.m. \u2014 I feel so much better than yesterday and am really hungry, too! I realize I haven't seen my sister in awhile even though she lives just 15 minutes away. She's five years younger than I am, and while we fought a lot growing up, we get along really well now. I text her to see what she's up to, and she offers to come over to make me pancakes! I eat an orange to hold me over, then shower and get dressed. My sister arrives and gets started on the pancakes, and I make us tea. We catch up on each others' lives. 10:05 a.m. \u2014 The pancakes were delicious, and I'm so glad I got to see my sister. She leaves to get errands done before she heads into work this afternoon, and I go upstairs to dry my hair and finish getting ready. I decide I don't feel like listening to the news today and I jam out to Broadway tunes instead. 11 a.m. \u2014 I leave for work and fill up my tank on the way.  $23.42 12 p.m. \u2014 Once I arrive, I gather everything I need for my monthly outreach visit to one of the preschools in the area. I do story time at three preschools throughout the month, and today is my big one, where I do five 30-minute sessions in a row. 12:30 p.m. \u2014 I listen to the third  Incorrigible Children  audiobook on my way. 3 p.m. \u2014 I am exhausted, but that was fun! I head back to the library and work on a \u201csuperb owl\u201d display of owl books since the Super Bowl is this weekend, then take my lunch before the other children's librarian leaves for the day. 8 p.m. \u2014 Time to go home! I am so ready. 9 p.m. \u2014 I arrive at home to the news that the dog has gotten into S.'s hand cream, and I'm worried he may be sick later.

The dog seems back to normal and gobbles up his breakfast. I make eggs and toast and head out the door. 9 a.m. \u2014 I'm early to the doctor, so I read in the waiting room. It's just a med check, so it's a quick appointment. I've met my deductible for the year, so no copay. 9:30 a.m. \u2014 I head over to my mom's house, which is nearby, to let out her dogs and hopefully take a little nap before meeting my dad and stepmom for lunch later. I end up starting a new book ( The Truth as Told  by Mason Buttle) and read for almost two hours. 11:15 a.m. \u2014 I drive across town to my dad and stepmom's house, and we go to a nearby diner for lunch. I get a spinach omelet, fruit, an English muffin, and chamomile tea. My dad pays. 1:15 p.m. \u2014 Back home.

I spend a good chunk of the afternoon catching up with Sophia, Rose, Dorothy, and Blanche. 5:15 p.m. \u2014 S. and I meet a friend at the coffee shop where my sister works, and our drinks are free. 6 p.m. \u2014 We decide we're hungry, so we plan to meet back up at a tavern a few blocks away. It's freezing, so walking is not an option. Parking is awful in this part of town, but we find a spot for $5 - a steal on a Friday night.  $5 7:30 p.m. \u2014 Dinner was great! I got a chicken avocado BLT and a tasty beer. We all pay separately for our meals. On the way home we stop at Whole Foods to pick up cranberry juice and pills because I feel like I have a UTI coming on. Hemp seeds are on sale, so I also grab some of those.  $45.50 8 p.m. \u2014 Back home and ready to catch up on the sleep I lost last night. I read to wind down.

I try to get ready for the day as quickly as possible, though I have the tendency to waste time when I'm still drowsy in the morning. Despite the fact that it takes me only 15 minutes to shower and then force mascara onto my eyelashes, my morning routine is often slowed down by my feeding the cat, drinking water, staring into space, etc. I glance at the clock and rush to gather my things for work. 10 a.m. \u2014 I grab a coffee ($1) and pretend to work for two hours while waiting for Firefly Festival tickets to become available. Then I quickly work my way through the site to buy two tickets for my best friend and me ($299 each) and a tent for four ($290 per person). My friends and I decided to splurge on glamping so that we can get the festival experience but still be able to shower. My friends pay me back right away on Venmo for the festival ticket and most of the tent cost, but it feels weird to spend so much money on a concert happening five months from now!  $590 12 p.m. \u2014 I order lunch for the team today and put the catering on my card (triple points!), but will be reimbursed for the total. ($305 expensed) 3 p.m. \u2014 We have a call with our partner to discuss what my team has been working on over the past few weeks. I work in digital marketing, and my company partners with larger firms to handle their search and on-site strategy. I always appreciate the opportunity to give my team members credit in front of the partners. Advertisement 6 p.m. \u2014 I finally leave the office and rush home to reunite with my couch. My sister invites me out with some of her friends, but I don't have the energy. I don't think I'm in the mood to spend time with Trump supporters, which I know is probably petty and immature. Daily Total: $590", "day_two": "Day Two: 9:30 a.m. \u2014 I sleep in later than usual for a Saturday and play with my cat for a while. He's almost two but very much acts like a kitten with his clumsy pouncing. I never thought I would be a cat person but he's pretty perfect. 10:30 a.m. \u2014 I head to a workout with my sister. My mother recently got us a package of training session; we could never afford a personal trainer on our own, so I'll be sad when the training is over! We grab Starbucks after the workout to reward ourselves for being active.  $3.19 12:30 p.m. \u2014 I realize I haven't deep-cleaned my apartment in a while. The bathroom could use work, and since I'm already dirty from my workout, I dive into the tub with tile cleaner in hand. 2 p.m. \u2014 After I finish cleaning, I bath in my newly sparkling bathroom. I wander into the kitchen to make coffee and decide to be ambitious and make crepes. I've always enjoyed cooking and baking but I rarely have time for either. I stuff the crepes full of chocolate chips along with almond butter and jam. Advertisement 6 p.m. \u2014 All my spending yesterday coupled with my lack of motivation to be social tonight results in another weekend night on the couch. It was a stressful week at work, and I look forward to spending quality time with Netflix.

Working weekends is never fun, but it happens more often than not. 11 a.m. \u2014 I drink coffee and snack on paleo tea cookies while I work. I'm definitely not going paleo, but when I bake any kind of treat I try to make sure it has some nutritional value. 2 p.m. \u2014 I take a break from working to run to the grocery store. (I only have supplies for cookies right now, and those won't exactly get me through the week.) I stock up on frozen fruit, vegetables, plantain chips, coconut yogurt, ground chicken, and miscellaneous other items. I'm thinking I'll make buffalo chicken meatballs for dinner this week.  $111.48 3 p.m. \u2014 I keep working while I begin prepping my food for the week. I'm excited to start cooking again! I whip up black bean brownies (not good), chicken meatballs (good), and protein donuts for breakfast (healthy  and  delicious). Feeling like a productive health goddess, I polish off my tea cookies in celebration. 8 p.m. \u2014 I'm essentially done working for the remainder of the evening, so I peruse Amazon for any items I might need. Although I know I have the tendency to shop online out of boredom, I stock up on a few things for my upcoming trip to South America. I purchase a few necessities along with my SPF 110 facial sunscreen. I'm a firm believer in sunscreen and I take it a bit overboard when it comes to my face and neck.  $33.21 Advertisement 10 p.m. \u2014 I go to bed feeling relaxed and prepared for the week ahead. Then I remember that our performance reviews are this week, and I toss and turn all night. Daily Total: $144.69", "day_four": "Day Four: 7:20 a.m. \u2014 I snooze my alarm for no less than 45 minutes and wake up feeling groggy and annoyed at myself for oversleeping. I try to rush through my morning routine, but my cat wants snuggles and I'm in a giving mood. 8:30 a.m. \u2014 The drive to work takes about 45 minutes because my office is in South Carolina and I'm not a very aggressive driver. I hurry into the office to buy a coffee ($1) and check my schedule for the day.  $1 10 a.m. \u2014 I prepare for a team meeting regarding the week's priorities and think through my to do-list. It's shaping up to be a busy week, so it's important that I have a tangible task idea of how to keep my priorities in order. 11:30 a.m. \u2014 I walk out of a meeting with my manager feeling frustrated, so I try to focus my attention on the other meetings I have later this afternoon. I'm trying to be a more positive person at the office. 12:30 p.m. \u2014 A coworker and I grab lunch in the caf\u00e9 and work on our personal reviews. The review cycle is an awkward and stressful process, and I've never been comfortable with the idea of anonymous feedback.  $2.50 7 p.m. \u2014 The remainder of the day flies by, and I walk out with a few friends from work. They invite me out to dinner but since I just spent a ton of money on groceries, we decide to eat in. They join me at my place and we eat and work on our annual reviews. I struggle through my self-assessment and realize I need to keep a list of what I accomplish throughout the year. Advertisement 10 p.m. \u2014 I lovingly kick everyone out of my apartment and put on  Bob's Burgers  before bed. It's my favorite show to fall asleep to and lulls me to sleep. Daily Total: $3.50", "day_five": "Day Five: 7:20 a.m. \u2014 Wake up relatively late again and rush to work. I have a lot to get done today and probably should have gotten to the office earlier than usual. Once I'm in, I grab my coffee from the caf\u00e9 and get to work.  $1 10:45 a.m. \u2014 It's my coworker's birthday, so I pregame lunch with a donut. I'm not hungry yet, but after a packed morning of meetings and a slew of demanding emails, the donut really hits the spot. 12:30 p.m. \u2014 I head upstairs to grab lunch at the caf\u00e9 before my afternoon block of meetings. I decide to treat myself to sushi and a bag of popcorn ($4.50). The sushi is fairly hit or miss \u2013 and today's is a miss. I toss half of it and run to my next meeting.  $4.50 4 p.m. \u2014 Because of all my meetings today, I have trouble fitting in any time to do real work. My longer-term projects need attention, and I put off a few requests from my manager. I grab a banana with peanut butter and a seltzer and get to work.  $1.50 7 p.m. \u2014 I stop for gas on my way home from work ($25.41) and swing by CVS to pick up hair dye ($10.71). I had horrible luck at a salon last month, and the root area of my hair is becoming weirdly orange. I grab an ash brown color and hope for the best.  $36.12 Advertisement 8:30 p.m. \u2014 The dye essentially makes no difference except that I think my roots look even lighter. I don't have the energy to care enough to fix it tonight, so I trim the ends and deep condition to feel marginally better about the unnecessary damage I just caused. Daily Total: $43.12", "day_six": "Day Six: 7:30 a.m. \u2014 SNOW DAY! Charlotte rarely gets snow and the city is not prepared with enough salt trucks or snow plows. The roads get pretty icy and three inches of snow can actually debilitate the city. With that in mind, I decide to work from home. 9 a.m. \u2014 I make a big pot of coffee and eat a leftover crepe with almond butter and jam from the weekend. I feel full but continue to eat whatever snacks I can find throughout the morning. 12 p.m. \u2014 Work was insane this morning since most people either didn't show up to the office or are leaving early. Most of the problem-solving is up to me, so this snow day is shaping up to be very busy. 6 p.m. \u2014 My training session is canceled due to the weather tonight, which is a bummer because I missed the last session too. Feeling lethargic and lazy, I head downstairs to the gym for a quick run. I'm not much of a runner, but I have pipe dreams of becoming someone who wakes up to run before work each morning. An evening on the elliptical for 30 minutes is close enough for now. Advertisement 7 p.m. \u2014 I throw a load of laundry into the washer while I heat up dinner and open a bottle of wine. One of the perks of living in Charlotte is that almost all apartment complexes come with an in-unit washer and dryer. This is definitely something I could have used when I worked in New York, and I'm sure I will miss it whenever I leave Charlotte. 8:30 p.m. \u2014 I need to purchase my flights for my brother's fianc\u00e9e's bachelorette party. I'm really excited to visit New Orleans for the first time. Party, here I come!  $316 9:30 p.m. \u2014 Exhausted from sitting on the couch all day, I drag my lazy body to bed. The few inches of snow really make the courtyard outside my window look beautiful.

I pack my protein donut and the remains of my chicken meatballs in my bag before I leave. 8 a.m. \u2014 I grab a coffee from the caf\u00e9 and finish up some of the reports I didn't get around to yesterday. My day is pretty light on meetings and I'm excited to spend some time doing legitimate work.  $1 12 p.m. \u2014 Since I packed my lunch today, I have no real need to go to the caf\u00e9, but I can use the walk and a seltzer. I grab two and take my time getting back to my desk. I expected a more dramatic day today after the snow day, but it's shaping up to be pretty calm.  $1 Advertisement 3 p.m. \u2014 I present the progress my team has made this month to the broader marketing team, and everyone seems excited about what we have in the works. We have lofty goals but I feel confident that we can hit and exceed them. I walk back to my desk, proud of my team and eager to get to work. 6 p.m. \u2014 I'm dog-sitting this weekend and tonight is the first night! I'm staying at the owner's house, so I head straight there after work to let the dogs outside. I've always wanted to own a dog but they're high maintenance and expensive to board. With all the traveling I do, it just doesn't make sense for me to adopt one right now. Luckily, I have my very low-maintenance cat.

My alarm clock known as my four-month-old baby slept in a bit. (She usually wakes around 6 to eat.) I get up and warm her bottle, feed her, and change her. After she eats I can usually count on her going back to sleep until we leave for the day, but today there is no mini nap. I quickly get dressed and we head out the door. I drop her at Grandma's house. (I pay my sister-in-law monthly to watch her three days a week \u2013 I am so lucky!) I head to work, late as usual. 9 a.m. \u2014 I sneak into the office, drop off my stuff and walk down to the coffee shop on the corner. I oversee a very small staff of people who are are great at their jobs and therefore do not need micromanagement, which I love. By the time I get into the office, our clients are in group and things are running smoothly. I order a decaf coffee (I'm breastfeeding so I limit my caffeine intake, but I love my coffee) and a breakfast croissant with ham, cheese, red onion, and tomato. So good.  $9.44 1 p.m. \u2014 It's been a typical Monday \u2013 small fires and chaos and whatnot. I take a moment to text my sister-in-law asking for a picture of my babe! She loves her aunt and every picture is always a smiley one, unless she's hangry. I miss her so much but I also love the freedom of my job. It's a good balance: I get enough time to be a decisive and articulate individual and then get to go home and be a silly mommy and wife. I am getting pretty hangry myself and I don't want to spend any more money at the coffee shop today.

We gossip about other coworkers, which is a horrible habit of mine. I have coupon from Express for $10 off, so I order a pair of black flats. I have a capsule work wardrobe, meaning three pairs of pants and five shirts to pair them with, but I am missing plain black flats. My kid has twice the amount of clothes as I do, but it makes my morning routine simple. I save money and I know I look professional daily.  $26.27 12 p.m. \u2014 Sweet! I got a free lunch today. My coworker is a great cook but hates eating her leftovers, so she often gives them to me. Today it's homemade spaghetti, which I love.

On tonight's menu is Trader Joe's Mandarin Orange Chicken and Vegetable Fried Rice with a side of squash. We eat out twice a week for dinner, usually on Friday and Saturday nights. The other nights I make really simple meals. My husband is a teacher and is studying for his master's as well as pursuing amateur boxing, so if I want to see him, dinner needs to take 20 minutes or less. We get the babe bathed, fed, and down for bed by 9 p.m. I pump for 30 minutes and then snuggle with my husband while watching wrestling on WWE. Great way to decompress. We have a 10:30 sharp bedtime.

I went for toothpaste and of course ended up spending 200 bucks. I purchased an activity center for my babe; she has been super clingy lately and I am hoping this will entertain her just long enough for me to get some chores done. I also purchased a new shower curtain and bath mats for my grandpa's house, a birthday card and glove-and-beanie matching set for my two-year-old cousin, toothpaste, Listerine, Fixodent (for Grandpa), and this new matte lipstick I saw a commercial for.

(At this point you might have realized that I'm kind of boring.)  $5.70 8 p.m. \u2014 Still at work, but am getting hungry for dinner. I'm too lazy to walk to any food places out of the office, so I opt for a salad from the salad vending machine (yes, there is such a thing!) at work. I quite like the salads \u2013 they are very customizable and replaced daily. I'm getting one with quinoa, spinach, corn, tomatoes, raisins, cheddar cheese, pine nuts, and chicken breast, plus lemon-pepper dressing to go with it.  $4.90 9 p.m. \u2014 I steal a pack of Oreos from our team's snack table. Not really hungry, just stress-eating! 10:50 p.m. \u2014 I am so fatigued that I don't think I can carry on working. I might be the last person in the office. I finally call a cab and head home. I have some Kettle chips, shower, and get ready for bed.

I check my Fitbit and apparently only got around five hours of sleep last night, so I anticipate that today will be rough. 8 a.m. \u2014 For breakfast I have a glass of chocolate pistachio milk again. 8:45 a.m. \u2014 There was a train disruption, so I arrive at work later that expected. Can't be bothered to make my own brew today, so I have a cup of office coffee. I check my emails and remember that I have to get a senior colleague to sign my application form for the Young Engineer of the Year award that our Marketing department persuaded me to apply to. I feel like I don't fit the bill, but hey, I'll try my luck! I'll find out next month if I get shortlisted. 12:45 p.m. \u2014 I am meeting a university friend for lunch who I haven't seen in a while. I suggest a poke place near my work, and we each have spicy salmon poke with broccoli. She insists on paying when the bill comes, so I treat her to coffee at a nearby joint afterwards. I get myself a decaf latte (I need sleep tonight), and she orders a skinny flat white. It's always fun to catch up with old friends and find out what they are up to now!  $8.50 1:45 p.m. \u2014 A colleague offers me a Swiss roll slice.

It is raining outside and my laptop has run out of battery, so I go home instead of back to the office. A project manager from the client side offers some of us a ride. I thank him and ask to be dropped at a mall near my place so that I can get dinner. 9:45 p.m. \u2014 Only fast food chains are open at this hour. I was considering getting KFC for dinner, but I see that they don't sell the Spicy Sichuan Special anymore! I go to 7-Eleven instead and get a microwave-ready kimchi fried rice. I guess this will do.  $3.40 10 p.m. \u2014 Walk home to my place and my pants and shoes get soaked in the rain.

I've only just noticed how strong the office coffee is, as I instantly feel like an Energizer Bunny after I finish my cup. Ready to crack my brain for another challenging day. Advertisement 12:30 p.m. \u2014 Lunch is another vegetarian wrap that I eat quietly at my desk. I received a reimbursement check of $300 from my insurance company yesterday, so I use my lunchtime to deposit it at my bank's check deposit box.  $5.70 9 p.m. \u2014 After a long day of work, I am considering either staying even later at the office or instead going to get an additional birthday present for my BF. Most shops in Singapore close at 10, so if I leave now, I'll be able to make it. My BF and I normally extra-spoil each other on birthdays, so I have quite a generous annual gift budget. He wants a bean bag chair from Muji, so I head over there. My BF texts to ask if I have already left work and if he can stay over. I tell him \"no\" so that I can keep the gift hidden from him! 9:30 p.m. \u2014 The bean bag is out of stock! And I'm told that it won't be back in stores for a while. I'm afraid I won't have any presents for my BF to open on his actual birthday because the manga won't be there in time. Panicked, I head to the nearby Crate and Barrel to see if they sell any bean bags, but they don't. I give up and head home. I should have done my gift shopping earlier! 10 p.m. \u2014 I text my BF that he can still come over if he wants to. I go to 7-Eleven again and pick up a microwave-ready black pepper chicken leg and a pack of ready-to-eat onsen eggs.  $4.70 Advertisement 10:30 p.m. \u2014 BF arrives at my place. I feel too guilty about the birthday present thing and tell him that I won't have presents for him in time for his actual birthday.

Apparently I have enough stamps on my loyalty card (not that hard if you get the same thing from the same place almost every day), so I only have to pay $0.50 for my lunch today. Small win!  $0.50 8 p.m. \u2014 Leave work today after sending important emails. I was planning to stay later to finish more work, but my BF texted to say that he might have to work tomorrow (since he has to travel to Hong Kong next week for a conference) and I want to see him. I decide that I will continue my work tomorrow instead. Today is the earliest that I am leaving work in a while, which I take as a win! 8:30 p.m. \u2014 I thought I'd try to look for the bean bag at another Muji store a few MRT stops away just to try my luck, but of course they don't have any in stock there either, so I reluctantly put my name on a waitlist. I tell them that I might change my mind if the item arrives too late and ask if they can hold payment until collection date. They agree!

Then I text some friends and my housemates to invite them to my BF's birthday celebration. 9 p.m. \u2014 On my way home, I pick up a spicy barramundi miso jjigae soup with bread from a nearby spot. I have enough reward points on my member card to redeem a free soup, so dinner is free! I live for days like this \u2013 an almost free lunch and a free dinner! 1 a.m. \u2014 I stay up late doing dances in my room to hit my daily steps goal. My insurance has a program where if you hit a certain amount of steps within a week, you can get a voucher for $7.60 that you can use at a supermarket chain or Starbucks or as credit on Uber. I'm still not close to my weekly target so far, so I try to get in as many steps as I can tonight. I'm not going to lose that sweet $7.60!

Total comes out to be $4.40 but my voucher covers most of it.  $0.60 4:30 p.m. \u2014 I order a chocolate cake from a local artisanal chocolate specialist in the same mall that I will pick up and pay for tomorrow. 5 p.m. \u2014 I plan to get giant number balloons for tomorrow, but the shop assistant advises me to get them a few hours before the event to make sure they're at maximum perkiness. They're $18.20 each, so the total will be $36.40 for two.

I have grapes as a snack to ward off hunger until then. Advertisement 8:45 p.m. \u2014 BF finally texts that he will be leaving work soon! My housemate joins us and we order chicken rice. Dinner is BF's treat for me, so my housemate settles the dinner monies with him. 9:30 p.m. \u2014 We finally get to eat, thank goodness!

One of my housemates sneakily requests to pause the movie by excusing himself to get drinks in the kitchen. I quickly excuse myself to the kitchen as well to prepare the cake and candles. Another housemate turns all the lights off and I emerge from the kitchen with the cake! Everyone sings and my BF smiles from ear to ear. We take photos, BF blows out the candle, and I serve the cake.

I run around doing an abbreviated version of my normal morning routine, which includes brushing my teeth, quickly pulling my hair up into a semi-nice bun, applying mascara and brow pencil, and throwing on a comfy shift dress because I know I'm in for a long day. 7:30 a.m. \u2014 I walk the dogs, grab the breakfast and lunch that I packed last night, and take out ground sausage from the freezer to defrost for dinner. While doing so, my roommate and best friend, L.*, talks me down from my panic. I have flexible hours, so it doesn't really matter if I'm late, as long as I work eight hours a day. I just hate being late. I run out the door to catch the 7:47 a.m. train. 8:30 a.m. \u2014 After a nerve-racking bus ride (I had to stand and I hate standing on the bus because I'm clumsy), I arrive at my desk 30 minutes later than usual. Not bad for waking up 45 minutes late. I settle in with my breakfast of yogurt and granola while I finish a project from yesterday. 10:45 a.m. \u2014 I'm not going to make it until lunch, so I grab two Cuties tangerines from my bag and take a Twitter break in between projects. 12 p.m. \u2014 Heat up my taco rice bowl, which consists of chicken, salsa, taco seasoning, black beans, corn, cheese, and rice. I make this for lunch quite a bit because it's quick and heats up nicely. It all cooks in one pan in about 30 minutes and I eat it with tortilla chips. Sometimes I add avocado in the morning if we have any, which is rare. Today I sit at my desk and work through lunch so I can still leave at a decent hour. Advertisement 2 p.m. \u2014 Struggling to keep my eyes open. I'm normally a morning person (this morning was weird for me since I normally wake before my alarm), so I start to struggle with my energy levels in the afternoon. I head to the kitchen with a tea bag from my desk and brew myself a cup of black chai, which I drink while snacking on chocolate-covered peanut butter pretzels from Trader Joe's. 4:29 p.m. \u2014 As I'm hovering over the punch-out button, a manager comes to my desk to show me how to do a new project that needs to be finished tomorrow. I dutifully follow her to her office. I know I'll be grateful for the work tomorrow, but now I'm a little annoyed to be missing my bus. 5:30 p.m. \u2014 Finally home, so I walk and feed the dogs. L. washes the dishes from last night so I take out the trash and get the mail while talking to my grandma, mom, and sister on the phone. Then I start cooking dinner: baked ziti, one of my favorite meals, which L. loves too. 6:15 p.m. \u2014 While dinner is in the oven, I have a beer and go through the mail. There's an invitation to my sorority anniversary gala next month. I knew this was coming and have been setting aside money for a couple months to help cover the costs. I fill out the RSVP right away and write a check to hold my spot.  $60 Advertisement 6:45 p.m. \u2014 L. and I read during dinner like the true grandmas we are, which then leads to us both reading in her bed, commenting out loud about funny things we come across in our books. I finish  The Assistants  by Camille Perri, which I really enjoyed even though it hit a little close to home (since I'm an assistant). 9:30 p.m. \u2014 Take very cranky dogs for a walk in the rain. I shower, staring longingly at my shampoo. I'm trying to stretch out the days in between washes because my hair is getting too greasy, too fast.

I play with him for 15 minutes while my older dog shoots us dirty looks from bed for waking her up. 6:15 a.m. \u2014 Both dogs are sleeping again, so I get ready. Once again, I pull my hair up into a semi-nice bun because it's too greasy to do anything else with. I wash my face, swipe on witch hazel toner, and apply mascara, brow pencil, and brow gel. I take the dogs for a quick walk, brew tea in a to-go mug, set two chicken breasts out to defrost for dinner, and say a quick good morning to L.

I eat yogurt with granola and two Cuties, because I'm a creature of habit when it comes to food for the week. 10:30 a.m. \u2014 Get a text from my mom that she needs the money for my phone bill by Friday. I decide to just send it to her now since I have the money and tomorrow is Pay Day. 12:30 p.m. \u2014 I take my lunch hour late today because I want to finish up what I'm working on before I eat. I have another taco rice bowl with chips and chocolate-covered peanut butter pretzels. When I get back to my desk, I order some things from Amazon: a pack of six picture frames for some travel posters I got while I was living in Australia, a pack of three iPhone chargers, and a small hammer. All of these things have been sitting in my cart for a while and I have extra money from budgeting my last paycheck so I decide to get them now.  $47.59 1:30 p.m. \u2014 I tackle a confusing billing problem and then the afternoon breezes by. Take a small break for my afternoon tea, of course. 4:20 p.m. \u2014 Sign out 10 minutes early, which means I can catch the earlier bus and train, getting me home in about half the time. I love when I can do that. 5 p.m. \u2014 I take a long walk with the dogs while talking to my grandma on the phone about her book club meeting today. I recommended the book they read for today, so she tells me about how the other grandmas in the club gushed about me. Makes me feel like an A+ granddaughter! L. normally does the dishes when she gets home in the evening since I cook for us, but she has to work late, so I do all the dishes, wipe down the counters, and get dinner started.

He got off much earlier than he thought and wants to take me to dinner, but since I already started cooking and have plans with L. later, I turn him down. I promise to call him before I go to bed, though. 7:30 p.m. \u2014 After dinner, L. and I take the train to the library, but once we get off we realize it's about to close. We go to Target instead, since it's conveniently at the same stop. I buy shampoo, conditioner, body wash, and nails to hang my new picture frames. I use my REDcard to get 5% off.  $15.56 9 p.m. \u2014 When I get home, I shower and actually wash my hair this time. I feel like a whole new woman. Then I put on a clay face mask, and while it dries I quickly tidy my room and bathroom. How does everything get so messy so fast? 10:30 p.m. \u2014 I walk the dogs and then get in bed to call D. He tells me he wants us to get more serious and wants to know if I will delete my Tinder (which is where we met). This sounds like a great idea to me. I tell him I deleted my Tinder shortly after our first date, which makes him really happy because he did the same thing. I fall asleep shortly after, feeling pretty content with my life.

It is still a struggle to get up when it rings again at 6:45. My pup doesn't seem to notice my lack of sleep and runs around my feet while I sleepily go through my morning routine. 7:15 a.m. \u2014 Take both dogs for a walk, set out chicken to defrost, grab my lunch, and head to the train. When I walk outside, the train is already at the station, five whole minutes early. I watch it leave as I wait to cross the busy street. The next train is of course running late so it takes me nearly double the normal time to get to work. On the bus, I send my friend my portion of the money for Spotify for the year. 8:30 a.m. \u2014 Eat breakfast (yogurt and Cuties) at my desk again while reading through emails. 9:30 a.m. \u2014 My boss is back in the office today. I'm the assistant to the VP, but he has never had an assistant before (and I've never been an assistant before) so we are still trying to figure out a good balance. Others in the department don't like to bring me extra work when he is in, meaning I have much less to do today. But I brought this up to him last month, so he's been trying to convince people to assign me things.

I set up a wellness checkup for later in the month, which will save me about 25% on my health insurance through work. 11 a.m. \u2014 Finally someone brings me a fascinating market trends project that I thoroughly enjoy chipping away at. Who knew I would like market trends. I sure didn't. 12:30 p.m. \u2014 Lunch is same as yesterday, but with Cheez-Its instead of pretzels. I eat at my desk again to make up for my lateness this morning. I miss sunlight. While I'm eating, L. texts me about a comedian coming to our area in March and wants to know if I want to go. I do, and offer to buy our tickets right now, only to realize that I don't have my wallet with me. I panic for a second before realizing it must be in my backpack from our Target trip yesterday. I'll have to buy the tickets later. 3 p.m. \u2014 Still have nothing to do. I make tea and settle in for some money management, since I got paid today. I have a system that sounds much more complex on paper then it does in real life. I have three accounts: my basic debit account, a debt account without a debit card attached, and a savings account. My direct deposit comes into my main debit account twice a month and when it does, I move all the money I've calculated that I need for bills into my second account. Then I move either $75 or $45 into my savings account (so I save a total of $120 a month). I pay all of my bills with my second debit account but I pay my daily expenses with the first account, so I know how much \u201cfun\u201d money I have to spend (\"fun\" meaning groceries, mainly). I like to keep them separate in my head. Today I move $495 into my second account and $75 into my savings account, since I already paid rent this month.

We decide we want to get dressed up and go out to a nearby bar with a fun crowd and live music. 8:45 p.m. \u2014 The band is amazing.

On the train back home, we make plans with another friend to meet at the mall for shopping and lunch. 11:30 a.m. \u2014 C. and I amuse ourselves by trying on the ugliest things Forever 21 has to offer while we wait for our friend. Then I actually find and buy a shirt I like, which is rare for me at Forever 21 ($11.90). We stop by Sephora, where I buy two clay face masks ($17.47), before we head to the food court for lunch. I get Chipotle ($8.65) while the others get Panda Express. After lunch, I buy new underwear from American Eagle ($31.67) and chocolate from See's Candy with a gift card ($12.50). We say goodbye to our friend, and then C. and I head to the movies. The only seats left are right in front of the screen, though, so we decide to go to the theater closer to my apartment.  $69.69 3:30 p.m. \u2014 On the drive back, I get hit with a massive headache, so as soon as we get home I abandon C. to sit in my dark room for a while. I end up falling asleep but wake up just before we need to leave for the movie, feeling much better. I walk the dogs and quickly feed them dinner  before we hope on the train. Advertisement 6:30 p.m. \u2014 C. buys my ticket, drink, and candy since I covered our drinks and breakfast. We see  Jumanji , which is much funnier than I thought it would be. 9 p.m. \u2014 On the way home, I run into Target to buy a hammer because the one I ordered from Amazon still isn't here and I want to get things hung up this weekend. I'll just return the Amazon one when it finally gets here. While at Target, L. calls me and updates me on her trip home. She sounds sad and I just want to give her a hug. But she'll be home a day earlier then I thought, which is nice for me.  $6.40 10 p.m. \u2014 C. spends the night again because it's too late to drive home, so we put on  Holes  (our favorite movie) and talk more about our lives. 12 a.m. \u2014 Just as I'm getting into bed after walking the dogs, D. calls me and we talk for about 30 minutes before I start falling asleep on the phone.

I make eggs, toast and add a Cutie to each plate because they're about to go bad. She leaves shortly after breakfast, and I get back in bed for a couple hours to go on my computer and read for a bit. 12 p.m. \u2014 Finally get out of bed and hang up all of my wall d\u00e9cor. I moved into this apartment almost six months ago but I have barely unpacked anything. I sold most of my furniture a few years ago just before I moved to Australia, where I lived for over a year. When I came back, I was extremely broke and was lucky that L. let me move in with her without having to put down a deposit. I was working as an office temp and my paychecks barely covered rent and bills, so I couldn't buy any new furniture for my room. I have a stable, well-paying job now, but I am moving to Belgium in about six months and I don't see the point of buying furniture at this point. The bare walls are starting to kill me, though, so I want to put up travel posters and family photos. Advertisement 4:30 p.m. \u2014 Take the train to Target. I buy Q-tips, ice cream, soda, and mozzarella sticks. When I get home, I walk and feed the dogs.  $14.97 6 p.m. \u2014 For dinner, I have mozzarella sticks and a vodka Sprite (the vodka was a Christmas present from my boss), and then ice cream for dessert. Not the healthiest meal I've had this week, but as an adult you sometimes need to do stupid things like this, I think, just to prove you can. 10 p.m. \u2014 I walk the dogs one last time, then call D. for the night. His work schedule has been crazy this last week and I'm starting to miss him.

While on the phone with her, I look online for an engagement present. I find a few things I like but nothing I love, so I don't buy anything yet. 2 p.m. \u2014 There is a reason I don't live by myself \u2013 I'm going crazy from loneliness. I need L. to come back. In order to combat the crazy, I make a menu for the week and a shopping list before I jump on the train and head to the grocery store. I buy veggies, chicken breast, rice, applesauce, and a few other items I need to make all my dinners. L. and I normally shop together and split on the spot, but I didn't want to wait for her to get back so I went myself and plan to just Venmo her for it later.  $40.78 Advertisement 4:30 p.m. \u2014 I start cooking my lunch for the week. I'm making a chicken stir-fry with rice on the side. I got a rice cooker for Christmas and it has really improved my rice game. I walk and feed the dogs while I wait for all the food to cool down so I can pack it up. 7:45 p.m. \u2014 L. has landed! I cook frozen raviolis for us for dinner while she takes the train home. When she finally gets here, my dogs go nuts and I'm very excited as well.

I close my eyes again and put off getting out of bed. 7:45 a.m. \u2014 I'm normally not up this early, but today's an important day \u2013 I have a job interview! I'm not very happy with my current job, so when I saw an opening at a lab recently, I jumped at the opportunity. I open my closet to choose my interview outfit. It's mid-January, yet I still decide on a button-down tucked into a pencil skirt (without tights). I guess I'll regret it later. I don't have time to make breakfast, so I buy a small latte and a blueberry scone on my way to the subway.  $7.63 8:20 a.m. \u2014 I arrive to my interview a little too early, but I go in anyway. I check in with the front desk and head up to the fourth floor, where I am greeted by the smiling receptionist. I first take a medication dosage test, which I am expected to get 100% on. I do (yay), and wait until the recruiter calls me in. 9:30 a.m. \u2014 Time to head off to my interview with the nurse manager! The hospital is just a couple of blocks away from the HR building, and I have enough time, so I walk leisurely and go through interview questions in my head. Advertisement 11 a.m. \u2014 I'm done! I thought the interview went well, but I try not to get my hopes up. The manager has a couple more interviews and told me that I should hear back by the end of next week. I need to pick up my student ID for school before my first day, so I take the subway down to campus. After getting my ID, I pick up lunch at my favorite Vietnamese restaurant, where I order shrimp summer rolls, a pork chop bahn mi, and a Vietnamese iced coffee. I carry all of my yummy food back home.  $21.25 5:15 p.m. \u2014 Last week, I booked a SoulCycle class for today at 5:30. I'm trying to make a habit of going at least once a week, especially since I live right around the corner from one. I check into class and rent a pair of shoes, which are free because I bought a first-timer class pack! 6:15 p.m. \u2014 That class kicked my butt! I felt like throwing up during it and attributed it to being out of shape, but even when I get home, I still feel nauseous. I sit for a little bit and wait for the nausea to pass before finally hopping in the shower. 8 p.m. \u2014 No plans for me this Friday night! I curl up in bed and binge-watch  Suits  on Amazon Prime until I fall asleep. Daily Total: $28.88", "day_two": "Day Two: 6 a.m. \u2014 I wake up to the sound of the apartment door closing. My roommate is going home for the weekend and just left. Normally I would check what time it is, but I'm too lazy (and sore from SoulCycle) to bother. I drift back to sleep. Advertisement 12 p.m. \u2014 Finally wake up after snoozing for hours! I have work tonight at 7 p.m., and I usually try to sleep as much as possible before my shift. I make myself avocado toast with eggs and then crawl back into bed to watch  Suits . (I bought a bag of avocados from Trader Joe's last week and they're finally ripe, so it looks like I'll probably be eating avocados daily for a the forseeable future.) 5 p.m. \u2014 The hardest part is getting myself out of bed and to work. I only work three days a week, but it's still incredibly draining. I put on my scrubs, throw my work stuff in a bag, and head out the door by 5:30. 5:45 p.m. \u2014 I always forget that subways run locally on the weekends. Luckily, I snag a seat, so I'm able to close my eyes for the 30-minute ride. 6:15 p.m. \u2014 I'm in desperate need of coffee, so I reload my Starbucks app ($15) and mobile order an iced latte to pick up. I realize that I haven't eaten since noon, so I swing by a deli near work and scoop up rice, beef, broccoli, chicken, and veggies into a small container ($9). I'm ready for my night of work!  $24 Daily Total: $24", "day_three": "Day Three: 7:30 a.m. \u2014 Freedom!!! I actually had a very calm night at work, which is pretty rare. I get my stuff from my locker and take the subway down to Trader Joe's to pick up groceries. I get fruit, a  Thai Citrus Chicken salad (I  live  off of this salad), cereal, yogurt, snacks, and some frozen meals. Then I hop back on the subway.  $27.66 Advertisement 8:45 a.m. \u2014 Home sweet home! I put away my groceries, kick off my scrubs, and jump in the shower. I always feel gross after a shift (who knows what germs I'm carrying around!), so I pretty much always shower as soon as I get home. I watch  Suits  while eating a bowl of cereal, and then I fall asleep without realizing it. 2:30 p.m. \u2014 Thank God I had an alarm set! I probably wouldn't have woken up otherwise. I don't have work again until Wednesday, and when I usually have a couple days off, I try not to sleep too much after work because it messes with my sleep cycle. I decide to make a trip to Target to pick up school and cleaning supplies. First, though, I need my caffeine. I stop by a coffee shop and get a large iced latte ($4.50, but I have 10 drinks on my punch card, so this one's free!) and walk over to Target. 3:30 p.m. \u2014 First stop? The dollar section. Everything's so cute! I only walk away with one thing, which I'm super proud of myself for, and then set out to find the items I actually came for. I get school and cleaning supplies ($20) and more snacks ($15.43).  $35.43 6:30 p.m. \u2014 I'm starving! I resist the urge to order out and instead make my own dinner: Trader Joe's frozen gnocchi plus two handfuls of spinach.

I dress in workout clothes just in case I don't have time to stop back home before my SoulCycle class at 12:15. I head over to the post office, which happens to be next door to my apartment, to send back my Stitch Fix order. I really loved a pair of jeans that I received, but after much debate have decided not to keep them. After the post office, I grab a skim latte.  $4.50 10:30 a.m. \u2014 I'm blessed (or cursed?) to live just a short walk away from Marshalls, so I head over. The pair of tights I'm wearing right now has a hole in the thigh area, and I've been meaning to replace them. Coincidentally, there's a sale on workout clothes! I fall in love with a pair of Reebok cropped leggings, so I get two pairs in different prints ($29.98). I check out the home goods section and find a lovely rose quartz-scented candle ($3.44). At checkout, the cashier asks if I want to donate a dollar to the children's hospital. Why not?  $34.42 Advertisement 11:15 a.m. \u2014 I still have  time before my SoulCycle class, so I head back to my apartment and change into a pair of my brand new leggings! They feel so nice and stretchy \u2013 definitely worth it. 12 p.m. \u2014 I arrive at my SoulCycle class and rent a pair of cycling shoes ($3). I grab a set of ear plugs (my ears were ringing for hours after class last time due to the loud music) and stretch. The theme of today's class is \u201cThe Evolution of Rihanna,\u201d so I'm pumped!  $3 1 p.m. \u2014 I have a major crush on the instructor, but I think he might be gay. Oh well. For lunch, I decide to get a smoothie from this little stand a couple of blocks away. I order a large chocolate, peanut butter, banana, and protein smoothie and then relax on a bench at the plaza around the corner. I text my friend about my crush on the Soul Cycle instructor, and he instantly finds the instructor on Instagram. I stalk him for a little and come to the conclusion that he's definitely gay. Story of my life.  $6 2 p.m. \u2014 Ugh, laundry time. I've put it off for too long. Luckily, I have a laundry room in my apartment building, which is rare for NYC apartments. I decide to wash my sheets too, so I do two separate loads.  $10.60 4:45 p.m. \u2014 My laundry is all dry and folded! I lay in bed and browse Buzzfeed until I get hungry. Advertisement 6 p.m. \u2014 I make myself a large pot of pesto pasta with chicken and lots of broccoli and asparagus. I'm not a very good cook and therefore don't cook a lot, but eating out gets expensive! I spoon out a generous portion and then refrigerate the rest for tomorrow. 8 p.m. \u2014 I force myself to wash the dishes and then crawl into bed. Instead of watching  Suits , I decide to read. I started  Murder on the Orient Express  back in December and am more than 75% finished with it, but haven't picked it back up in a few weeks. My goal is to read one book every month in 2018 (a goal I accomplished in 2017), and I know it'll get more difficult to find free time to read once school starts. Better get started now!

I eat a bowl of cereal for breakfast and spend the morning reading the news on my iPad and finishing  Murder on the Orient Express.  First book of 2018 is complete! 12 p.m. \u2014 Lunchtime! I heat up the rest of my pesto pasta from dinner yesterday and eat a generous serving. I never know how much pasta to cook and feel like I always end up making enough to feed a small village. Advertisement 1 p.m. \u2014 Even though my first class doesn't start until 4:55, I decide to go to my school's library to print out lecture slides. (Printing costs are covered through school.) It's uncharacteristically warm today (high 50s), and I'm sweating under my thick cardigan. I swear my body temperature is 20 degrees warmer than the average human's. 2 p.m. \u2014 I've printed and stapled my lecture slides and decide to get coffee before class. I received an email from Gregory's Coffee, where I'm a rewards member, for $2 off any drink today, so I guess I know where I'm going! I decide to walk because it's nice outside, and it takes me about 20 minutes. I order a large cold brew ($2.32, thanks to the coupon!) and kill some time there.  $2.32 3:30 p.m. \u2014 Oops, looks like I have to purchase an online book for my Statistics class. There goes $45.

It starts pouring as I begin my 10-minute walk, but luckily I have my roommate's umbrella! 9:15 p.m. \u2014 Done with my first day of graduate school! I had Research in Nursing first and then Statistics. My brain is fried! All I can think about is food. As I'm waiting for the subway, my friend texts me and asks how it went. She's also in my grad program, but missed class today because of an emergency. We make plans to meet up on Thursday for coffee so that she can tell me what happened (she says it's CRAZY), and I offer to go over notes with her as well.

I get out of bed, shower, and whip up a quick dinner using Trader Joe's frozen mushroom risotto. 6:15 p.m. \u2014 I mobile order a venti iced latte from Starbucks on my way to work using my Starbucks app. I still have money on it from the $15 I reloaded a couple of days ago, so it technically doesn't cost me anything.

Luckily, my friend messages me on Facebook to say she'd be a couple of minutes late herself. Perfect! I quickly get ready, throw on an oversized sweater and leggings, and run out the door. We're meeting at a vegan restaurant near campus, and I make it there within 20 minutes. 12:10 p.m. \u2014 My friend gets there first and saves us a table.

I am an old lady at heart and this is way past my bedtime, especially when I have to be up for work early tomorrow. Daily Total: $38", "day_three": "Day Three: 6:30 a.m. \u2014 Finally roll out of bed after pushing snooze twice \u2013 I knew it was going to be a rough morning. I jump in the shower, get dressed, and pack shredded chicken, an apple and trek mix for my lunch. I'm out of the door by 7. My ability to get ready so quickly is a super power. Advertisement 7:20 a.m. \u2014 I resist the urge to stop at my favorite coffee shop near my office and instead go to the grocery store to stock the office coffee supply. I buy creamer, two packs of coffee pods, a bottle of water, and more forks on my company credit card. I get to the office by 7:30 and organize our coffee supplies before sitting down at my desk. ($22 expensed) 9 a.m. \u2014 I go through emails and get organized while drinking two cups of (free) office coffee. I have a feeling this week is going to be very long. The owner of the company comes in and talks my ear off about his weekend. I really like him \u2014 plus our conversations usually eat up a good hour of my day, which I am totally okay with. He tells me about a conference he would like me to go to later this year. I do some research, find a great deal on airfare, and use the conference group rate to book my hotel. ($425 expensed) 4 p.m. \u2014 Wow, what a Monday! Today kicked my butt and I could not be more ready to head home. One of my favorite parts of my job is the hours. Getting off at 4 makes it feel like I have plenty of time to accomplish things after work. I pack up my stuff, starving and sleepy from the long day. 5:30 p.m. \u2014 I get home and unpack everything from my weekend. Then I fix a spinach salad with shredded chicken. For the life of me, I cannot get my new salad dressing bottle open, so I settle for olive oil and soy sauce and it is delicious! I eat my salad on the couch and catch up on TV. Advertisement 8 p.m. \u2014 I'm exhausted and starting not to feel too good. I jump in the shower (I don't like blow-drying my hair, so I normally shower at night), wash my face, and jump right in bed. I watch  Grey's Anatomy  on repeat to fall asleep. Daily Total: $0", "day_four": "Day Four: 6:30 a.m. \u2014 Snooze my alarm twice. (I set my alarm way too early so I can snooze it and lay in bed longer, which I know makes no sense.) I get out of bed, do my hair and makeup, throw on clothes, and head out the door. My office is pretty casual, which I am so thankful for. If I had to dress up every day, I would be a very cranky person. 7:30 a.m. \u2014 It's super foggy this morning, and everyone in the Pacific Northwest forgets how to drive when there is fog (or rain or, heaven forbid, snow). My commute is a little longer today but I cave and stop at my favorite coffee shop. Their espresso is so smooth and delicious. I get a triple latte with one raw sugar.  $4.25 11:30 a.m. \u2014 Things are super slow in the office, which is bizarre since we are having the best Q1 we've had since I've been here. I'm getting antsy and hungry, so I go to Subway for lunch to get out of the office. I get a foot-long turkey sandwich with lots of veggies and have every intention of saving half for tomorrow's lunch.  $7.50 Advertisement 11:45 a.m. \u2014 As I walk out to my car, I notice how dirty it is. Ever since I bought it last summer, I have been obsessed with taking good care of it. I go through the quick car wash and then go back to work, where I grab an apricot LaCroix (my favorite).  $8 3 p.m. \u2014 I finish up the application for my health insurance plan and pay the first month's premium, which I will be reimbursed for. Then I pack up my stuff and head home. ($313 expensed) 5 p.m. \u2014 I do a core workout in my living room and watch  Say Yes to the Dress , which kind of feels like torture even though I enjoy it. I eat the other half of my sandwich from today's lunch for dinner. 6 p.m. \u2014 I'm meeting my wife so that we can do our taxes together, and I am a total ball of nerves. We haven't seen each other in two weeks and it has been so hard. She's been staying with her parents, so we meet at their house and sit at the dining room table. We have a decent conversation but I can tell that she is getting antsy, so I head out. I feel hopeful for our future and that we can start to turn things around. I pay the fee to file and direct deposit our taxes.  $69.99 8 p.m. \u2014 I go to my parents' house to pick up two packages I sent there. It's nice to see my family but they always ask about my wife and how it's going, which is really difficult. I grab my packages and go back to my house. The grocery store by my parents' house is the only place I have seen apricot LaCroix in the larger boxes, so I stop in and grab a box to restock my fridge.  $4 Advertisement 9:30 p.m. \u2014 Finally home. I do my normal nightly routine and go right to sleep. Daily Total: $93.74", "day_five": "Day Five: 6:45 a.m. \u2014 After waking up throughout the night, I am exhausted and have a terrible migraine. I lay in bed for way too long while I contemplate working from home, but I feel like I need to suck it up and go into the office. I rush to get ready and leave by 7:10. 7:30 a.m. \u2014 I need  all  the coffee this morning. I brew a cup at the office but put in too much creamer, so it's kind of gross. Again, not very many emails and not a lot of big projects going on, so I know it's going to be a long day. 1 p.m. \u2014 Someone ordered pizza and I grab a slice and eat at my desk with a LaCroix while I scroll through social media. My birthday is next week, so I confirm my family dinner reservation. 4 p.m. \u2014 On my way home from work, I realize my gas is getting pretty low so I stop to fill up. Costco gas is 20 cents cheaper per gallon than the gas at any other place around, so waiting a little longer seems worth it.  $26.70 5 p.m. \u2014 Watch college basketball, start a load of laundry, and relax a little bit. During halftime, I saut\u00e9 spinach and chicken and top it with Alfredo sauce. It's delicious and I have enough to take to work tomorrow. Advertisement 7:30 p.m. \u2014 I jump in the shower and do my nightly routine before watching the new episode of  Grey's Anatomy  and heading to bed. Daily Total: $26.70", "day_six": "Day Six: 6:30 a.m. \u2014 I'm surprisingly awake and in good spirits \u2014 maybe because it's Friday? Get ready for the day, pack my lunch and clothes for the weekend (I'm housesitting for a family friend), and turn off all the lights and the heaters since I won't be back until Sunday. 7:10 a.m. \u2014 My commute is a breeze this morning; it seems like Fridays and Mondays are always less congested, which is nice. I get off the freeway with plenty of time, so I go through the Starbucks drive-through. I would much rather have coffee from my favorite place right around the corner, but this way I don't have to get out of my car. I order a triple latte and a bagel to munch on at my desk.  $7.20 12 p.m. \u2014 Take my lunch break and drive over to the house I'm staying at this weekend to check on the dogs and drop off my stuff. Once I'm back at the office, I go through emails and eat my leftover spinach and chicken. The rest of the day is pretty much a dud, so I hope I can get out of here a little early and run errands before heading back to the dogs. 3 p.m. \u2014 Freedom! Even if it's an hour early, I will take it. I leave the office and go to the store to return a couple of items I don't like enough to keep. I leave with some other items too, of course, and spend an extra $30. Before going to the house, I stop at Target to pick up thank-you cards. I also grab car air fresheners (black ice is the OG), a charcoal clay mask cleanser, a couple of makeup brushes, and an eyeshadow pallet (I don't even wear eyeshadow but it's on sale and this is Target). Only $22 in damage \u2013 not bad if you ask me.  $52 Advertisement 7 p.m. \u2014 After wrestling the dogs and catching up on garbage television, I make a quick salad and a cup of hot chamomile tea and settle in for the night. 10 p.m. \u2014 These dogs are on the tightest schedule \u2013 it's kind of insane. I let them out for the last time before putting them and myself to bed.

We are so lucky to live in a place with random gorgeous days like this one in the middle of winter. We both do a tasting flight ($20) and then order a magnum bottle of ros\u00e9 to celebrate my birthday. We split the bill and tip.  $50 1:30 p.m. \u2014 We are starved and decide on Thai food. I have been craving pad see ew and am so excited. We split the bill again.  $18 4 p.m. \u2014 I had some other things I wanted to accomplish today, but I am exhausted and honestly a little tipsy from all our wine earlier in the day. I decide to hang out with my family for a bit before calling it in early. 8 p.m. \u2014 Still exhausted and fighting a nasty wine headache, so I decide to give in for the night.

I don't need to get in until 8 a.m. (instead of my usual 7 a.m. arrival time) because I'm going climbing tonight after work and will stay later than usual at the office. We work flexible hours, and as long as I get my nine hours in every day, no one really cares what time I come in or leave. 7:45 a.m. \u2014 Get to work and find a chocolate-chip muffin scone in the break room! I bring my lunch every day and don't usually eat breakfast, but I'm not one to refuse free food. I take it back to my desk and eat it with the coffee I brought from home. 12:15 p.m. \u2014 Take a break from working (and IM-ing my friends) to warm up the beef stew I brought from home. I prepared a huge crock-pot of it on Sunday and have been eating my way through it this week. I don't meal prep per se, especially because I get bored of the same meals after so many days, but I do occasionally make large batches of things. One more day left! 1:30 p.m. \u2014 The friend I'm supposed to go climbing with tonight shoots me an IM that he's been sneezing all morning and might have to bail. Bummer. Clearly, some sort of illness has been spreading around the office. I think about the Mucinex in my purse (since I've also been sick the past few days), but decide to wait until later to take my next dosage. Advertisement 4:45 p.m. \u2014 I am outta here! My climbing partner officially bails, but I go anyway to get time on the hangboards and tension board. 7:20 p.m. \u2014 Home from the gym and I am starving! My roommates beat me home and to the stove and I'm sadly stuck devouring goat cheese and beet crackers until they finish cooking. 7:45 p.m. \u2014 Find a leftover quinoa, tofu, tomato, and cucumber mixture in the back of my fridge that probably needs to be eaten soon. I throw it on the stove and make a stir-fry with leftover bacon grease from my roommate's dinner (LOL, super healthy) and coconut aminos mixed in. I sit down on the couch to enjoy my strange concoction. 9 p.m. \u2014 Time for  How to Get Away with Murder ! I watch Queen Viola Davis slay, as per usual, and then shower and go to sleep.

I'm out the door at 6:30 for my 30-minute commute. 7 a.m. \u2014 Sadly, there's no free food in the break room today. I settle in to read emails and daydream about the weekend. 11:10 a.m. \u2014 I succumb to my hunger and warm up the last of my beef stew. Advertisement 12 p.m. \u2014 Finally hear back from a boy I've gone on a few dates with, L.*, about whether he's free to hang out on Saturday. He's not, and I'm somewhat annoyed. He has poor texting skills, and we barely communicate at all outside of our dates. I channel my annoyance into finally setting up a date with the other guy I've been messaging, B.*, who suggested that we see a horror movie together sometime. I research tomorrow's movie times at the theater near me and send him suggestions. 3 p.m. \u2014 It's officially the weekend! I basically sprint out of the building to my car. I am very ready to be sitting on my couch, but first, I need to stop at Party City to pick up decorations for our Super Bowl party this weekend! 3:30 p.m. \u2014 After some playful banter with a Patriots fan, I escape Party City without doing too much damage. I get plates, napkins, and a tablecloth.  $16.91 5:45 p.m. \u2014 All my roommates are home, so we start cooking our HelloFresh meal. A friend of mine from college periodically gives us her free boxes, and tonight it's turkey pesto burgers. They turn out delicious, and it is always fun to share a dinner with all four of my roommates. 8:30 p.m. \u2014 One of my roommates and I settle down on the couch to watch  50 Shades of Grey.  We want to see the new one when it comes out in theaters, so we have to catch up on the previous ones. When it ends, we put on  Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives , and my roomie comments on how I moan more about Guy Fieri and his food than I did over Christian Grey.

I still have time to kill before my eye doctor appointment, so I run to Starbucks for a cold brew and a breakfast sandwich. The total comes to $8.93, but I pay with my preloaded Gold card. It's absolutely gorgeous out, so I sit on the patio. 10:40 a.m. \u2014 Next stop: eye doctor. I escape mostly unscathed. I pay $91 from my HSA for the contact fitting and optomap, and another $121.20 out of pocket for my contact lenses. (I don't have enough money in my HSA to cover both.) I have a $100 rebate on the contacts, which brings that total down to $21, and I will eventually reimburse myself via my HSA!  $112.20 11:15 a.m. \u2014 Next, I hop over to Trader Joe's to buy ingredients for my Super Bowl wings, including soy sauce, pickled jalape\u00f1os, sriracha, balsamic vinegar, honey, and brown sugar, and then some things for myself: green juice, half and half, mandarin oranges, cheddar rockets, granola bars, cookies, and frozen chicken tikka samosas.  $40.07 12 p.m. \u2014 I head to Sam's Club to buy frozen wings but decide that a 10-pound bag is way more than I need.

Having grown up in Maryland, I am a diehard Baltimore Ravens fan, but I will happily root for anyone to beat the Patriots. My friend from Boston storms out of our house but everyone else seems to have a great time. We are left with lots of leftovers, which is good because I didn't buy a lot of lunch food for the week.

I split most of my expenses between two different cards, and I typically end up with a statement balance between $500 and $600 on each. 11 a.m. \u2014 I've already eaten my apple and the leftover quesadilla I brought to work. Luckily, I still have wings and other snacks but I'm thinking today is going to be a long, hungry day. 4 p.m. \u2014 Escape work and head home to devour as many Super Bowl leftovers as I can before my class at the climbing gym tonight. I eat a leftover grilled cheese, hummus, and too many hot Cheetos. 6:10 p.m. \u2014 Fill up on gas on my way to the gym.

I didn't get the chance to snack at all this morning and I'm ravenous. I eat a leftover grilled cheese sandwich while catching up on emails. 12 p.m. \u2014 I see an email from the automatic job search I set up within my company. I love my current job, but I have long said that if this job became available, I would definitely apply. I get an immediate wave of panic-induced adrenaline and manage to update my r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and pump out a cover letter within the next hour.

My pieces are semi-dry and ready to be trimmed and fired for their first time in the kiln! 5 p.m. \u2014 I trim and throw a few big, bottle-shaped vases I'm really proud of. Then I go to school for a few hours of undistracted studying. 8 p.m. \u2014 Head home so that I can cook my first Blue Apron meal of the week. Blue Apron is super convenient and the ingredients and recipes are always interesting, plus it saves me the process of planning a grocery list for only one person. Tonight, I'm making Mexican-spiced barramundi with a kale, sweet potato, and an avocado salad. Advertisement 12:30 a.m. \u2014 Check my school calendar before passing out.

I send a couple of emails and then take pictures of my new ceramic pieces for my Etsy shop. I spend my lunch break editing pictures and posting them while eating leftovers from last night. 2:30 p.m. \u2014 Back to flashcards, made more exciting this time with the addition of a sparkling water energy drink. 5 p.m. \u2014 I'm feeling stir crazy and go on a bike ride for a change of scenery. I spin around my neighborhood and stop by CVS to pick up hydrating Korean face masks. I went to the dermatologist for the first time ever a few weeks ago, and my skin is still getting used to the retinoids.  $9.62 8 p.m.  \u2014 I take a break from studying to eat dinner \u2014 more of the Trader Joe's salad and gyoza I found in my freezer.

I change out of my comfy clothes for the first time this week for a more professional get-up. 1 p.m. \u2014 Lunch is the last of my barramundi leftovers. I go to FedEx to get my picture printed and then to my school's international affairs office to renew my passport. I have a couple of weeks off after my board exam and I am using that time to travel abroad with my family. The passport process is an inconvenient nightmare: My picture was printed on the wrong paper and I have to buy a money order because the office doesn't take cards. Thankfully, my father says he'll pay some of the passport fees.  $135 4 p.m. \u2014 Time for my clinical skills exam! The \"patient\" is coming in for a follow-up on their chronic hypertension. As a second-year student, I should have a handle on things, but I still struggle with interpreting an EKG! 6:30 p.m. \u2014 Get started on dinner, a brussels sprout and pearl couscous salad with harissa frying cheese. It's delicious and hopefully balances out the slice of chocolate cake I eat afterward. 7 p.m. \u2014 K. comes over and we catch up on our weeks, discuss the news, and watch Netflix before he leaves so that I can get some reading in.

I spend the morning researching public health statistics because today I'm going to the Capitol building to lobby for a bill expanding needle exchange facilities statewide. It's a topic I'm passionate about because I used to be an HIV tester before starting school. It's really unfortunate that the state cut even more funding for public health programs last year. 10:30 a.m. \u2014 Unbeknownst to me, I accidentally get on an express elevator and it shoots me up more than 20 floors in a matter of seconds. I survive the tower of terror, go to the correct floor, and arrive just in time for the press conference. It is inspiring seeing all the lawmakers, medical students, and pharmacists who are here supporting the bill! After the conference, I tag along with a group of medical students to lobby. We spend more time navigating the hallways than speaking to aides and legislators, but it still is a good experience. 12 p.m. \u2014 Head to school, where I eat my leftovers from last night. I try to buy tickets to see Ira Glass speak in a couple of weeks but the affordable student tickets are sold out. I kick myself for not getting them sooner. 2 p.m. \u2014 In my mandatory small group meeting, where we discuss patient cases relating to hematology and oncology with a doctor facilitator. Afterward, I go to the library to study. Advertisement 8:30 p.m. \u2014 It's late and I'm too hungry to cook. My only remaining motivation is to order tacos from my favorite place near school.

I check my credit card and my Blue Apron box for next week gets charged. 11 a.m. \u2014  I go to school for a lunch-and-learn about minorities in medicine. I love these events because, as a student, I am always down for free food, and the speakers are usually really interesting. Today is no exception: the speaker talks about his personal experiences as a minority physician training in orthopedic surgery in the South. I relate to a lot of the stories he shares. 4:30 p.m. \u2014 Head over to USPS right before closing time to drop off some Etsy orders and then head to Publix for fruit, iced coffee, bread, and hand lotion.  $24.30 7 p.m. \u2014 Thanks to Blue Apron, I make a ginger-marinated steak with bok choy in less than an hour. I complain to K. about not feeling up to socializing tonight because I'm so stressed about studying, but I make plans for tomorrow to go to Cascades Park and a brewery with classmates so that I don't become too much of a shut-in.

I'm terrible at waking up and have once (or twice\u2026) missed an important work meeting due to sleeping in, so my partner has started calling me in the mornings before work. 8:30 a.m. \u2014 I make sure I look fairly presentable for work in the office bathroom and then grab a coffee and a nectarine from the caf\u00e9. (All the food on campus at my workplace is free.) When I get back to my desk, I start looking into nearby animal sanctuaries to visit for Presidents' Day with my partner since we both have the day off. 10:30 a.m. \u2014 Sell my old rice cooker to a coworker for $60. I couldn't bear to part with it after I moved into my car but it's been collecting dust ever since. 12 p.m. \u2014 My partner emails me a link to an article about Ariana Grande visiting PreetiRang Sanctuary, so we're both sold on visiting there. I send the sanctuary a tour request and cross my fingers! 1 p.m. \u2014 I donate $500 to Figure Skating in Harlem, an organization for girls of color, and their sister program, Figure Skating in Detroit, as part of my skating-themed money experiment for this month.

Advertisement 1:30 p.m. \u2014 I bike to a caf\u00e9 at work for lunch. They have vegan chocolate cupcakes (yum!) and I grab two for later, plus vegan pad Thai. I eat a cupcake before biking back. 2 p.m. \u2014 Back at my desk and starting my Money Diary. I actually just found out about Money Diaries yesterday and initially thought I would write one in the nebulous future when my life would be more interesting, but then I reconsidered. Why not now? 4 p.m. \u2014 Eat the other chocolate cupcake. 5 p.m. \u2014 I check my company's stock price and it has dropped quite a bit. The trading window for employees is currently open and I have a lot of vested shares I want to sell, but I'll wait until the price (hopefully) goes up again. During my first few years at this job, I didn't look at my shares at all. I didn't really know what it all meant and was too lazy and intimidated to figure it out. It wasn't until last year that I realized I should be selling my shares! 5:15 p.m. \u2014 I sponsor a hen residing at Hen Harbor, an animal sanctuary I've visited before. She was rescued from an urban flock of backyard hens, where she assumed the role of the rooster and started crowing. A gender non-conforming chicken!

I'll submit a reimbursement form from my HSA later.  $550.20 3:30 p.m. \u2014 When I get back to the office, my dad calls me because I asked for the account login to our family phone account.

It's the first credit card I ever got and the phone bill is all I use it for now, but it's been on auto-pay for forever and I haven't been able to log in!

My partner arrives, we find seats, and the play starts! 9 p.m. \u2014 My partner and I walk to a caf\u00e9 and I buy juice so that we have a reason to be there.

It works out well because I need to stop by someone's desk on the other side of campus anyway. 3 p.m. \u2014 I go to aerial silks class. I'm feeling stronger!

I change my clothes while my husband cooks the salmon, and then I entertain our toddler with a series of stretches for a fitness challenge I'm doing; she climbs all over me. We eat dinner and my daughter insists on switching plates with me. She also thinks sweet potato cubes are cookies (apparently anything we put in the oven to bake = cookies right now) and gladly eats a lot of them. After dinner, we play and I do the dishes and straighten up. Then it's bath time and pajamas. It's my night to read so we read six books before I put her in her crib, say goodnight, and she's out.

We sit down around 6 and my daughter basically has a tantrum all of dinner. First, she wants my food, then she wants to eat sitting on my lap, then she doesn't want to eat. After dinner, I hang out with our daughter while my husband cleans up. (She won't let me go in the kitchen to clean and it isn't worth the battle.) We start bedtime but I have to leave to go to a Mason jar salad party with fellow challengers from the exercise group I'm in! I grab bring along snacks: an opened bag of pita chips and tzatziki from Costco. I feel slightly bad about the open bag of chips, but it's casual and no one cares.

I didn't get to see my daughter this morning because she actually slept in a bit. (She usually wakes up when she hears me going up and down the stairs.) The commute takes about 45 minutes, and I drink my coffee while driving. 8:30 a.m. \u2014 The worksite I'm at today provides snacks for employees, so I grab a Naked Green Machine smoothie and peanut butter crackers with coffee. 11:45 a.m. \u2014 I was going to run at lunch but decided not to, due to a combination of icy sidewalks, sore feet, and general laziness. I eat my chicken and berry Mason jar salad and follow it up with M&M's. I drink have two Diet Cokes (one from home and one free from work). I have a Diet Coke addiction ... and a sweets addiction. 1:30 p.m. \u2014 Call the YMCA to register my toddler for a tumbling class.

I got him one for Christmas but it was too big, so I returned it and got a refund. The new band is $0.95 more, so I pay the difference.  $0.95 11:30 a.m. \u2014 Grab snacks.

My husband usually buys a donut for me from the Dunkin' Donuts at the grocery store, but he left it on a shelf along with his coffee! My daughter got her two Munchkins while shopping, though ($2.99).  $98.58 Advertisement 12 p.m. \u2014 We play at the park, have lunch, and then put the toddler down for her nap before I go out for my run.

(I've been brewing at home more often lately in an attempt to avoid purchasing the overpriced coffee at the caf\u00e9 in my building.) It's chilly out but nice enough to walk; the university I work at gives me a free yearly bus and Metro pass, but since it's less than a mile away, I usually travel on foot. 12:30 p.m. \u2014 Most days, I eat in the lunch room with my coworkers, but today, we have a presentation on women's reproductive health. A vulvovaginal dermatologist presents some of the diseases she specializes in treating; the subject matter might gross people out (especially while eating lunch) but I've been working with this lab for years and it doesn't faze me. 3 p.m. \u2014 Feeling the late-afternoon slump hard, I take a short break and grab a granola bar from the vending machine, as well as a cup of free hot chocolate from the department's stock. Most of my actual lab work is done for the day, so I take the treats back to my desk and catch up on documentation for the few projects I'm working on.  $1.25 7 p.m. \u2014 After a long day in the lab, I walk home. For dinner, I haphazardly throw together a meal of frozen veggies and boxed mac and cheese before I visit my parents. They live about 20 minutes away from me, so I try to make an effort to visit them at least once a week, if not more. I'm in the process of applying to graduate programs and I know that if I get in, I'll move across the country and won't be able to see them as often, so I'm trying to make the most of living in the same town as them for now.

Our lab doesn't have a dress code because we're wearing lab coats most of the day (besides long pants and closed-toe shoes for safety reasons), but on Fridays, I tend to wear leggings and a hoodie, which is far more casual than what I wear the rest of the week. It saves me time in the morning and is a lot more comfortable. I pack my bag, walk to work, and begin the day. 12 p.m. \u2014 Our department has regular lunch seminars where labs can present what they've been working on lately. They always provide free pizza (which is pretty much my main motivation to go to these things). I get two slices of cheese and a cup of coffee. The seminar today is about tuberculosis and it's pretty interesting. 4 p.m. \u2014 After a long day working on isolating DNA from samples and culturing plates of bacteria for future experiments, I finally get a chance to sit down and catch up on documentation. I try to write in my lab notebook every day, and if I do something different than normal, I note that. I grab a hot tea and get to work. 6 p.m. \u2014 After work, I head home and pack. I'm driving to see my boyfriend for the weekend. He lives an hour and a half away in the town we both went to college in, so we try to see each other every weekend or at least every other weekend. I fill my tank for less than $20 (love those Midwest gas prices!), grab a snack from the gas station, and hit the road. I recently got my first credit card, and I've been using it to pay for gas because I earn 5% back on gas station purchases during this quarter. I'm still new to the whole credit card thing, so I try to be cautious with how much I use it. So far it's been working out. I have a pretty decent credit score already because I make my student loan payments on time, but I know I need to build it up more.  $23 Advertisement 9 p.m. \u2014 My partner isn't much of a cook, but he attempts to make grilled cheese sandwiches and tomato soup for dinner. It's not too bad, and we're all about saving money by cooking at home as often as possible. We spend the evening catching up and watching Amazon's new show,  Electric Dream .

I get a dirty iced chai tea latte, my favorite! It's pricey, but I know the owners of the shop and I'm happy to support a local business.  $5.30 2 p.m. \u2014 My friend has Kohl's Cash that he wants to spend, so we go to the local shopping center. It's a small town so having Kohl's is a big deal. We spend a bit of time browsing, and I find a blue button-up top that  actually fits  over my bust (!) and is on sale!

She's pretty independent and does fine on her own for a day or two, but he lets me know he's been over to feed her.  $10.88 8:30 p.m. \u2014 My friend and I decide to meet for beers at our local craft brewery. I've been trying to do Dry January and it has been going well so far, but I really miss the local beer, so I get one and pay for one of hers, too. I have cash, which I use instead of my card.

I consider going for a jog this morning, but I really hate running in freezing temps because I don't have the proper gear. I do some light stretching instead. Today is cold, but I don't feel like waiting for the bus, so I just walk. 12 p.m. \u2014 One of my coworkers presents a paper she's working on and hoping to submit soon. We give feedback on her work, and after the meeting is over, it's back to the lab. I eat the leftover spaghetti I brought and an apple.

I grab my reusable bags and head to the Trader Joe's about 20 minutes away. I usually go to Schnucks (a local supermarket chain) but I specifically want a few Trader Joe's items. I pick up plenty of fresh veggies, a loaf of bread, cheese, beans, rice, almond butter, hummus, coffee, oranges, chickpeas, granola bars, a bottle of merlot, a few tins of cat food, and other odds and ends. This will last me about two weeks. I have a system: eat all the produce and perishables first, then subsist on beans and rice for the last week until I get paid and can go shopping again.  $90.15 8 p.m. \u2014 When I get home, I listen to Sango while I cook dal with rice for my dinner. I've come to really love cooking in the past year. There's something romantic and beautiful about filling my tiny kitchen with the aroma of garlic, ginger, and onions, and then creating a dish out of individual ingredients. A coworker gifted me a box of garam masala seasoning, which brings the dal to a whole new level. I put aside enough for my lunch tomorrow before digging in. 11 p.m. \u2014 I try out a new face mask that makes my skin so bright and clear!

My impatience gets the best of me, and I walk in the cold rather than wait for the bus. 12:30 p.m. \u2014 A few of my coworkers also brought lunch from home today, so we all hang out and eat. We end up sitting and chatting for a while before going back to the lab. I've been working on getting samples ready for sequencing for about a week now, so I'm really excited to finally get it done. 6 p.m. \u2014 With the samples submitted, I finish up some documentation and walk home. I spend my evening Skyping with a long-distance friend while snacking on red peppers and hummus. After we say our goodbyes, I relax in a hot bubble bath and make it through a chunk of the book I checked out from the library. 11 p.m. \u2014 Bedtime!

(I tutor on and off during the semesters. It's a nice way to make a bit of extra cash when I have the time.) I usually tutor high-school students because I'm more familiar with their math level; it's been a while since I worked with any elementary schoolers, but how hard can it be, right? We set up a time to meet. I charge $30 per hour, but the first consultation is free. Advertisement 3 p.m. \u2014 My student loan bill is on auto-pay, and I get a notification that this month's transaction was successful. Yay! Chipping away at that debt piece by piece. Around this same time, I start to get a migraine aura. I suffer from migraines a few times a month. They happen less in the winter, but I think this one was triggered by the big temperature jump today. For me, aura includes scintillating scotoma, which basically looks like an oscillating, shimmering fractal pattern disturbing my normal vision in one eye. Luckily, my job offers really great paid sick time (and my boss is very understanding about migraines), so I am able to go home early and take my medication. Then it's just a matter of laying in my room in the dark and waiting for it to go away. 8 p.m. \u2014 Migraines always throw off the rest of my day a little bit. Once this one subsides enough, I force myself to eat toast and drink plenty of water. The medication gives me side effects (brain fog, exhaustion, and a decreased appetite), but they usually wear off in a few hours. I read more of my book, play with my cat, and browse the Internet for a bit before heading to bed.

I head to work and try to spend the majority of my time on the subway meditating; it keeps me from getting ticked off at the MTA system. 10 a.m. \u2014 Start my day with quinoa hot cereal from Trader Joe's. I throw in nuts and honey for excitement because it tastes like hot, grainy cardboard by itself. 11 a.m. \u2014 The phone in my office is ringing off the hook today, making it difficult to get my work done. I do deep breathing and get back in the game. I am the first point of contact for clients and I like speaking with new people all day, but it can be hard to jump from interacting with clients back to creating reports and spreadsheets.

I decide to make hot chocolate instead of my typical coffee, and I pair it with SkinnyPop and prepare to leave for the day. My parents ordered a new mattress for my birthday (my first full-sized mattress!) and I can't wait to get home and set up my first adult bed. 6:30 p.m. \u2014 Get home and sadness ensues: the mattress has not arrived yet. I throw together snacks for dinner and pack a change of clothes for my workout tomorrow. Generous sister is taking me to my first barre class after work! 8:30 p.m. \u2014 Full-on skincare routine is in play tonight. I cleanse and then apply facial mist,  exfoliating serum, and a moisturizing facial oil. 10 p.m. \u2014 The mattress finally arrives and I am too excited to not open it immediately. I sweat profusely while setting it up and make a mental note to do more physical activity. Then I open a bag of gummies, intending to have just one, and end up inhaling half the bag. 10:30 p.m. \u2014 I FaceTime my long-distance boyfriend and he unloads his work stress onto me. We plan a hotel night for the upcoming weekend and say goodnight. We usually split everything evenly between us, but he just got a raise and a bonus so he pays for the hotel.

I've been trying to be more flexible when things don't work out perfectly, but it's a struggle for my type-A personality. Instead, I practice deep breathing on my walk from the subway to the office, but it doesn't last long because I get lightheaded. 9:30 a.m. \u2014 I avoid a specific walking route that passes by my guilty pleasure coffee spot, La Colombe. I recently read that relying on willpower alone is often ineffective when trying to break habits, so I try to outsmart my brain. Mission fails as I pass by another enticing coffee shop and succumb to the soy latte devil.

Sadly, I am vastly under-qualified for all of these jobs. 3 p.m. \u2014 Munch on my TJ's salad and wish it was anything other than a salad. Somehow, I end up on Glossier's website. I peek at a few items that interested me in the store a few days ago and search for a gift for my sister's upcoming birthday. Just like that, I have fallen down the online shopping rabbit hole once again. I buy a lip gloss, two bottles of the Solution, and a highlighter.  $85 Advertisement 4:30 p.m. \u2014 I text my mom about a ballet performance I'm interested in seeing on Thursday. She's intrigued as well, so we each buy our own tickets.  $29 6 p.m. \u2014 Sister can't find a barre class that I can make it to in time, so we reschedule. I stop at a grocery store for ranch and tomato sauce, frozen veggies, and echinacea tea to (hopefully) help boost my immunity. Flu season is too real.  $29 8:30 p.m. \u2014 I heat up zucchini noodles with spicy tomato sauce.

Instead of my usual latte, I compromise with a plain coffee.  $3 11 a.m. \u2014 They've added some new protocols at our office and everyone moans and groans about it. I do the same but secretly am excited to have more things to do! I've been having somewhat of an existential crisis for the past six months or so. This is only my first full-time job since graduating, but I feel like I'm not developing any of my skills here and haven't had any luck finding something else yet.

The book has seriously helped me navigate this rocky transition I'm experiencing post-graduation. I'm jumping out of my chair thinking about meeting her tonight! 5:30 p.m. \u2014 I attempt to place an order on Forever21.com for shirt options to wear on my birthday, but the page keeps freezing. I take it as a sign that I shouldn't spend money on clothes I'll only wear once. 6:30 p.m. \u2014 I Uber to the seminar but arrive quite early, so I pop into CVS intending only to browse but end up buying a lipstick I've had my eye on.  $8.50 8:30 p.m. \u2014 The seminar is very intimate, which I love. Yael begins with a guided meditation that includes Buddhist-style singing bowls. The rest of the time is spent talking about loneliness and how we can become comfortable with the feeling rather than fighting it. She signs my book and I chat with her for a bit but then I get really flustered and bolt out of the room! 9:30 p.m. \u2014 Grab the subway home and nosh on leftover sad French fries from my lunch.

I nibble on the tortilla strips it came with and make a cup of hot chocolate to hold me over until dinner. 5:45 p.m. \u2014 I leave work a few minutes early to see the ballet I got tickets for with my mom and sister. 8 p.m. \u2014 The show has a fantastic live jazz band accompanying the dancing and exceeds all our expectations. Afterward, we Uber to an Indian restaurant for a feast. My sister pays for the Uber and my mom pays for the food. I not-so-subtly try to convince my sister to write a Money Diary because she makes bank and I really want to know more about her financial management.

I try to make breakfast most days, but today I'm just not hungry today, so I throw leftovers in a bag to eat at work. I also drink a ton of water and take vitamins in the morning. Right now I'm taking vitamin D, vitamin C, N-acetyl cysteine, and BioSil, plus B complex whenever I eat. When I'm ready for work, I give the dog a Kong filled with pumpkin and tell her to kennel up. Then I walk to the co-op and buy a kale Caesar salad and a passionfruit LaCroix for lunch later ($5.24). (I buy all my groceries at a food cooperative.) I stop next door and buy a double bone-dry cappuccino from Starbucks ($4.35) before catching the bus to work.  $9.59 9 a.m. \u2014 Eat Thai leftovers for breakfast and take my B complex. A coworker gets in about an hour after me and since it's a slow morning, we decide to do a coffee run. He treats me to another cappuccino. (I'm addicted.) Advertisement 3 p.m. \u2014 I leave a little early. I always answer emails in the evening (both faculty and students expect it), so to balance things out, I try not to stay in the office very late. I stop by the co-op for groceries and buy coconut milk, fish sauce, shrimp, curry paste, broccoli, cauliflower, avocado, ginger, garlic, onion, red pepper, oranges, and a grapefruit.  $51.33 5 p.m. \u2014 Wanted to go for a run, but it's raining super hard and I'm starting to catch a cold from my husband, J.*, so I just get into bed. He does the evening dog care shift and comes home soaking wet. Neither of us feels like cooking, so J. goes out to pick up a pizza \u2014 and he brings home candy to entice me out of bed.

It evens out because I have to stay late at work today anyway. I email my coworkers, say goodbye to my husband, and go back to bed. 8:30 a.m. \u2014 I rouse myself and walk the dog. Then I make myself avocado toast with an egg on top and orange slices for breakfast. I also take my vitamins. My vitamin D levels are always really low due to the Seattle climate. Watch an episode of  The Good Place  while eating breakfast. 10 a.m. \u2014 Realize the sun is shining, so I walk to Starbucks and buy a cappuccino before catching the bus to work.  $4.35 Advertisement 12:30 p.m. \u2014 I grab a sesame seed bagel with strawberry cream cheese for lunch and start to feel a little better. I also refill my water bottle.  $4.26 6 p.m. \u2014 Catch the bus and head home. I was supposed to start a new dance class tonight but I just don't have the energy. On my way home, I pick up hot food from the co-op deli for dinner: rice, steamed veggies, saut\u00e9ed greens, butter chicken, and mac and cheese. I also grab a can of passionfruit LaCroix.

I make breakfast to-go, take my vitamins, and get dressed for work while J. takes out the dog and feeds her. When I'm ready, I take her out for a 30-minute walk, scramble to get all my things together and run to catch the bus. 7:30 a.m. \u2014 Work, work, work. My job is always changing and the needs vary from person to person, so it's definitely never boring, although sometimes it is stressful. I eventually take a break from working to eat oatmeal with frozen blueberries, honey, chia seeds, and smashed pecans that I brought from home. I also get a drip coffee. (It's cheaper and sometimes just cozier than a cappuccino.)  $2.15 11 a.m. \u2014 I eat lunch early today (leftovers from last night) because it's just an early kind of day. After I. finish, I decide to take a walk through my building because it's still cold and rainy outside. I'm feeling much better, so perhaps I've successfully warded off a cold! Advertisement 3:30 p.m. \u2014 Head out of the office to my therapy appointment and realize I am starving. I'm early, so I grab a slice of pizza from across the street ($3.58). I've been seeing my therapist once a week for over a year. She's in my health insurance network, so I pay $11.20 for each visit, and she bills me at the end of each month. If she didn't take my health insurance or if my insurance didn't cover mental health, each visit would cost $170, so I feel incredibly fortunate. I wish there were fewer access barriers to good care in this country. My therapist gives me a bill for the past few sessions and I put it in my purse to look at later.  $3.58 5 p.m. \u2014 Miss the bus home and decide to walk, since it's still kind of light out (yay!) and not raining (double yay!). Walking is my main source of exercise and a great way to meditate. Because I live in Seattle, every walk involves a sizable hill. When I get home, J. has cleaned the kitchen and I decide to finally make the shrimp soup curry I've been wanting to try.  (I bought the ingredients a few days ago.) The recipe method is weird: it's soup, but I'm supposed to steam the broccoli separately and mix the coconut milk with chicken stock in a different bowl. I ignore the instructions and put everything into a soup pot like I normally would. It ends up being delicious! Husband and I eat dinner together and catch up on our days.

They groggily get up for their morning routine and I immediately fall back asleep until 6. 6 a.m. \u2014 Get up, walk dog. We meet a puppy on our walk and are both stoked. My dog absolutely loves other dogs \u2013 puppies in particular. She was chained up in a backyard for the first five years of her life and had multiple litters of puppies without getting the care she needed. When we got her, she had broken teeth (from chewing on a chain), long claws (from never getting nail trims), a fear of men, and horrendous leash behavior. We walk her so much, regardless of weather, because it gives her consistency and gives us all a chance to practice leash-walking. She has come a long way since we got her two years ago. She sits patiently and quietly when she first sees a dog and I can see her using all her little willpower to be good so she can say hello. If you'd told me two years ago that she would learn how to do this, I would have never believed it. 6:30 a.m. \u2014 Get home and do my morning routine. While I put lunch together, I remember that I have lunch plans today with a friend I used to work with at my previous job. This means I don't have to lug a giant bag of Tupperware on the bus! Advertisement 8 a.m. \u2014 It's a gorgeous morning (read: light outside and raining slightly, Seattle's version of 80 degrees and sunny), so I walk to Starbucks and get the egg-white bites and a bone-dry cappuccino. My philosophy about money is that if I'm hitting my savings goal and paying my bills and rent responsibly, I can spend the rest of my paycheck on whatever I want.  $8.48 11:30 a.m. \u2014 Walk to meet up with friends from my old job. It's great to catch up with them and hear updates on the department and their personal lives. We meet for cheap conveyor belt sushi with student prices. Walk back to the office to put in more werk.  $16.97 3:30 p.m. \u2014 Get home and immediately start brown rice to go with curry soup leftovers for dinner. I clean the apartment a little and look for past billing statements from my therapist. I checked my bill this morning and notice I'd been overcharged, so I rifle through my extremely disorganized filing \"system\" (a.k.a. the drawer where I put bills after I pay them) and find the past statements. I'll bring everything to my next appointment and get it sorted out. 5 p.m. \u2014 Husband and I eat dinner and put on  Ocean's Eleven . I saw it years ago when it came out but haven't seen it since and I forgot that it's actually really good! (I'm excited for the next one because Rihanna.) I also take a hit from J.'s weed vape pen that we occasionally smoke throughout the week. Because weed is legal here, the stigma around marijuana use is virtually nonexistent. It's nice to live in a place that's ahead of the curve on this subject, but we keep an eye on the federal government. Halfway through the movie, the munchies hit and we start to crave sweets. It's pouring outside so J. orders us cookies to be delivered. Perks of living in the city.

I have a huge headache that's verging on a migraine. I hope water and fresh air will help. We go straight back to bed afterward. 8 a.m. \u2014 Friday is the best because it's my telework day! Teleworking is extremely common in the tech field, but higher education hasn't quite caught on yet. I'm lucky to have a boss who wants to retain good tech talent and has incorporated this option. I open my laptop and start on emails. Once my inbox is under control, I take a break to do a yoga flow and get ready to meet a friend nearby. 10 a.m. \u2014 I take my dog out and get her settled in her bed with a Kong and some balls to keep her occupied. She has never destroyed anything in our house, so I trust her to be out of her kennel occasionally when she's home alone. I head up to the coffee shop, get settled with my friend, and order a cappuccino and avocado toast with an egg and pickled cabbage. It's delicious, and my headache subsides!  $15.40 12:30 p.m. \u2014 After catching up with my friend and working a little bit, I get up for a break and order another item. I try not to camp out at coffee shops for too long without buying anything because I think it's rude. My general rule is to purchase one menu item per hour. So I get their pear and cranberry shrub.  $5.13 Advertisement 1:30 p.m. \u2014 I pack up and head back home to do more work. My neighbor texts me to see if I'm around for a dog playdate. Our dogs love playing together, and my neighbor has a nice-sized fenced yard, so the dogs can really party. While the dogs play, my neighbor and I have a glass of wine on her patio and enjoy the sunshine. J. texts and asks me out on a date tonight. We've been married for two and a half years, but I still get butterflies. 5 p.m. \u2014 J. comes home and takes care of dog duty. Then we decide to walk to a new place for dinner that we've been wanting to try called How To Cook A Wolf. My headache has subsided, but the rain is back, so we take a bus there. We walk in without a reservation but get a spot at the bar because we're so early. I order spaghetti and a glass of wine, and J. gets the gnocchi. It's all absolutely delicious! He picks up the tab. 7 p.m. \u2014 We stop by Trader Joe's and get snacks for our drive tomorrow. J. pays for those too. The rain has lessened a little bit, so we walk home. Living in the Pacific Northwest in the winter is like living in a rain cloud. 9 p.m. \u2014 We get home and take the dog out. Then we have romantic quality time, which is the best! I stay in bed and read while J. goes out to the living room and watches TV. Advertisement Daily Total: $20.53", "day_six": "Day Six: 6 a.m. \u2014 Dog alarm! She doesn't care about sleeping in on Saturdays; she's just hungry, so I feed her breakfast and we go for a long walk. 7 a.m. \u2014 Get home, make peanut butter toast and coffee for breakfast, start laundry, and pack. We booked an Airbnb for the night in a town outside the city where most of our friends live. Our plan is to move there one day, but there aren't as many career opportunities in that area, so for now, we're saving for a down payment and keeping an eye on job postings. 9:30 a.m. \u2014 We take the dog to her annual vet appointment. Our dog is strange in that she absolutely loves the vet and gets very excited in the car once she recognizes the vet office's street. She gets a Bordetella vaccine, a complimentary nail trim, a six-month supply of Trifexis, and most importantly, a clean bill of health. A couple of years ago, census data showed that more dogs than children live in Seattle, so we don't skimp on the vaccines or parasite protection. The cost for the visit comes out of our savings, earmarked for dog costs.  $234.72 10:30 a.m. \u2014 We get home and J. gets himself ready for the weekend while I walk to the UPS store. I have a care package to send my sister, who's in college. The total for packing supplies and shipping comes to $15.24. Then I pop into the used bookstore down the block. Their inventory is excellent and they have a hilarious shop cat who yells at every customer. She won't stop until you greet her so I chat with her a little while I browse. I pick up  My Brilliant Friend  by Elena Ferrante and  The Boston Girl  by Anita Diamant ($18.72).  $33.96 Advertisement 11 a.m. \u2014 There's an Aesop store on my way home, and I've been thinking about getting their Marrakech Intense rollerball for the past two months. (I stop in once a week to use the tester.) At $95, it's an expensive splurge for me, but today I walk in and decide to just buy the dang thing because I really do love it.  $104.60 11:15 a.m. \u2014 Starbucks is right next door, so I figure since I've already spent hundreds of dollars today, I may as well get a cappuccino.  $3.58 1:30 p.m. \u2014 We pack up the car and get on the road! My car is 15 years old and I take very good care of it. We could probably get by without a car where we live, but it's nice to have for large grocery trips, hauling the dog around, and getting out of the city. I drive while J. coordinates plans with our friends, and by the time we've reached the Airbnb, he has evening movie plans figured out and tickets bought with gift cards we had. 3 p.m. \u2014 Check into the Airbnb and I immediately lock myself in the bathroom to take the longest, hottest bath of my life while J. takes the dog on a long walk. There's a lot to love about our Seattle apartment, but the bathroom situation is not on that list. We have a small hot water heater, which means really short showers. It's good for the environment, but showering at home is not a relaxing part of my day. I luxuriate in the bath and use a toner sample from Aesop. When I finally leave the bathroom, J. puts on the  Frozen  DVD we found (it's a family-friendly Airbnb) to entertain me while I sit on the couch and do my makeup. Advertisement 5:30 p.m. \u2014 Dog is exhausted from her long day and passes out in her kennel. We always travel with it so doesn't roam around new spaces unattended. We meet friends to watch  Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri  and holy hell, it is amazing. Highly recommend. It's super cathartic to watch Frances McDormand embody this angry character who says and does whatever the hell she wants. It's not a perfect movie, but dang is it truly a movie for our times. 8 p.m. \u2014 We go to a new restaurant in town with some friends where another friend manages the bar. I get three tacos and a beer; the food is insane, the company is the best, and I never want to leave. J. and I go dutch.  $16.70 10 p.m. \u2014 Say our goodbyes and head back to the Airbnb after a busy and fun day. J. and I hang out, get intimate, goof around, and just enjoy each other's company.

It's raining heavily and the park is completely empty. I feel my brain stem relax \u2013 this solitude is impossible to find in Seattle. We hike the trails and enjoy the quiet, the rain, and the mud. Advertisement 10 a.m. \u2014 We get home and clean up. I start packing up the Airbnb and a friend texts me for a spontaneous coffee date. The dog has passed out in her kennel, so I leave her a Kong and go see my friend. She buys coffee for both of us and we catch up. 11:30 a.m. \u2014 Head back to the Airbnb and finish packing up before checking out and heading back home. We drive through Starbucks on the way and I get egg-white bites. J. treats. I'm crying a little about having to leave my friends and the town I love. 1:30 p.m. \u2014 Back in the city. We unpack and unwind on the couch a little bit, and then get intimate, which lifts my spirits greatly. We go for a run to Trader Joe's, which is a mile straight uphill, so I stretch a little before we go. The sun is shining and I need sunglasses. It feels so great to be outside, feeling healthy and using my body. At Trader Joe's we stock up on dried fruit and nuts and get sandwich fixings for dinner. J. pays. 2 p.m. \u2014 We walk back to the apartment, but I continue on foot to the co-op to buy spinach, tomatoes, tangerines, two grapefruits, a bottle of wine, a chocolate protein Odwalla, garlic-stuffed green olives, and pickled cherry peppers.  $30.71 3 p.m. \u2014 Get home and feel motivated to do a Gorilla Workout. The workouts on this app are super well-designed; I highly recommend it for something cheaper than a gym membership that you can do in a small apartment. I focus on time and can generally complete one workout in 15 minutes. I get this one done in 10 and am immediately starving afterward, so I snack on olives and cheese. Advertisement 5 p.m. \u2014 J. makes sandwiches for dinner while I jump in the shower with a glass of wine. I've actually gotten pretty good at three-minute showering, and it's just fine for a quick rinse after a workout. Then I hype myself up for a phone call with my mom. My relationship with her is not very good, and the phone convo produces a lot of material that I mentally file away for my next therapy appointment in a couple of days. 8 p.m. \u2014 I do my evening skincare routine and jump into bed with my new Elena Ferrante book. I previously read  The Days of Abandonment  in one day because her style is so captivating. I'm exhausted, so I don't get too far into  My Brilliant Friend . Fall asleep with the light on and J. eventually comes to tuck me and the dog into bed.

The one I want from Target just went on sale, so I quickly order it online and also throw in a sheet mask to treat myself.  $22.87 7:05 p.m. \u2014 I call my insurance agent to find out if my car insurance will go down now that I'm 25; she tells me that it will go from $160/month to $156/month. I was expecting it to be more than that! Once B. turns 25, I hope it'll decrease even more. I know that some people don't enjoy their birthdays, but I think of it as a day all for myself. I can only assume that birthdays from here on out won't be as exciting, so I'll enjoy today while it lasts.

It's still pretty and hasn't turned to grey sludge yet. Wander around the house drinking tea, contemplating going to the gym and bothering the cats. My husband, M., suggests (read: asks until I cave) that we go out to brunch since we're clearly not going to work out. We'll be hiking through the snow as we run our errands, so that will count as exercise for the day. I spend the walk to brunch gleefully kicking fresh snow as high in the air as I can; it's deeply satisfying. Once we're there, I order the breakfast BLT (which comes with a fried egg) and duck fat fries (which are dusted in lemon zest, parsley, and parmesan), and a cup of Earl Grey. M. orders fried chicken and biscuits with sausage gravy, a coffee, and a bourbon drink with egg whites. Everything is delicious and they play great '90s music during brunch service. I have not listened to Fugees enough lately.  $58.51 Advertisement 11:30 a.m. \u2014 We head over to our favorite grocery store, which is known for absurdly cheap produce and also has a very cheap deli counter. M. picks up lunch ingredients for the week: sourdough bread, Boar's Head turkey, and muenster cheese.  $14.76 12 p.m. \u2014 While we're in the area, we stop by Home Depot to pick up a few home decor items: L brackets (two packs), two brass coat hooks, a spool of twine, and LED light bulbs that look like old-fashioned ones.  $38.47 12:30 p.m. \u2014 On the way home, we also swing by Best Buy for new surge protectors. They are not very fun but I get the one with a fabric-wrapped cord so it will be a little prettier next to our bed. It's only $2 more than the plain one. (Why are these so expensive?) We spend the rest of the day rearranging furniture, hanging things up, doing laundry, and watching pre-Super Bowl coverage. Snow days are excellent for getting the house together.  $44.08 6 p.m. \u2014 Late in the day, I stop by Aldi for a bottle of wine and a pack of chicken thighs. I'm traveling for work this week and will prep the chicken so that M. has something when he gets home from work. I picked up a pound of ground lamb at Aldi a few days ago, too, since it was such an unusual find. I roll it into patties with cumin, garlic, and harissa, and then marinate kale in lemon juice and oil. I also cook green lentils to add something a little carb-y. The recipe is loosely derived from Julia Turshen's merguez recipe in her  Small Victories  cookbook. She serves it with yogurt, and I wish I had yogurt for mine, but I don't. I marinate the chicken thighs in lemon juice, oregano, garlic, and olive oil and grill them, and then put them in a container for M. to eat this week. We eat dinner while watching the Super Bowl.  $10.19 Advertisement Daily Total: $166.01", "day_two": "Day Two: 5:30 a.m. \u2014 Mondays when I have to be onsite are rough. I get up around 4:30 a.m., double-check my packed bag, get dressed in office-appropriate clothing that is comfortable enough to fly in, and order a Lyft to O'Hare, which I expense. The lines are awful this morning since it's supposed to snow a few more inches, and seemingly everyone arrived extra early. They let me go in the pre-check line, so I get to keep my shoes on and watch the TSA K9 be a very good dog. ($28.17 expensed) 6:30 a.m. \u2014 Comfortably settled at my gate with Earl Grey from Starbucks and a protein box (apple slices, peanut butter, multigrain roll, and hard-boiled eggs; $12.15 expensed). I don't drink coffee, but I do require nearly constant tea intake. My flight only takes about 75 minutes, but we're delayed nearly 30 minutes before boarding because maintenance has to replace the carpeting in first class. I assume someone got free-drink happy on their red-eye. 9:30 a.m. \u2014 I could order a Lyft but I prefer taking the train from the airport to the office. ($4 expensed) I try to be fairly frugal when I travel on the client's dime, even though I know my average expenses are tiny compared to most consultants'. It's freezing here, but luckily my first and second trains come pretty quickly. 12 p.m. \u2014 Grab lunch across the street from the office at a cute place that has grain bowls. I get brown rice, vegetables, salmon, goat cheese, and avocado. ($15.42 expensed) It's a little under-seasoned and the salmon seems canned, but it's healthier than most other options nearby. Advertisement 6 p.m. \u2014 After leaving the office, I swing by the grocery store a short walk away. I pick up canned soup, RXBars, chocolate, and dried apricots. It's windy and cold, so I know I won't want to walk to get dinner. ($16.38 expensed) 6:30 p.m. \u2014 Take a Lyft from the store to my hotel because it's about a mile walk and I have luggage with me. ($6.52 expensed) I do a short treadmill run in the hotel's fitness center, then head back to my room to eat my soup, an RXBar, and some of the chocolate and apricots. 8:30 p.m. \u2014 I'm a bridesmaid in my brother's wedding this spring, and I need shoes. I have gotten the go-ahead email from his fianc\u00e9, so I pull the trigger before either she or I can waffle about it. Watch a lot of  House Hunters , Skype my husband for a bit, and pass out.

I also get a pot of hot tea since it is still frigid and icy out. ($16.85 expensed) 5:30 p.m. \u2014 Leave the office and walk the half mile to Target. I forgot to pack extra shirts to work out in. I comb through the clearance section and find a JoyLab top that's marked down.  $10.99 Advertisement 6 p.m. \u2014 Head across the shopping complex to Trader Joe's. Eating healthy while traveling for work is really hard. I get a $60 per day meal allowance when I travel, and at first, I was like, \"I can treat myself to dinner every night!\" \u2014 but by week two, I felt super gross. I pick up raw almonds, dried cherries, almond/toffee/chocolate bits, a frozen meal of wild salmon with orzo, zucchini, and mint sauce, a frozen beef bibimbap, two Greek yogurts, ABC+K slaw, canned tuna in olive oil, and a roasted seaweed snack. Walk back to the hotel and unload everything into the mini-fridge in my hotel room. I use the elliptical for a while, call my mom for her birthday, and then eat the frozen salmon meal, plus almonds and cherries. Catch up with my husband on Skype, and then go to bed a little early.

There's a giant snowstorm headed to Chicago and I try to move my Thursday flight earlier, but clearly many people have already done this and I'm out of luck. It's a quiet day at work. I brought a lot of my Trader Joe's groceries, so I don't need to eat out. 6 p.m. \u2014 Get back to the hotel. I run on the treadmill for a while, watch a lot of  Psych  on Amazon Prime, and pack since I'm checking out in the morning. I'm dreading travel tomorrow; I really don't want to be stuck here for the weekend because of the snow.

On the way, I obsessively check my flight on the American Airlines app \u2014\u00a0so far, so good. Snowfall is supposed to start in Chicago around 8 p.m., but there's a possibility of eight to 12 inches, so it's probably going to come down hard. If we're delayed at all, we might not make it out. ($7.03 expensed) 11:30 a.m. \u2014 I grab lunch with a friend from my company who is also working with this client. We go back to the grain bowl place. (I basically alternate between eating here and at the Vietnamese place, plus occasionally Chipotle.) I grab an Asian slaw bowl with beef. My friend is considering an assignment abroad, which I would LOVE to do, but that would mean asking M. to take a leave of absence from work, and his job is going incredibly well. ($16.31 expensed) 2 p.m. \u2014 Friend gives me a ride to the airport so I don't need to take another Lyft. After getting through security, I grab a cup of tea and a Marshmallow Dream Bar at Starbucks and settle in at my gate. My flight is still on time so far. I do more work and catch up on my personal email while I wait. I like to leave the office a little early on travel days so that I can get work done uninterrupted. ($5.86 expensed) Advertisement 5 p.m. \u2014 Well, it's two hours until our scheduled departure and the incoming flight from O'Hare is delayed by two hours. We're now scheduled to leave at 9 p.m. The ground crew isn't here yet, so there's no one to ask for details, and people are panicking. Several passengers are booking rental cars to drive instead, and a handful of people are rescheduling their flights for tomorrow morning. Chicago is only supposed to get three inches of snow tonight versus eight tomorrow, so I'm pretty sure my best chance of getting home is to hold out for the flight. The ground crew shows up about an hour later and informs us that there is a mechanical issue with the plane, so it's not a weather cancellation. I stare at the app for updates, willing the incoming flight's status to say: \"Departed.\" 8 p.m. \u2014 We are clearly the last flight in this terminal because everything is closed except Hudson News. I buy a bag of gummies to try and stay sane. M. texts me updates about the snowfall. At 8:17, the incoming flight departs! And if they can take off from Chicago, we can almost certainly land there. ($6.24 expensed) 10:30 p.m. \u2014 We are finally, finally in the air. I get free in-flight Wi-Fi through my company, so I log on and get another hour of work done from the plane. If I'm going to have a 10-hour travel day, I should be productive for some of it. Advertisement 11:45 p.m. \u2014 We land and hang out for a while as they clear a gate; the snow is coming down but not as hard as I anticipated. As soon as we start to deplane, I request a Lyft. (O'Hare makes rideshare drivers park in a lot about eight minutes away from the pickup point, so it's best to request early in case there's traffic.) The roads are awful, but fortunately, my driver is a middle-aged dad with a solid car that can handle it. I get home at about 12:15 a.m., say hi to M. and the cats, and fall asleep (in my own bed, finally!) within about 20 minutes. ($29.24 expensed) 7:30 a.m. \u2014 Get an emailed receipt from my hotel. The rate is $489.42 \u2014 slightly from January; I'll have to make sure to keep an eye on that. I put all of the expenses but airfare on my credit card and then work reimburses me, but it can take them weeks to deposit the money into my account. I still need to monitor my card balance and make sure I pay it all off on time to avoid paying interest. (Fortunately, our travel department books and pays for my flights in advance.) Daily Total: $0", "day_six": "Day Six: 8 a.m. \u2014 Haul ourselves out of bed at a reasonable time. We both work from home on Fridays, but the snow is already so deep that M.'s office is closed and he has a surprise day off! He plays video games and picks up a little around the house while I make calls and get my work done as fast as possible. I'm glad I got a few extra hours of work done at the airport last night. I fry eggs and put them over kale salad leftovers for a quick brunch to tide us over; we're going to a bar for $5 Fridays this afternoon. Advertisement 4 p.m. \u2014 $5 Friday! I'm done with work and we've hiked through about six inches of snow and slush to get to a bar near us that has good food and drink specials. I get a Tocayo and a Jameson shot ($10), and M. gets a Heineken and a Jameson shot ($10). We hang out, catching up on the little things that happened throughout the week and talking about sports news. (Jimmy Garoppolo signed a five-year deal with the 49ers, which is super exciting.) We both get the $5 cheeseburger with fries, plus an order of onion strings. These are excellent burgers for the normal price of $14, but they are REALLY excellent when they're $5. I get another Tocayo and shot and M. orders a Jameson, neat. Since I travel about half the month (sometimes more), we try to have as much fun as we can when I'm in town. This usually translates to going out for food and drinks, but once it gets warmer I'm hoping to go on hikes and day trips a bit more often too.  $71.10 7 p.m. \u2014 We hike home (it's even snowier than before!) and watch  Goodfellas . I've never seen the whole movie and M. recently texted me \"Jimmyyyyyyyyy!\" (like Ray Liotta screams in the movie) to celebrate the 49ers news. The soundtrack is one of the best in any of Scorsese's films. We follow it up with  Jackie Brown  because we're in the mood to keep watching movies with great music, and it's fun to watch a totally different De Niro character. By the time both movies end, I'm exhausted and still a little buzzed. I don't drink while I'm onsite, so my tolerance is not terribly high. Roll into bed and pass out.

I run on the treadmill and I'm feeling good, so I keep pushing it and pushing it, until suddenly I have to puke. I feel totally fine after I get the food out of my stomach. I think the final pace increase was just a little too much. 9:30 a.m. \u2014 On the way home from the gym, we stop by Walgreens and get a bottle of cheap wine. I sit on the couch for a while, drinking water and ginger tea, until my stomach feels settled enough to eat an RXBar.  $5.07 10:30 a.m. \u2014 I go to Aldi to get our groceries for the week. I love Aldi so, so much. This one opened super close to us last year, and I'm there at least three to four times a week. I pick up chicken thighs, canned chickpeas, salad greens, eggs, cilantro, green onions, broccoli, coffee, a cucumber, pita chips, a four-pound boneless pork loin, sweet potatoes, a sleeve of three garlic heads, and an avocado. Less than $40! Insane. We deep clean the house, scrubbing all the salt tracks off the floor and vacuuming up all the cat hair. I'm so happy that I'll be home all next week. I miss cooking so much when I'm on the road, and since running and cooking are my major anxiety relievers, my mental health suffers without them too. I make a batch of herbed chickpeas (an Alison Roman recipe from  Bon App\u00e9tit ) with cilantro, parsley, and mint, and eat a small bowl of them with Greek yogurt for lunch.  $35.96 Advertisement 4 p.m. \u2014 Taking a break to browse the Internet. I'm searching for a pair of work shoes I got at Marshalls last year that are super worn down and need replacing. Magically, I find them at Sierra Trading Company on clearance and grab the last pair in my size. I also pick up Merino wool socks and M. adds a pair of Reebok sweats to the purchase.  $68.99 5:30 p.m. \u2014 I'm feeling a little stir crazy with all the snow, so we bundle up and walk a few blocks to a great cocktail bar and restaurant nearby. I order a drink with mezcal, ginger, honey and lemon, and M. gets one with bourbon, port wine, lemon, and seltzer. When they arrive, we try both and immediately swap. This happens a lot. We hang out for a while, debriefing the Olympics and people-watching.  $34.73 6:30 p.m. \u2014 Get home from the bar and put Olympic figure skating on. Very excited to watch Adam Rippon and the Shib sibs. I marinate the chicken thighs in sugar, garlic, ginger, scallions, gochujang, soy sauce, and sesame oil, and then simmer them in a pan with water until the sauce thickens. I also cut a third of the cucumber into thin slices and pickle it in sugar, salt, rice vinegar, and sesame oil. I take out some Chinese bao buns from the freezer and steam them until they're puffy, then smear them with mayo and stuff with the chicken thighs and cucumbers. We eat the bao in front of the TV. The food is delicious. And Adam Rippon was robbed.

I shower quickly before taking my dog to my parents' house, which is five minutes away. I shamelessly use them for doggy daycare on a daily basis. My dog gets to play and nap with our family dog all day, and I don't have to pay for daycare (plus I frequently get free breakfast and/or dinner out of the arrangement). It's a win-win-win situation. I stop at the grocery store after dropping off my dog to get apples, almond and peanut butter, yogurt, cereal, almonds, protein bars, kombucha, and other snacks for work.  $14.78 8 a.m. \u2014 I'm the first person in my department to arrive at work, so I have more time to sort through my hefty inbox and do a couple of personal things online. I bought two pairs of shoes from Zappos last week to wear to a friend's recent bachelorette party in New Orleans, knowing I'd end up returning one. I print that return slip and then call my primary care doctor to get a prescription for oral steroids. I'm super sensitive to cigarette smoke and NOLA has pervasive wafts of it. I could barely breathe in spin class last night and I started having chest pain. When that happens, my asthma meds aren't enough to open up my lungs, and I have to go on oral steroids for a couple of days. Advertisement 12 p.m. \u2014 I send video clips of myself lifting this morning to my personal trainer and email him the tally of my February lifts. I started working with a personal trainer last April as a way to strengthen my joints. I've had several surgeries through the years after playing soccer competitively in college, and lifting again keeps me from getting re-injured. I feel like the resulting improvements in my confidence, self-esteem, and strength justify the cost. A lot of people design their own lifting programs or do stuff like BBG, but I have very specific needs and limitations and working with a trainer is a much more comfortable fit for me. 3:30 p.m. \u2014 Work is very busy today. It seems like all of our salespeople decided to need things as soon as I left last Friday. I sort through my inbox and prioritize projects with my supervisor. Because I don't usually take a lunch break, I can leave early some days (especially every other Tuesday when I go to therapy). I eat an apple and almond butter, yogurt, and a protein bar throughout the day, drinking plenty of water too, and take some Do-si-dos from the front mail room. They're usually one of the first boxes to disappear during Girl Scout cookie season, and they're a nice treat when I want something sweet. I leave work at 5:15 and call my sister on the way to the polling station to vote in the primaries, and I take my dog to the dog park after voting. Advertisement 7 p.m. \u2014 I drop off the dog at my apartment and start a load of laundry before heading back to the grocery store to pick up toilet paper, cat food, sweet potatoes, Lean Pockets, spinach, eggs, and beans ($98.99), as well as my prescriptions. I'm still on my mom's insurance until I can afford my medications \u2013 I'm on a lot of very expensive ones to help moderate the more prevalent of my autism manifestations. Today, I pick up my birth control, thyroid medication, anti-anxiety medication, and the oral steroid my doctor called in. (It's a $30 total co-pay that I pay for with my flex spending account card.)

Then I head to my parents' house at 6:20 to drop off my dog. I start my steroid prescription, and holy shit, after only one dose I can feel my lungs really opening up. Drugs are awesome. I arrive at work at 7:45, and we have a new hire interview at 9 (someone to share some of the conference scheduling and admin burden with me). The candidate is woefully unprepared and inappropriately dressed, so we go with a different candidate, who will start tomorrow. Advertisement 3:30 p.m. \u2014 I finally start looking at receipts from the bachelorette party weekend. So much money on ride-sharing! Mostly solo trips, since I did some excursions by myself and left Bourbon Street earlier than the others. I start a Google Sheet to keep track of what I paid and what I owe. Three of the four girls end up owing me a total of $74.90, so I send the totals out on the group chat and they Venmo me their shares. I owe the other girl $17.18. She doesn't have Venmo, so I write her a check that I'll give her when I see her this weekend for dinner with the bride and her maid of honor (who couldn't make the trip).  $17.18 4 p.m. \u2014 Our  Bachelor  bracket commissioner sends a memo reminding us to pay. I came in dead last, but fortunately, we don't have punishments like in Fantasy Football leagues. I Venmo her $5 for my shameful performance. After a packed day today and yesterday, I take the last hour of the day to clear my Gmail inbox; my Atlas Obscura, Refinery29, Countable, JSTOR Daily, and alumni emails have piled up since last week. I tinker with an inventory spreadsheet while watching Beauty With Mi and Sweet Digs videos on Refinery29. A $104 refund for dresses from Lulus comes through. I bought two in the hopes that I'd be able to wear them on the trip, but one looked cheap and the other was too big in the boob area.  $5 Advertisement 5 p.m. \u2014 Finish a busy day and head to the spin studio for a 5:30 class. I'm confident I'll be able to go harder today now that my lungs are less compromised. After spin, I check dating apps. I made a new rule for myself that I can't look at dating apps unless it's after a workout. This really keeps my mindless swiping addiction in check and my confidence high. I check my mail on the way back to my apartment and find an invitation to my cousin's baby shower, my Dollar Shave Club shipment, and a reimbursement check for my cat's vet visit a couple of weeks ago. I text my cousin to let her know I'll be at the shower in a few weeks and mobile deposit my reimbursement check ($275.48). I shower and change before going to pick up my dog and have dinner with my mom. 9 p.m. \u2014 After dinner, I go home with my dog. I'm a little hyper from the steroids, but I don't want to commit to chores and risk a later bedtime, so I brush my teeth, walk my dog, and read  The   Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy  for 10 minutes or so before falling asleep.

I get a Chinese chicken salad and eat half of it; I don't want to be too weighed down in spin class this evening. 12:30 p.m. \u2014 I'm trying to finish up a large project for a client, but I'm already sleepy from lunch. I grab a bottle of GT's Kombucha Lemonade from my grocery store run. The little caffeine boost and bubbles help keep me awake. I remember to plug in my Fitbit Flex 2. (If your activity's not on your activity tracker, did you really even do it?) I also go ahead and cough up the registration fee for my high-school reunion next month. I don't really want to go, but the girl who planned it lives in my apartment complex and really wants me to. I've changed since high school, so maybe everyone else has, too. Plus, the school's paying for the alcohol and ride shares, which is nice.  $30 Advertisement 2:30 p.m. \u2014 Refill my water bottle. I drink 96 to 120 ounces of water during work, which keeps me hydrated and awake and also lets me get up and walk every couple hours. I register for a free yoga class that one of my favorite spin instructors/buddies is teaching in a couple of weeks. I never do yoga, and it's on a Sunday (I usually don't spend Sundays around humans) but I want to support him! 5 p.m. \u2014 Spin time! The instructor is injured, so I'm encouraged to ride the instructor bike in his place. I've been doing spin classes consistently for three years, but I've always been terrified of the instructor bike because being in front of crowds with eyes on me is a personal nightmare. I don't have enough time to think about it and be scared, so I go up there and it is amazing! I have the best time. Who knows, maybe I'll be a teacher someday... 7:45 p.m. \u2014 My mom is picking up the dogs from the vet, so I have to wait for her to come home with them before I can leave. I help feed both dogs when they're back but I'm not really hungry, so I decline my parents' invitation to stay for dinner. I go back to my apartment, still grinning from spin this evening. I spread peanut butter on a Kodiak Cake and take my meds. My dog and I are in bed by 9 and asleep by 9:45 after a nice chunk of  Hitchhiker's .

I snooze until 5:45, then brush my teeth, take my asthma meds, wash my face, and moisturize. Dog is still asleep at 6:15 when I pull the covers back to wake him up! We pack up and go to my parents' house, and after a nice long walk with my mom and the dog, I swing by Smoothie King on my way to work. I usually reserve JuiceLand and Smoothie King runs for rewards after early-morning lifts, but I'm feeling peckish, so I get a Lean 1 smoothie.  $6.50 9:30 a.m. \u2014 It's inventory photo day! Taking inventory photos is one of my favorite parts of my job. I get to go play with old records, read them, and photograph them. Today, we don't have anything super interesting but sometimes I get fascinating stuff, like old murders and bizarre legal cases. I show our new hire how to take archival \"before\" photos. By 11:30, I'm back to my desk to tackle quotes. I grab the rest of the kombucha I started yesterday and a Siggi's yogurt I bought last week. I skim a JSTOR Daily interview with Steven Pinker and pop over to Goodreads to add a couple of his books to my \"To Read\" list. I'm always looking for books to add to my list, especially from unfamiliar areas. Advertisement 1:30 p.m. \u2014 My leftover Chinese chicken salad from yesterday has congealed into an unappetizing lump in the to-go container. I toss it and grab the last of my apples from my desk, which I eat with Justin's Honey Almond Butter. I finish up a few quotes and read some  Public Domain Review  articles. The deviation from my morning lift routine, leftover energy from last night's spin, and steroids opening up my lungs have me itching to go for a run after work. At 3, we have a meeting to discuss a massive project for one of our biggest clients. And then at 4, I review a proof I designed for one of our records management systems. 5:15 p.m. \u2014 I leave for the day and chat with my sister on the way to my gym, where I go for a quick run. Afterward, I hit the dog park with the dog and then stop by Trader Joe's for tortilla chips to snack on while I cook and clean tonight. I try to spend Fridays recuperating from my weekly responsibilities by cleaning, doing laundry, and cooking. I'm in bed by 9:30 and read  Hitchhiker's  before falling asleep.  $5.38 Daily Total: $11.88", "day_five": "Day Five: 10:45 a.m. \u2014 I sleep in a little, then get up, brush my teeth, wash and moisturize my face, and get my workout clothes on. I grab a sleeve of Clif Bloks for carbs and caffeine and take my Saturday walk with the dog and both parents. It's a great way to catch up with both of them. Then it's time for spin. After a great class, I meet my parents, my cousin, and his family for brunch. I decide to run there because my GPS says it's only a mile from my apartment. False \u2014 it's a solid two miles. Exhausted, I change shirts at the restaurant and join my family. I order tomato pasta with grilled chicken and my cousin snags the bill before my dad. I don't usually like kids, but my cousin's kids are pretty cool. Advertisement 5:30 p.m. \u2014 I spend a relaxing afternoon at my apartment with the dog. I'm meeting my friends for dinner tonight and decide to go to the restaurant early for a drink. Not only does drinking lessen my social anxiety, but it actually reduces the effects of external stimuli for me, making me less overwhelmed. My friends trickle in, and I put their drinks on my tab. I'm pretty sure I still owe them from NOLA even though we settled up earlier this week.  $38.93 9 p.m. \u2014 We finish up our dinner. I had a 25% off coupon for our whole party, and the waitress forgets to apply it. I remind her about it and she brings new checks. It's great seeing everyone, even though I just spent the weekend with them.  $28 9:30 p.m. \u2014 The bride and maid of honor head home, and the other girls and I go across the street to a pub to hang out. I get a PBR to sip while we chat before leaving at 10:30. I contemplate going back out, but by the time I get home to my dog, I don't really feel like it. I crawl into bed by 11:30.  $4 Daily Total: $70.93", "day_six": "Day Six: 7 a.m. \u2014 The alarm hurts this morning. Daylight Saving has started, so instead of seven and a half hours of sleep, I get six and a half. I take my dog for a short walk with my mom. Sometimes I don't take my stimulant medication on Sundays so I can sleep more. It's not great to skip it, but the medication is really expensive and I can make the prescription last longer if I skip odd days. I take a long morning nap and then go for another walk with the dog at 11:30. Advertisement 12:30 p.m. \u2014 My alma mater's men's basketball team is playing in the conference championship today, but I decide to watch at home instead of going to the watch party. I had my fill of socializing last night, so I watch while I clean and vacuum. I do some serious stretching too. The run after spin class yesterday left me more sore than normal. Huzzah, we win! March Madness will be a little more exciting with my alma mater still in the running. After the game, the dog and I go for another walk. Then the dog takes a nap and I settle into my reading chair to finish  The Kremlin's Candidate . I loved the first two books in  The Red Sparrow  trilogy, but I'm taking longer than normal to finish this book. It just doesn't grip me as much as the last ones did. 6 p.m. \u2014 I boil pasta with tomato sauce and spinach for dinner and then finally finish the book. I cried a little at the end \u2013 one of those: \"It had to end this way, but it's still sad\" conclusions. I take the dog for another walk and turn on  Archer , do a clay mask, and shower to cheer myself up before bed. I'm in bed by 9:30, but my brain won't settle down, so I read  Hitchhiker's  until 9:50 before falling asleep. Daily Total: $0", "day_seven": "Day Seven: 6 a.m. \u2014 Up at 6. Losing an hour to Daylight Saving Time is killing me. I know a lot of people like it, but the hour time change and extra light at night are really hard for me. Light is one of my biggest autistic sensitivities. I usually have to bring hats and sunglasses with me all the time since it's bright so late now. Dog and I head to my parents' house at 6:45. I read theSkimm while he and our family dog eat breakfast, and then we go for a morning walk. I stop by the grocery store at 8 for apples, a bottle of kombucha, and cereal. It's going to be a caffeine day today. I get to work a little late, start up my computer, and get water and Earl Grey going. Hopefully, my brain starts working soon.  $11.59 Advertisement 12:30 p.m. \u2014 I eat a protein bar from my desk, which makes me surprisingly full, and call in more prescription refills that I can pick up after work. By 3:30, I'm hungry again, so I eat one of my apples with honey almond butter as a pre-workout snack. I leave promptly at 5 today. I can't wait for spin at 6:30 when I can get some endorphins. I feel much better after my hard workout, but I don't have the energy to pick up my meds, so I'll do that tomorrow. I shower and go to my parents' house to get my dog and eat a little. We're back home by 8, and I brush my teeth, take my meds, and hop in bed by 8:45. I read  Hitchhiker's  for a bit and fall asleep with my dog.

(Side note: Even though we're engaged, I usually just refer to him as my boyfriend.) He jumps straight out of bed (how?) and potters around getting ready. I promptly go back to sleep. Say goodbye to him, then snooze for a little bit longer. 10:30 a.m. \u2014 I justify sleeping this late because I'm fighting off a near-constant sinus infection. For breakfast I have a bowl of overnight oats, which I make in bulk most weekends. This week's huge batch contains blueberries, bananas, chia seeds, oats, coconut yoghurt, almond milk, and leftover flax seeds. I eat while sitting in front of my SAD lamp (for Seasonal Affective Disorder).  I'm prone to Vitamin D-deficiency, so I've borrowed my mum's light to see if it helps me feel better in the winter. Advertisement 11 a.m. \u2014 Today is Book Day. Most weeks, I work on a self-imposed schedule of three days freelance copywriting followed by two days of work on my novel. Without it, it can be all too easy to neglect the novel, as it (currently) doesn't make me any money. This week, I moved my book days to the beginning so that I can work on sending chapters to an agent before the end of the month \u2013 eek! Before I start, though, I have a bit of wedmin (wedding admin) to do. My boyfriend and I have been engaged for five-and-a-half years and have finally decided to get the wedding ball rolling. I bought a dress last week, and we're trying to tie down a venue now. 2 p.m. \u2014 Time has seriously run away from me. After some heavy wedmin, a chat on the phone with my mum, and lunch consisting of a big bowl of roasted veggies, quinoa, and hummus (homemade in bulk; our hummus consumption is too vast to justify buying it), I finally make my way into my pseudo-office. Then, I Uber to the dry cleaners with the aforementioned wedding dress. (It was a sample sale purchase, so it was recommended that I get it cleaned).  $16.36 3 p.m. \u2014 Get to the dry cleaners and it turns out it's going to cost over $190 for the clean! This is more than double what the bridal store estimated, but I saved so much on the dress that it should still work out as a good deal over all. I hand over my card, feeling a little sick and a little too flustered to question the cost. On the way out, I decide I'll bring it up when I collect the dress.  $196 Advertisement 3:30 p.m. \u2014 Stop to grab coffees for me and my boyfriend. I get access to the shared workspace that I use as an office through his work (and it's free!), and his office happens to be in the same building. We chat for a couple of minutes after I give him the coffee, and then I settle in for some writing while munching on a homemade cookie. (I used a cookie recipe from Lucy Watson's cookbook and was initially skeptical of buying a cookbook written by a reality TV star, but these cookies are SO GOOD. They're vegan but they don't taste it).  $7 6 p.m. \u2014 Multiple breaks throughout the afternoon for snacks (lentil chips and then peanut butter and banana) and random internet browsing. 6:45 p.m. \u2014 Meet my friend for salsa class. We signed up a few weeks ago, inspired by our New Year's resolutions. As a socially awkward person with no coordination, dance class is a challenge for me, plus it's an additional expense, but it's good for my mental health. It's actually quite fun and I get see to see my friend on a weekly basis, which is lovely. I have a splitting headache when I arrive but hope I'll forget about it once we start. 8:30 p.m. \u2014 Head home after an hour of dancing very close to people I don't know and making awkward small talk with a fellow classmate. Still, it was fun and my headache is gone. My friend and I walk to the Tube while discussing how nice it is to spend time in class where you can't check your phone or really think about anything other than the choreography. We hug and make plans to hang out in a week or so. I spend the rest of the journey thinking about the bagel I'm going to make when I get home while also indulging my inner emo teenager by listening to 30 Seconds To Mars. (I recently discovered I love them. Jared Leto is a beautiful man. I have no shame.)  $8 Advertisement 9:30 p.m. \u2014 I mooch about the house while I wait for my boyfriend to get back from football \u2013 I said I'd wait for him to eat, as he hasn't had dinner yet either. Chuck a load of washing in and feed Gerty, my sourdough starter. We were given a sourdough class for Christmas, and it was there that Gerty was born. For the next week, I have to feed it water and flour before I can use it (her? - the teacher heavily anthropomorphized her own starter, and now I feel the need to as well) to bake. My boyfriend gets home and we have bagels \u2014 his with avocado and goat's curd, and mine with avocado and vegan cream cheese. We watch old episodes of  Travel Man  while we polish off the last of the cookies, and then get to bed around 11.

Our sourdough starters have doubled in size overnight and look like tiny bready monsters. He leaves, and I eat oats for breakfast while watching  Friends . Spend the morning reading up on the best way to approach agents for my novel. 11 a.m. \u2014 Grab a quick shower and douse myself in the last of the Glossier perfume tester I had. Fortuitously, it arrived just as I ran out of my regular perfume. It's cheaper than my usual and smells lovely, so I decide to order a full bottle online.  $63 Advertisement 12:30 p.m. \u2014 Another portion of roasted veggies, quinoa and hummus for lunch. Watch another episode of  Friends , then do a quick Headspace meditation. (I can keep my anxiety much more under control if I meditate everyday.) Check the sourdough starters and notice Gerty is bursting out of her plastic container. Hurriedly transfer her into a bigger jar before she explodes everywhere. 1 p.m. \u2014 Wander to my favourite coffee shop and am chuffed to get my usual seat, nestled away in a little nook at the back. Order a coffee which comes with a biscuit (this place is the best), and get to work on editing and writing. I was planning to contact book agents soon, but all the advice I read earlier has convinced me of the need to do one more, fine-tooth comb-through of my book before sending the first chapters off.  $3.40 3:30 p.m. \u2014 Starting to get peckish. The cafe doesn't have any vegan cakes, so I panic and order another coffee I don't really need just so I can have the biscuit. Fun fact: Lotus biscuits are vegan. (I'm not strictly vegan but have noticed my skin and mental health are better when I avoid dairy, so I tend to follow a vegan diet most of the time.)  $3.40 4:10 p.m. \u2014 My attention is lagging a little. I'm trying very hard not to just rewrite everything in the book, which is what I've done on each of my previous three edits. I decide to get my second coffee to-go to have tomorrow and then head home. On the way, I stop at a bookstore to do research \u2013 I want to have a look at how successful fantasy authors start their books and to get an idea of how long their chapters are. I spend a bit of time flicking through some novels, including  A   Game of Thrones , and my absolute favourite fantasy series,  The Farseer Trilogy  by Robin Hobb. Reading Hobb was what inspired me to finally start working on my own book, so looking over her first trilogy now is oddly nostalgic and emotional. Advertisement 5 p.m. \u2014 Snack on homemade rye bread with a little vegan cream cheese while I watch  Friends . Almost immediately cut another slice and have it with honey. Finish with a few lentil chips. Spend an hour or so on the phone with my mum and then my nan. 7 p.m. \u2014 Boyfriend texts to say he's on his way home and inquires about our dinner plans. Usually, on nights when he's home a little later, it's my turn to cook \u2013 and vice versa. Our weekly Gousto box arrived earlier today so we have three meals to choose from, but I'm beginning to feel pretty tired, so I suggest leftovers. I lie around until he gets home, and then we snack on rye bread with a yummy sheep's cheese. Feel a little better after eating. 9 p.m. \u2014 Remember we need to feed the sourdough starters. I do so while wishing Gerty was actually a small fluffy animal instead of a jar full of fermenting yeast, but you can't have everything. 11 p.m. \u2014 I go to bed but feel surprisingly awake. I want to read but I know I'll get sucked in and not be able to stop. Manage to resist the urge, toss and turn for a bit, eventually fall asleep, and end up dreaming about the book I didn't read. Daily Total: $69.80", "day_three": "Day Three: 6 a.m. \u2014 My boyfriend's alarm goes off at an unholy hour, but I barely even register it. All I notice is the vague buzzing of the sound trying to break into my comfy-ness and the fact that it's still dark outside. I'm pretty sure he showers, but either he's gotten very good at getting ready quietly or I've gotten great at sleeping through the noises, as I hear nothing. Advertisement 10 a.m. \u2014 I set my alarm for 9 but inexplicably end up snoozing for an extra hour. Prat about on my phone for a bit, then get up. Breakfast is oats and SAD light (again) while watching  Friends . Then, I decide I'm going to work on my book. Technically, it should be a freelance day, but I'm waiting on work requests from my clients so I don't have any projects to work on right now. I could (and probably should) use the time to look for other work, but I'm feeling in the flow with my novel and want to try and power through as much as possible. I'll make up for it with an extra day of freelancing next week. 12 p.m. \u2014 Quick break to speak to my nan. She rings up to very kindly offer to pay for my wedding dress. I absolutely wish I could refuse all offers of help for things like this, as I'm very grateful for all my family has done for me and would like to be in the position to give them something back, but unfortunately, my boyfriend and I don't have the money to pay for everything wedding-related ourselves. I try to refuse my nan's offer, but she insists. I'm very grateful and promise her a big hug at the weekend. 1 p.m. \u2014 Decide it's probably time to get dressed. I'm going out to dinner tonight with my boyfriend and his coworkers, so I decide to wear a green & Other Stories dress I got a couple of Christmases ago. I love this dress but don't wear it that much, as it always needs ironing and I'm very lazy. I get out the ironing board and whiz the iron over while I talk to my mum on the phone about plans for this weekend; we're visiting her and my dad while also checking out a couple of potential wedding venues. Then I make a bagel with vegan cream cheese and avocado for lunch, being very careful not to spill on my newly ironed dress, before getting back to writing. Advertisement 2:30 p.m. \u2014 Coffee break. Dress is creased. Already. What even is the point of ironing? Urgh. Make a coffee using my Nespresso \u2013 I usually brew with a V60, but I'm out of beans so I have to go with my backup. Take a quick online survey to try and qualify for paid market research. I do these as often as I can, as you can get paid over $70 for them, which is a great supplement to my freelance income. 5:30 p.m. \u2014 Do a quick meditation, then have a ten-minute rest before heading out to get the train to Central London. Meeting my boyfriend at his office.  $3.65 6:30 p.m. \u2014 It's freezing! We walk from the office to a cute, gastropub-type place that sources its meat and fish locally. Get to know boyfriend's colleagues over bread and wine, then I have a starter of halloumi and butternut squash followed by pollock. Boyfriend has rabbit mac and cheese to start, then shares a colossal steak with one of his coworkers. The food is yummy but I start to feel sick halfway through my main (what is wrong with me at the moment?), so I get the rest in a box to take home.  $107.80 9:30 p.m. \u2014 We head to a nearby cocktail bar with a speakeasy vibe that is nestled among a bunch of townhouses. The fresh air makes me feel better and much less sick. I have a rum and lime concoction followed by a smoky, barrel-aged rum drink that I order mostly for the smell. Boyfriend has two of the smoky ones, followed by half of mine, as I start feeling sick again.  $71.56 Advertisement 10:30 p.m. \u2014 It's cold and dark so my boyfriend decides he wants to Uber home. He puts it on his credit card. We get back and I remember I was wearing foundation, so I have to pay more attention to removing all my makeup. Before my boyfriend passes out, we discuss the fact that we've spent quite a lot of money. It isn't ideal, but it was a special occasion, as one of the girls who was at dinner is relocating at the end of this week and we both think it's really important to make time for friends. Plus, we don't do it that often. Daily Total: $183.01", "day_four": "Day Four: 10 a.m. \u2014 Usual routine of waking up, saying bye to my boyfriend, then conking out again. Really must get out of this habit. I eventually drag myself out of my warm bed and make porridge for breakfast. Given my odd, sick-y feeling, I decide to just leave it plain. 1 p.m. \u2014 Have a hectic morning trying to organise bits and bobs, including a potential Secret Cinema trip with a group of friends. The only tickets available are $110 a pop, which seems far too steep. I leave it and lament the time wasted. I accept that it's going to be one of those days where I don't have time to get much done, especially given we'll be driving down to my parents' house later. Have a quick lunch of peanut butter on a wholemeal bagel, a stick of vegan cheese, and freshly ground (by me) coffee in front of the SAD lamp. Then I jump on the train.  $5.89 Advertisement 3:20 p.m. \u2014 I pop into my boyfriend's office to meet the most adorable little puppy who belongs to a coworker. I want to take him home, even though he threatens to snag my cosy jumper with his tiny teeth. Grab a coffee ($3.40) as I can't be arsed to grind any more beans when I get home, then head to the dry cleaners' to collect my wedding dress. The nice man working there assures me I didn't overpay and shows me the prices of a few other comparable dresses. Grab an Uber to avoid getting my newly-cleaned dress all grimey from the Tube, and am home $17.20 later (this'll go onto the wedding budget eventually, as it's technically a related expense).  $20.60 5 p.m. \u2014 Get in an hour or so of writing before my boyfriend arrives home. Quickly pack far too many items of clothing for a long weekend, and jump in the car to set off. 7 p.m. \u2014 Feels like we've been driving for yeaaaaars. London traffic is the worst. Stop to get food  and we share vegetarian nachos with beans, cheese, and guac and veggie chili from one of the service station shops. Not great, but not as horrible as I expected ($10.79). I also grab a bag of my absolute favourite car snacks, spiral salt and vinegar crisps from M&S, along with a bottle of water, as we've drunk the one we filled up ($3.44). Boyfriend claims to hate the crisps but helps me demolish them within five minutes. We won't make it all the way to Devon on the petrol we have but don't want to pay for a whole tank at extortionate service prices, so we fill up enough to get us there ($28.06).  $42.29 Advertisement 10 p.m. \u2014 Finally arrive at my parent's house. They greet us in a flurry of excitement and immediately whisk me upstairs so I can show them my wedding dress. We chill and catch up for a little bit but everyone's tired, so we head to bed around 11.

I feel absolutely horrendous, and am not sure if it's a hangover from last night's anxiety or something physical. The joys of GAD. I manage one piece of buttered toast for breakfast and my lovely mum packs me one for later. Quickly feed Gerty (yes, we're the people who carry our sourdough starters around the country), dump half a can of dried shampoo over my head, and we're out the door by 8:30. 8:45 p.m. \u2014 Stop for petrol at Tesco as we have a voucher, but my boyfriend pays at the pump and forgets to use it \u2013 whoops! We get on the road properly and I attempt to sleep off whatever it is that's ailing me. I wake up feeling better, and eat the piece of toast Mum packed for me.  $69.47 10:45 p.m. \u2014 Cornwall is so pretty! We make our way down windy little roads and through cute villages to the first of the wedding venues we're viewing today. It's an impressive-looking country house with a driveway a mile long, and we're suitably wowed. There's even an old Georgian bathhouse to have the ceremony in. The inside isn't as nice as the outside, though, and it's a little more expensive than we first thought it would be, so we leave with a lot to think about. Drive through the deer park(!) on the way out, and coo over all the sweet animals. Advertisement 12 p.m. \u2014 Quick lunch before our next viewing. We're both starving and find a pub just off the main road. I get a winter club sandwich, which consists of turkey, bacon, cheese, stuffing, and cranberry sauce (goodbye Veganism), and my boyfriend gets a pork bap \u2013 plus we share chips.  $25.96 1:45 p.m. \u2014 The next place we're viewing is an actual working farm, complete with chickens, pigs, and cows. We're shown the venue, plus the two barns which would be used on the day, and are told that all of the food would be made in-house using ingredients that are grown or bred on the farm. It's beautiful and has a really nice, homey vibe that really suits us. My boyfriend is sold and totally in love with it, and after a little discussion, I agree. We're quite budget-conscious too, and it would be a bargain for a last-minute, midweek date in September. 3 p.m. \u2014 We stop and grab a coffee to-go, plus a bottle of water. We decide to text our closest friends and make sure they're free on the date we're considering for the farm wedding, and I email the venue to provisionally hold it.  $4.63 5 p.m. \u2014 Back home! I'm supposed to be taking part in a paid research interview online, but I dial into it only to be told it's cancelled. Luckily, they tell me they'll still pay me the full compensation, which is a massive bonus. 6 p.m. \u2014 We spend the evening chatting to my parents about the venue and discussing plans/ideas for the wedding in general. It's all becoming very real, very fast! We get fish and chips from the local chippy, which has recently been named best in the U.K. (apparently). Parents very kindly pay. We all conk out at around 11.

No petrol needed this time! 12:30 p.m. \u2014 Get to my nan's and everyone is famished. She makes us ham and cheese rolls with leftover Christmas chutney and we devour them. Then, it's time to show her the wedding dress. She approves, which I'm very pleased about. We have a lot of strong, fierce women on my mum's side of the family and we're all very close, so she will likely be involved in the wedding almost as much as my mum will be. 2 p.m. \u2014 There's a mother-of-the-bride shop that we've always admired quite close to my nan's house, so we decide to head over for a browse, now that we're actually planning a wedding. We meet my two cousins there, along with their other nan who is basically part of our family. There are loads of amazing things in the store, and we dash around pulling out dresses for my mum and nan to try. Mum isn't feeling it, but my nan gets the most gorgeous beaded, Art Deco-style dress that looks like it's made for her. We all get a bit teary, and I take the opportunity to ask my cousins to be bridesmaids. I don't have any siblings, and, as I said, our family is quite close, so they're probably the nearest people I have to sisters.

Everyone except me gets hot chocolate, and I have a peppermint tea. My cousins' other nan sneakily pays and I give her all the change I have to cover my and my mum's drinks.  $4.21 6 p.m. \u2014 We get home, show my dad and boyfriend my nan's dress, and then my boyfriend and I Facetime his parents to tell them about the quickly moving plans. (When I started this Money Diary, I did not expect it to essentially become a diary of wedding planning!) My youngest cousin and her new boyfriend arrive, and we all decide to order Indian food. My boyfriend and I get vegetable biryani, aubergine, cauliflower and mushroom bhajis, and peshwari naan to share. It's really yummy. Mum and dad pay, and I intend to pay them back for our share but totally forget to mention it. Will have to message them and transfer the money. 11 p.m. \u2014 After more chatting, it's bedtime.

She's in the back of the car, which is basically a fridge anyway. Advertisement 12 p.m. \u2014 Everyone is coming over for lunch today. My two cousins, the one boyfriend, and the additional nan all arrive, and we sit down to a roast featuring the biggest joint of beef I've ever seen. My parents actually got it for Christmas, but we had so much food then that it ended up in the freezer. I load up a plate with veggies, beef, and the all important Yorkshire puds. We follow it with three types of dessert: toffee pavlova roulade, lemon meringue pie, and Viennetta, all with ice cream. I roll away from the table feeling stuffed. 3:30 p.m. \u2014 We catch up more over coffee, then get back on the road to head back to London. We fill up with petrol (again), and I grab a packet of crisps because I'm a greedy monster. Stop for a wee halfway through the journey and manage not to buy any snacks.  $55.87 6:30 p.m. \u2014 We go straight to our friends' house and I promptly put on PJs; usually I'd go for tracksuit bottoms but all I have are PJs from the weekend. Plus, we all lived together at university and visit one another's house on an almost weekly basis, so the time for dressing up has long since passed. I help one of the guys make bread-and-butter pudding while the others decide to order Japanese food. I realise I've eaten more takeout than not this week, which is definitely not usual. My boyfriend and I order California rolls, vegetable dumplings, prawn Katsu rolls, and tuna maki to share. One of the guys pays and will put our share on Splitwise, the app we use to keep track of monies within the group. We'll either pay it later or it'll cancel out against something else we've paid for. We end up severely under-ordering and are very grateful for the huge helping of bread-and-butter pudding we have for dessert. 11 p.m. \u2014 We play board games after dinner. Between us all in this group, we probably own over 50 of them. Tonight, we play the next installment of Pandemic Legacy Season 2, a game that continues on each time you play. When we're finished, we drive back to our place with one of the guys in tow \u2013 he and my boyfriend are planning to watch the Super Bowl. I potter around, unpacking a little and transferring Gerty to the fridge, and consider joining them. Watch for ten minutes before I decide I'm too knackered, and I end up going to bed around midnight. 4 a.m. \u2014 Boyfriend comes in after the Super Bowl is over and our friend has Ubered home. He sets an alarm for 10, which I think is somewhat ambitious, and I decide I'm very glad I didn't stay up watching the game.

My late start really got me in gear for the day. I feel like being late to work motivates me to get shit done more efficiently than when I'm on time. Weird. After packing up six boxes of sample sale clothing (something I've been putting off for weeks), I think I deserve food. Today, I brought leftovers from last night's dinner; a friend and I celebrated National Margarita Day with tacos and tequila. (Sadly, no tequila for lunch.) 5 p.m. \u2014 I duck out of work a bit early to make it to my Brazilian wax appointment. I've been pretty consistent with going since I decided this is a beauty/grooming routine worth putting my money into last year, and I love the lady who waxes me.

He comes over and we take an Uber (which he pays for) to the lounge. We each get a beer and a shot and I tell him our plans. He's pumped! I recently made him watch the  2 Dope Queens  HBO special with me (which he loved), and when I saw one of the comedians from the special was performing in Brooklyn, I immediately purchased tickets! He gets us another round of beers and shots and we find our seats. 10:30 p.m. \u2014 The show was hilarious. Our bellies are full of laughter but empty of food, so we're super tipsy.

My boyfriend and I live within six blocks of each other, so I walk home, quickly get dressed, feed my pet, and haul ass to the G train, hoping to make my 1:15 train. 1:11 p.m. \u2014 I make it to Penn Station with time to spare. I buy my ticket and walk down to the train. I'm so eager to see my best friend; we haven't seen each other in a few months and definitely need to catch up! We decide to meet in the middle and see  Black Panther  together.  $28 2:45 p.m. \u2014 Make it to the NJ station, but we miss our movie and my friend is stuck in traffic. I don't wanna wait around in the rain, so I hop in a cab to the theater, where she meets me. We're not interested in seeing the 3-D version (mostly because I can't use my MoviePass for 3D and neither of us wants to pay for the extra cost.) We opt for a later showing and hang out on the couches to talk until then. I've missed this level of black-girl girl talk. She knows my heart.  $10 3:45 p.m. \u2014 We buy movie snacks.

Then I remember he didn't grow up reading the books and doesn't fully get the stories behind each character.

It's sweet and gives me extra time to wake up. 7:30 a.m. \u2014 When I Uber Pool from his place I don't usually end up sharing the ride, but today we make two pickups and there's tons of bus traffic. What's normally a four-minute ride takes 15, so when I get home, I run inside to quickly get ready for work. 9:15 a.m. \u2014 I'm having a bad transportation day! Thank you, MTA for the many delays and crowded cars. I settle into my desk, eat my yogurt and berries from home, and grab an English Breakfast tea from the kitchen stash. I text my roommate to let her know I had no luck with the thermometer search. Turns out my neighborhood pharmacy doesn't rise with the nine-to-fivers. 2 p.m. \u2014 Where did the day go?! I'm starving. I try to bring my lunch at least four days a week, but since I didn't get the chance to grocery shop this weekend, I venture outside for lunch. I settle on a Santa Fe salad from Fresh & Co. and return to the office to eat at my desk. I'm still pretty new at my job and haven't made any friends yet, so I mostly eat at my desk or alone in the kitchen after the lunch rush. I\u2018m working with my therapist on branching out and making friends because it really does bum me out not having someone to confide in at work. The problem is I have a lot of social anxiety and feel weird about inserting myself into conversations with coworkers to make friends.  $9.53 Advertisement 4:45 p.m. \u2014 Feeling peckish, I grab a bag of chips from the vending machine. My roommate says she got a thermometer and that her fever has subsided!  $0.75 5:30 p.m. \u2014 Head out of work to meet up with G. We're going to a screening at Alamo Drafthouse in Brooklyn. We love watching movies together and it's a free date night since he is on a mailing list for movie screenings! When we get inside the theater, I'm immediately consumed by the smell of someone's hot wings and decide I have to get some. I peek at the menu and decide to order from the  Black Panther  specials \u2013 I love that they do a themed menu for the big blockbuster films. I order the Waaddii Berbere spiced wings (roasted chicken wings seasoned with berbere spice and a side of nigella seed-garlic yogurt for dipping). They're very good and I'll have to research this incredible spice. After beers, wings, and soft pretzels, which G. pays for ($34.24), I'm pleasantly full. 9 p.m. \u2014 The movie was good but pretty triggering. It's a Black Lives Matter-esque film in which a police officer kills an unarmed black man. It's set in Bed-Stuy, which I liked because I could recognize the setting and feel connected to the story. G. is significantly moved by the film and kind of questioning his life. After filling out the survey, we decide to peruse Target for a bit but leave empty-handed. We head to Trader Joe's for groceries and pay separately, but G. buys me flowers. He suggests an Uber to my place and I oblige. (He pays.) In the car, we talk about the film as well as work and personal fulfillment goals.  $39.05 Advertisement 10:45 \u2014 G. walks home after our long talk about life. I think the movie affected him more than me. I'm feeling pretty bummed/emotionally drained, but I love that we can talk openly about the things that truly affect us. He's a great guy and the most emotionally available man I've ever dated. I decide to take a long shower to mull over my thoughts.

I had a really unpleasant dentist appointment a few months ago that ended with me leaving the office in tears and still in pain.

I did a lot of research for over a year and when I saw a place I've been to before running a special holiday promotion, I jumped on it. Needless to say, I'm really happy with the way they turned out.

Afterward, we get dinner and drinks at a nearby brewery. I haven't felt very well this week, so I sip on Diet Coke and eat a few snacks from the platters on the table; the company picks up the bill. I head home at about 9 p.m. and prepare my lunch for work tomorrow.

Since I've given up my daily lunch order, I'm letting myself have this vice. While I wait for the barista to make my order, I use the banking app on my phone to pay a friend who has organized an Airbnb for our weekend away next month ($60). I have a few weekends away planned over the next two months and am trying to spread the costs as evenly as possible.  $61.50 2 p.m. \u2014 My colleague treats me to another cappuccino after lunch to celebrate the end of a busy week at work. We work for an acclaimed advertising agency that has a lot of perks, but the industry can be very stressful. There are big budgets and tight deadlines, and our clients have high expectations. Advertisement 7 p.m. \u2014 In my spare time, I volunteer as an emergency responder for a national rescue organization. Our monthly meeting is tonight and I don't have time to go home first. I'm starving but don't want to splurge on fast food, so I pick up a coconut water and a raw cacao muesli snack from a health food store to keep me going for the evening ($6). I also pop into the pharmacy to pick up corn plasters for my feet \u2013 a lesson in wearing ill-fitting shoes ($3.77).

I've woken up with a raging headache, so my friend buys me a cup of coffee ($1.50) to perk me up. 11:30 a.m. \u2014 I leave the beach mid-morning to meet a friend I haven't seen in months. She's invited me to join her at a pottery painting studio, but my head is still pounding and I'm not feeling inspired. I order food and eat a toasted sandwich with fries with a sparkling mineral water while she paints.

I'd totally forgotten about it, and I'm miserable that I have to do it this afternoon when I'm feeling so rough. So, in typical style, I stop at a garage shop on the way home and buy a stupid amount of sweets and chocolate to comfort myself while I work. Screw the diet.  $12 7 p.m. \u2014 Done for the day! I worked all afternoon and I'm still feeling ill, but a good friend of mine is about to fly home to New Zealand and this is my last chance to see her and her kids for at least a year. I pop a few painkillers and drag myself to a local kid-friendly steakhouse. We order sirloins with baked potatoes, crispy onions and Diet Cokes while we chat.

I wake up feeling refreshed and energetic. I go for a long walk along the coast with a friend, followed by breakfast at one of our usual spots. We do this most weekends and it's my favorite way to spend the morning. I order an unsweetened iced latte and a slice of banana bread with honey. We're heading down to the beach, so I order a cold juice to go; it's hot outside!  $9 Advertisement 3 p.m. \u2014 I spend the rest of the morning on the beach, and it's a perfect day. After a few miserable days, I am in my element now, spending hours swimming in the tidal pools. My family is coming over for dinner tonight, so eventually, I drag myself up and go to the grocery store on my way home (parking costs $1). I shop for the week's groceries as well as ingredients I need for the dinner party, so my bill comes in quite a lot higher than normal. Even though I'm saving a lot of money by not ordering lunch during the week, my weekly grocery bill has definitely gone up lately. I buy chicken, lettuce, cucumber, baby tomatoes, sesame seeds, cheese, butter, hummus, Diet Coke, fish cakes, grapes, and plums for the week. For the dinner I'm cooking, I buy meatballs, pasta, fresh basil, my favorite pasta sauce, and zucchini noodles for my mother, who doesn't eat pasta ($70.47).

Even though I pay for private medical aid every month, my plan only covers hospital visits, so I have to pay out of pocket for this. This amount throws my whole budget off, so I decide to pay for it out my savings account. I usually transfer my freelance income straight into this account and keep it for rainy days. This is definitely one of those days.  $18 Advertisement 3:45 p.m. \u2014 My dentist's office is above a grocery shop and I pop in there on the way to my car to buy milk, which I forgot to add to my cart yesterday. It's not my usual grocery store, and when I see that they have five-liter bottles of water in stock, I grab two. Our city is in the midst of a serious drought, and we're faced with the very real threat of our taps being switched off in a few months. People have been panic-buying water, and finding five-liter bottles in stock is akin to winning the lottery. On my way out, I pay $1 for parking.  $6.50 4:30 p.m. \u2014 My mouth is numb on both sides and pretty sore.

I've managed to catch her for a drink and a chat in between her trips, but this is the first time in a while that we've had the time for a proper catch-up.

I booked plane tickets for one trip and an Airbnb stay for another, so I'm a little strapped for cash. Instead, I brew a mug of pour-over coffee and take another cup of cold brew to go for when I get to work. I silently curse myself for forgetting to grab a cheese stick for breakfast (weird, I know). Instead, I eat a spoonful of peanut butter when I get to the office an hour later. 1 p.m. \u2014 Resist joining in on the office lunch order and eat my sad (but free!) PB&J at my desk. I also have Greek yogurt, an apple, and more peanut butter. I keep a variety of snacks at my desk since I like to graze. Chocolate covered almonds are a current favorite. 3 p.m. \u2014 Hit a slump at work and grab a Diet Coke from the office fridge. Then I spend waaaaay too much money on a shirt I see online and feel I MUST own, immediately. I don't feel too guilty since it was just my birthday and I returned a $400 pair of shoes yesterday. I also just sent a client an invoice for freelance work I did last month, so I'll get a check for $600 in three weeks or so.  $292 5:30 p.m. \u2014 Leave work and head to the supermarket. I live with my parents, so grocery shopping is kind of a gray area. I always pay for items if I'm the only person eating them, but there are always basics that my parents buy like OJ, eggs, milk, dry goods in our kitchen that I use, too. I'm planning to make Buddha bowls for lunch for the rest of the week, so I buy sweet potatoes, kale, chickpeas, tahini, onions, avocado, and cucumber, as well as ingredients for chia pudding \u2013 a breakfast meal prep first for me. I'm planning to make it with almond milk, almond butter, and fresh berries on top. I have everything at home already except the chia seeds, so I buy those and bananas to share with the fam. I also pick up buffalo sauce, rosemary, and Italian sausage per my mom's request, and a bag of pretzels because I think I'm out.  $46.77 Advertisement 9 p.m. \u2014 Finish meal prepping somewhat successfully, and then go for a quick bike ride. It's been unusually warm for the past week, but it's still a little frigid riding around! I haven't joined a gym since moving back home about six months ago, so I try to go for jogs or bike rides when the temperature allows. I think I'll research yoga and spin studios that I can start going to on my way home from work. Daily Total: $338.77", "day_two": "Day Two: 7:15 a.m. \u2014 I snooze my alarm three too many times and eventually get up. I started using a silk pillowcase recently, which seems to have eliminated my frizzy hair. (I usually shower at night so I can straighten my air-dried hair in the morning.) This is great because I'm running late today. Instead of turning the flat iron on, I run a brush through my hair, do half my skincare routine (currently loving Sunday Riley Good Genes and StriVectin neck cream), and get dressed. There's leftover coffee in the pot that my mom made earlier this morning. I take a mugful to reheat at work. 8:15 a.m. \u2014 I can't wait until I get to work to start caffeinating, so I go to Dunkin' to get a medium iced coffee. I recently learned that both of my parents are pre-diabetic and have been hyper-vigilant about added sugar lately. Instead of my preferred caramel swirl flavor, I order a French vanilla iced coffee (which is sugar-free!) with almond milk.  $2.73 Advertisement 12 p.m. \u2014 I eat my Buddha bowl but am still hungry, probably because I forgot to bring the chia pudding. I tack on a small order to a coworker's lunch run: three Thai pork and veggie dumplings. I give him $5 in cash and enjoy my second course.  $5 5:15 p.m. \u2014 This is a really bad day, money-wise. I have a hair appointment right after work, and since I know it's going to last at least two hours, I need a snack so I don't get hangry. I go to Wendy's for my favorite fast food snack from my vegetarian years: a sour cream and chive baked potato and a Diet Coke.  $3.21 8 p.m. \u2014 Hair is done and it looks pretty good! I've been searching for a new stylist and colorist and found this salon on Groupon. I got a cut, partial foil, and blow dry for $60! I bought it a few weeks ago, so I just tip $25 ... and then I'm talked into buying a pre-blow dry hair product. With my first-time customer 15% discount, it comes to around $14. I book an appointment for 10 weeks from now. Being blonde is expensive!  $39 8:30 p.m. \u2014 My gas tank is just under half full, so I stop and fill up before I go home. My dad schooled me on the importance of keeping a full tank whenever it's below freezing. Plus, it hurts my credit card a little less to buy half a tank at a time.

I try to bring my lunch every day because I want to save as much money as possible while I'm living at home. 1 p.m. \u2014 Add my order to a coworker's coffee run. It's been a stressful morning, and since I already have money in my Venmo balance, it doesn't feel like I'm spending anything. Now that's a dangerous game.  $2.75 6 p.m. \u2014 I have a dinner date with a guy I recently started dating. The restaurant has a weeknight special, so our meals come with a bottle of wine. We get a lamb appetizer and order different steaks for our entr\u00e9es. It's super delicious and I let my date pay. He makes about three times as much money as I do, so I usually pay for our outings one-third of the time. 8 p.m. \u2014 I'm not one for weeknight drinking, but we wander to a bar across the street and get a round of beers. It's $12 and I leave a $3 tip. I have to drive home, so I take a few sips of mine, make a mental note to order it again next time since it's delicious, and slide it over to my date.

I grab my food for the day and a canned La Colombe latte I find in the back of the fridge. 2 p.m. \u2014 Ah, the daily afternoon slump. I take a mental break from work and scroll through Pinterest and Zara's website. I start to panic because I can't find the jeans I love (mine are starting to look worn out), so I order three pairs that look similar. I hope I can find a substitute.  $119.97 6 p.m. \u2014 Get home from work and go for a bike ride before dinner. (Is it just me, or does anyone else have to immediately change into athleisure clothing the second they walk in the door at the end of the day?) My mom makes soup with chicken, lentils, and vegetables, so I eat a big bowl with a piece of pita bread. She's the best. 8 p.m. \u2014 Set up in front of the TV and crank out some freelance work. I owe an editor a handful of articles and can't send an invoice until I turn them in. Luckily, they're pretty fun to write, and I can't complain about getting work done while watching  Seinfeld  reruns. I originally started freelancing when I was in between full-time jobs two years ago, and love that it still gives me a creative outlet. In between sentences, I browse Amazon and restock on vitamins. I'm all about prevention, so I take fish oil, collagen, vitamin D, lutein, carotenoid antioxidants, and a multivitamin every day.

Unfortunately, the day isn't off to a great start \u2013 I can't get my laptop to turn on. I've had this MacBook for over six years and I do all my freelance work on it. It also holds thousands and thousands of photos, so I start to panic. My dad (who is retired) offers to take it to a local tech guy to get a diagnosis. It's always something: Last time this happened, it cost me $300 and a promise to regularly back up my hard drive. Luckily, I can deduct these kinds of expenses when I do my taxes in a few months. 9:15 a.m. \u2014 I was too distracted making phone calls on the drive to work this morning (yay, doctor's appointments!) to eat my breakfast in the car, so I eat my chia pudding at my desk with extra peanut butter on top. While I'm eating, I distract myself from my laptop situation by shopping online for a birthday gift for one of my best friends. I pick out a pair of earrings from Nordstrom, add gift wrap, and have them sent directly to her. I'll mail her a birthday card closer to the actual day since Nordstrom shipping is so unpredictable.  $29.54 1 p.m. \u2014 I cast my last Buddha bowl aside and join the office sushi order.

I think he's just being a good sport. We go to a fast-casual burger place, where I get a black-bean veggie burger and we get truffle fries to share, plus two beers. (My date pays.)

At the theater, he buys popcorn for us to share.  $29.50 Advertisement 10 p.m. \u2014 I have a ridiculous sweet tooth, plus I want to stay out late so I don't feel like a grandma (like I do every weekend).

One of the best parts of living in my hometown again is getting to spend time with old friends. 11 a.m. \u2014 We go to a vegan caf\u00e9 for brunch, where I get a delicious a\u00e7a\u00ed bowl and a turmeric latte. Yum! The total is around $16, and I tip 15%.  $19.88 2 p.m. \u2014 After I drop off my friend, I pop over to T.J. Maxx. There is absolutely nothing I need here, but I love browsing the home stuff and clearance clothing racks. T.J. Maxx and Marshalls also have weirdly good beauty and skincare products. I buy charcoal toothpaste, two brightening face masks, and a bottle of nail polish. The total comes to $13.96, but I have $8 in store credit and pay the rest in cash.  $5.96 3 p.m. \u2014 A friend who lives nearby has a birthday coming up, so I pop into a nearby liquor store to see if anything catches my eye. I buy a bottle of sparkling wine that I've heard good things about and is on sale. While I'm driving home, my dad calls me to say that the tech guy thinks he'll be able to recover everything on my hard drive and can double the memory space for less than $200.

I'll broil the steak and stretch it across five salads for lunch this week. I also buy a pint of Ben & Jerry's frozen yogurt, a bag of granola, Greek yogurt, pears, an avocado, hummus, and pita bread. I pay with my Amex so that I can get 2% cash back.

I'll probably still try to submit the receipt and get it reimbursed later. I check the FSA website, which says medical consultations are eligible, so I have hope.  $100 12 p.m. \u2014 I have a team meeting to talk about new stories we're working on. I text one of my more prominent clients to get the scoop on a fake Facebook account made under his name. Never a dull day at this job, I swear. 12:30 p.m. \u2014 Back at my desk eating lunch. I've been eating the same exact one nearly every weekday for the past two years and I'm not ashamed. I've gotten it down to an art and know exactly how much is necessary for each ingredient for a week's worth of sandwiches for me and J. Advertisement 1:30 p.m. \u2014 J. Venmos me for half of the Paint Nite, even though I wanted to pay for it as a date! He also sends $750 to reimburse me for covering his share of rent this month. He owns a condo in our old state and he's remodeling the bathroom before getting a new tenant. I paid all of our rent this month so he could pay the remodeling deposit first. I put the money back into my emergency fund. 3 p.m. \u2014 After spending some time preparing press releases for distribution and coaching a coworker on how to respond to an email, I remember that there are Groupons available for a great lunch place (normally $10 for a combo meal) and a smoothie place (usually $5 for a small) by my office. Use the 25% off coupon again!  $6.94 5:30 p.m. \u2014 We have dinner plans but I'm super hungry, so I cut off the end of a bread loaf and eat it with a slice of cheddar. I also eat a few organic gummies I got in a gift box for Christmas. 7 p.m. \u2014 Finally at the restaurant, Stang of Siam, and I'm already in a great mood because we got a prime parking spot right across the street. This West Coast-transplant still doesn't understand the fiasco that is East Coast street parking. Why aren't cities built around cars? The Groupon is good for two glasses of wine, an appetizer, and two entrees. We get two glasses of Malbec (and the pours are GENEROUS), pumpkin curry puffs, pineapple fried rice served in half a pineapple (super 'grammable), and roast duck red curry. The food is delicious and James is pleased because his food is actually spicy. (I did ask the waiter, in Thai, to please make it \"spicy enough for Thai people, not for white people.\") I leave the $10 from the bar guy last night as a tip and James throws in $6.  $10 Advertisement 9:15 p.m. \u2014 We get cozy and settle in to watch the most recent episode of  The Resident . 11 p.m. \u2014 PTFO. Daily Total: $146.94", "day_three": "Day Three: 8 a.m. \u2014 Wake up feeling incredibly well-rested. Lay in bed with J., scrolling through social media and chatting for an hour. We're driving out to Philly later today to visit a friend who lives there and watch the Super Bowl. We debate whether we should use our gym memberships for the first time this morning before heading out. Ew. 9:30 a.m. \u2014 I notice my federal tax refund was deposited into my checking account! I put $500 towards credit card debt and spread the remaining $700 across my various savings accounts. I've already allocated the $111 from my state return to go towards my March \"cash\" budget. (I don't actually pay for anything in cash but I call it that because it's the amount I allocate towards paying my estimated next month's expenses.) 11:45 a.m. \u2014 Somehow spend an hour and 45 minutes at the gym, which is truly wild considering this was about the tenth time I've ever stepped foot in a gym IN MY LIFE. Working out isn't actually that bad \u2013 it's the thought of working out and leaving the couch that's the most difficult. But who knows \u2014 I don't really know what I'm doing so maybe if I were doing it right, the gym part would be difficult, too? We head home to shower and pack for the weekend. Advertisement 2:30 p.m. \u2014 Stop by Wawa to fill the gas tank and grab food on the way to Philly. I'm not super hungry because I ate the leftover pineapple fried rice, but I get a turkey, bacon, and avocado junior hoagie and a small mocha. One does not simply walk into Wawa without getting something. James gets a regular-sized turkey hoagie with approximately 20 toppings on it and a small decaf coffee. I pay for the food and he pays for the gas. This and the rest of what I spend this weekend will come out of my travel budget, which I use for basically any out-of-state trip.  $14.81 5 p.m. \u2014 Make it to Philly a bit late because James spent literally 30 minutes in the Wawa bathroom and we got stuck in traffic. Our friend is out, so his roommate lets us in. J. takes a nap while I browse the Internet. 7:30 p.m. \u2014 After our friend gets back, we decide to walk to Chinatown to try Nan Zhou's Hand Drawn Noodle House. The wait is insane, so we walk down the street until something catches our attention. We walk into a food court of sorts, and while it doesn't have any authentic options, the kitschy fusion food intrigues us. We pick Coreanos, a Mexican-Korean fusion place, where I get double-fried Korean chicken tacos and a can of Coke. Eh, it's okay.  $12.97 8:15 p.m. \u2014 On the way out, we stop at a rolled ice cream place, where I get the Cookie Spree \u2013 cookies-and-cream ice cream, brownies, an Oreo, cream Pocky sticks, and chocolate syrup.  $t Advertisement 9:30 p.m. \u2014 We're back at the apartment and decide to get drunk in our pajamas. We convince our friend to start  Westworld , and he gets totally hooked. I make myself a vodka Sprite and drink it while we watch. Our friend asks us if there will be zombies later in the show, and I do my best not to give any spoilers. 11 p.m. \u2014 Slightly drunk but weirdly very motivated to do some adulting, so I research refinancing my student loan. Get a quote from SoFi and figure out I can reduce my interest rate by about a half percent, which will allow me to up my monthly payments by just $50 but pay it all off in five years. I'm making the last payment on my car this month and have been wondering how hard I should go on my student loan versus investing the money. If I stayed with my current loan holder, I'd have to pay $470/month to pay it off in five years, so refinancing will allow me to put just a bit more towards the loan, still save a bulk of my old car payment, and meet my goal of paying it off by the time I'm 30. I'll check other rates when I get home. Daily Total: $34.78", "day_four": "Day Four: 9:30 a.m. \u2014 Sleep in a bit. Shower and help clean the apartment because it's game day! Fly, Eagles, fly! 10:30 a.m. \u2014 We all walk over to Reading Terminal Market and I debate whether to get a roast pork sandwich from DiNic's or crepes from Profi's Creperie. I got John's Roast Pork when we visited last month (and it was DIVINE \u2014 10/10 would recommend) and want to try the famous DiNic's, but I behave because we're going to pig out later tonight. I get a Nutella-banana crepe and James pays for us and our friend. I grab two coffees for the guys and a mocha for me from Old City Coffee.  $9.10 Advertisement 11:15 a.m. \u2014 Still kinda hungry, so we each get a bagel from Market Bakery. I get an onion bagel with chive cream cheese. J. pays for all of us because of the $5 card minimum. I Venmo him for mine.  $3 12 p.m. \u2014 We still have six hours to kill before the game, and our friend heads upstairs to play basketball. James has never seen the Rocky Steps, so we walk the mile there in the drizzling rain. We walk up the steps and enjoy the view for a bit. I hold J. and reminisce about the last time I came to this museum nearly a decade ago. I was dating a guy who eventually dumped me for not going to his church and got married less than a year later. Life is wild, y'all. 1:30 p.m. \u2014 Back at the apartment. I help clean more and get another rate quote on refinancing my student loan. This place gives me nearly the exact same interest rate, but I would also get $250 to pay off my principal since there's a promotion for AAA members. I make an account and plan to officially apply in a few days. 6:30 p.m. \u2014 The game starts and we have an array of apps, alcohol, and pizzas. I eat two pieces of pizza and what feels like a bucket of guac, plus a few Coke and Fireball drinks. James paid for the pizza so we all Venmo him our shares.  $5.50 10:30 p.m. \u2014 HOLY SHIT the Eagles won! I take a shot and go down into the streets and riot with everyone else. It feels like the entire city's out here. I'm not even a huge football fan, but it's an incredible, once-in-a-lifetime experience to be out here with hardcore Eagles fans. I'll never forget this insanity. James and I bounce when people start smashing the stoplights and throwing glass into the streets. There are people throwing fireworks into the crowd from the skyscrapers and a group marches by with a full stoplight they somehow dismantled. The celebration is now in dangerous territory and we don't want to get hurt. Advertisement 1 a.m. \u2014 Realize we're not going to make it out of the city tonight, so we crash at our friend's place and plan on driving to Baltimore in a few hours once the streets are cleared. Daily Total: $17.60", "day_five": "Day Five: 4:45 a.m. \u2014 Wake up to make the two-hour-plus trip back to Baltimore. I feel like shit, and five hours ago somehow feels like a decade ago. I pay for parking since James paid last time we were here. Also, the poor guy is driving.  $14 7:15 a.m. \u2014 Back at home and take a short nap before heading to work. I feel really bad for our cat, who is exceptionally needy and is yowling nonstop because he missed us. My first meeting isn't until 10, so I plan to make it to the office then. 8:50 a.m. \u2014 Wake up, shower, use the Starbucks app to order a mocha, and head to work. I somehow don't feel as awful as I expected to. Just a little cloudy-headed, but not terribly tired. Maybe I'm not as old as I think. 10:30 a.m. \u2014 Ask my boss for advice on how to delicately push back on a client who made an outsized promise to a reporter. It takes a lot of coordination to get film crews around campus (we have to alert security, get them parking, and make sure patients aren't around the area we're filming), so the access they want isn't feasible. 12 p.m. \u2014 Get a free lunch (turkey bacon sandwich on ciabatta and a Diet Coke) from a conference that I'm presenting at today. My presentation goes off without a hitch, much to my surprise. I thought I'd be useless after last night. The doctor that invited me to present actually yelled at me and made me cry last year (for something that wasn't my fault), so I was a bit nervous to finally meet him in person, but he was incredibly pleasant. Advertisement 4 p.m. \u2014 I think about what life would be like if I started going to the gym regularly and remember that I need sports bras. I buy a three-pack of cheap Fruit of the Loom ones on Amazon Prime. Maybe someday (like when I get abs) I'll be at the level of wearing ONLY a sports bra as a top and can get cuter, more expensive ones. For now, I just need the basics to wear under my raggedy t-shirts.  $13.25 5:30 p.m. \u2014 Home. Give extra attention to the cat, remove chicken from the freezer to thaw, finish my application for the student loan refinancing and watch a video about contributor applications for a position I'm interested in. I applied last week and am anxious to hear back! I write for a living, but there's only so much room for creativity when you're writing about medical research. In my personal time, I love to write about culture, so this opportunity sounds incredible to me. There's a ton of interest though, so I probably won't hear back for at least a month. I also answer a media request that rolled in from a major outlet. 7:30 p.m. \u2014 James is finally home and we sit down to eat crispy parmesan chicken breasts with saut\u00e9ed garlic zucchini and leftover sweet potatoes together. I'm the primary cook in our house because cooking is relaxing for me and I show my love through cooking (a very Thai value that my mom instilled in me). J. says he'll probably go the gym tonight and I spend the next hour thinking about whether I want to join him. Advertisement 10 p.m. \u2014 I decide to go to the gym after all, and spend an hour on the rowing machine, working out my arms and learning to use that crazy machine that you can move into different positions for different workouts. I still don't know what I'm doing, but I'm proud of myself for at least going and trying new things. I message our old roommate/my BFF, who works as a personal trainer on the side, and he confirms: \"Action over everything.\" He says overthinking exercise leads to analysis paralysis. So motivational. 11 p.m. \u2014 I spend time organizing my planner for tomorrow (any Plum Paper ladies out there?), and hit the sack. Daily Total: $27.25", "day_six": "Day Six: 7:45 a.m. \u2014 Wake up and groan. I was in the middle of a good dream before my stupid alarm clock went off. Lay in bed for a few extra minutes before getting up to get ready. James is halfway through his daily 30-minute shower. 11 a.m. \u2014 I was supposed to get lunch with coworkers today, but one of them had a conflict so we had to reschedule. I'm slightly annoyed because I could've packed lunch today and now I have to buy lunch twice this week. I grew up in a low-income immigrant household where my mom often told me how short we were on rent and other bills, so now as an adult, I often feel overly guilty or frivolous for spending money. I'm trying to work on it, though, because I know I'm not in the same situation as my parents were and life is meant to be enjoyed. Advertisement 11:30 a.m. \u2014 Trying to complete a media request from a few hours ago and am annoyed because a reporter is trying to get our doctor to comment on a specific real case, which we don't allow. 12 p.m. \u2014 Pick up lunch with a coworker; I get a curry chicken wrap and a can of Coke. Back at my desk, I coach the doctor about not commenting on the case and eat the wrap, which is incredible. Now I remember why people buy food all the time. The wrap is too big for one meal, but kind of too small to split into two meals. I reach the halfway point and have to make a decision. I save half for tomorrow.  $10 12:30 p.m. \u2014 Start downloading a Spotify playlist on my phone so I can listen offline. I've been on the free trial period of Spotify Premium and will have to start paying the fee at the end of the month, but it'll be worth it if I go to the gym regularly and listen to my music. I need music in the background to help me concentrate. This reminds me to browse Amazon for an armband and new headphones for my phone. You can tell I'm really getting into this gym thing. Hopefully, it'll become a lifelong habit instead of a fleeting high for only a few weeks. I'm really going to hold myself accountable, especially now that I've invested money into it.  $15.46 2:45 p.m. \u2014 Trying to finish up a press release but keep getting distracted by incoming emails from doctors wanting me to look at their research papers and promote their community events. My coworker Skypes me about going across the street for shots. I invite her over to share the bottle of Fireball I keep in my drawer instead. We each take a shot and complain about work \u2013 two people quit at the end of last year, and we're starting to feel the pain. Advertisement 4:30 p.m. \u2014 I send an aggressive response to a colleague who always tries to drag me into things via email. (This time, she attached previous emails and added a \"please advise.\" Ugh.) I'm unreasonably angry because I always have trouble with this person and spend the next 10 minutes trying to calm down. The email she sent wasn't even that annoying or uncalled for, but my patience is wearing thin from being overworked. 6:15 p.m. \u2014 Home and feeling much more zen after calling my mom and grocery shopping. My dad's birthday is coming up and I tell her that I'm going to send $100 on Friday so she and my dad can go out. I have a chronic illness and my parents sacrificed everything for me. I feel like I owe them something. At the store, I got a five-pound bag of apples, lettuce, salad mix, six wheat rolls, two packs of chicken sausages (BOGO!), half a pound of turkey for sandwiches, feta cheese, yogurt, half a gallon of chocolate milk, kielbasa (something I like to keep in the freezer to cook and eat with rice on lazy days), and a new sink strainer. This should last us for lunch and dinners until the end of the week. I request half from James on Venmo.  $22.90 7:30 p.m. \u2014 J.'s finally home and we eat leftover chicken from last night with wheat rotini and roasted garlic-and-herb Prego sauce. I eat more pasta because I'm extra hungry after my small lunch. Advertisement 8:30 p.m. \u2014 After showering, I spend the next few hours catching up on  How to Get Away with Murder , organizing my savings and debt repayment spreadsheet, and snuggling with the cat while James reads news articles and creates a Zillow ad for his condo. 10 p.m. \u2014 Still kind of hungry, I eat a granola bar from the pantry.

UGH. 9:30 a.m. \u2014 Answer emails, organize my weekly work-in-progress document, and make myself a mocha in the office kitchen. Roll my eyes after I pick up a spam call from a guy who wants to give me a \"free\" cruise to the Bahamas in exchange for me telling my family and friends. 10:30 a.m. \u2014 Spent half an hour hiding in a coworker's office to avoid getting dragged into vetting a potential patient story. Other teams always send highly specific stuff to check. My boss told me that it's not my job to assess these while we search for new team members, but no one else on my team is available, and my boss isn't around to back me up if I decline. 11 a.m. \u2014 Speak to one of the student loan refinancing companies. They have to verify that I really submitted an application since there's a credit report alert activated right now. I turned it on after I realized someone was fraudulently using my checking card. Advertisement 12 p.m. \u2014 Heat up the leftover wrap and eat it before a BYO lunch meet-and-greet with the presenter for one of our events tonight. The wrap is messy and a bit smelly so I want to enjoy it in its full glory alone in my office. 2:45 p.m. \u2014 Drive up to campus to connect one of our doctors with the presenter, who's looking to meet engaging doctors for opportunities to work as consultants with Hollywood producers. 4 p.m. \u2014 The meeting goes really well! I knew he'd be a great fit. 5 p.m. \u2014 The event ends and I sneak two slices of pizza while chatting with my teammates. I get a slice of pepperoni and a slice of cheese and they're mediocre, but hey, free food! 6 p.m. \u2014 Home after the event and upload my latest student loan billing document to the refinancing company for review. I also work on submitting my writing for an award. Applications just opened today! I select my best pieces from 2017, create cover sheets for all of them, and merge them all into one PDF before submitting. 7:45 p.m. \u2014 James is finally home and he seems super stressed. He's been working late the past few days and is trying to oversee the remodeling from 3,000 miles away, find new tenants, and prepare his taxes all at once. I don't envy him. He pours himself a bowl of cereal (this is why I'm the primary cook; we'd be eating cereal every night otherwise) and calls the contractor to talk about the remodeling while I chat with Amazon Prime about why my sports bras weren't delivered today. 9:30 p.m. \u2014 Our plan was to go to the gym but J. takes a ton of time to use the bathroom. By the time he gets out, I'm already in bed wrapped up in a Sherpa blanket. He joins and so does our cat. We're definitely not going to the gym now.

I wake up, heat up a cup of cold brew that my husband dripped the night before, add about half a cup of organic grass-fed whole milk, and then do a three-minute meditation on Headspace and a five-minute yoga flow on YouTube. Afterwards, I put my husband's lunch on the counter so he doesn't forget to take it, make myself a second coffee (this time with coconut/almond milk) in my favorite Hydro Flask thermos, and throw my own in my lunch box. I take a quick shower and drive to work. 11 a.m. \u2014 I work with my direct report to get a bunch of deliverables out this morning, and then take a quick break for breakfast. It takes me a while to get hungry in the morning, probably because of the quantity of milk that I drink with my coffee (literally half coffee, half milk). I eat a sliced apple with a bunch of peanut butter, which I manage to get all over my pants. I run to the bathroom and use a wet paper towel to wash it off. 2 p.m. \u2014 I heat up a little container of roasted veggies and chicken breast and read  The New York Times  while I eat. There's no place to buy food within walking distance of my office, but I save a lot of money and eat a lot healthier because I always bring my food, so I don't care much. 5 p.m. \u2014 I get home, change quickly into running clothes, and walk to my community's gym, which is free and really nice. I sprint on the treadmill as fast as I can for a mile and then walk back to my apartment. I recently got to the point where I can run a mile in under eight minutes, which means my workouts are really short. Occasionally I run a mile and a half or even two, but I get so bored running that if I'm not feeling tired by the home stretch, I just crank up the speed so that I work up enough of a sweat to justify jumping off after a mile. Head back to my apartment and do another quick yoga flow to stretch. Advertisement 8:30 p.m. \u2014 Dinnertime. I meal plan each week and buy groceries ahead of time. Tonight I poach fresh wild cod I bought at Whole Foods on Sunday with white wine, chicken broth, a bay leaf, and squeeze of lemon. I also saut\u00e9 wild mushrooms and broccolini and cook farro in chicken broth. My husband gets home at 8:30 and we eat right away because I'm starving. Then I defrost soup for our lunches tomorrow and slice apples so we have snacks. 9:30 p.m. \u2014 My husband and I currently sleep on a mattress on the floor \u2013 mostly because we don't want to waste money on cheap furniture and aren't ready to buy anything as expensive as what we ultimately want. We're hoping to start a family at some point next year and will need to move to a bigger apartment, so I figure that might be a good time to buy furniture. A quick look at the website of our favorite furniture store, Room & Board, shows me that this is likely to be a significant financial investment on our part. My husband is a minimalist and would happily live in an empty apartment, so I like to give him plenty of notice when I start thinking about these expensive purchases. I fire the opening salvo by telling him it will probably be hard to get off a mattress on the floor when I'm eight months pregnant, so if he wants a baby we'll have to buy a bed. He smiles and tells me that's why I do yoga. I laugh, and we head off to our sad mattress on the floor.

I'm not sure if I'll do it again next year because I got this one for 40% off, but so far it's the only thing that has been able to help me meditate on a regular basis (even if it's only three to five minutes a day). We have a small one-bedroom apartment, but because my husband doesn't get up until 8:30 most days, I have the living room and kitchen to myself almost every morning. I take my coffee and lunch to go. Before I leave, I grab a cookie I made a few weeks ago out of the freezer and slip it into my husband's lunch with a little love note. 1 p.m. \u2014 I was in back-to-back meetings all morning and I'm starving. My director swings by my cube while I'm shoveling an extra large slice of Honeycrisp apple in my mouth, takes one look at me, and says he'll come back later. He knows I can be difficult when I'm hungry, and he knows I didn't get to eat breakfast this morning. I promise him I'll come find him as soon as I've eaten. When I walk into his office a few minutes later, he hands me a cookie just in case I'm still hungry. Since I try not to eat refined sugar (with the exception of really good desserts) or preservatives, I don't accept, but thank him for thinking of me. We quickly review a contract I wrote up for a program I'm expanding out; he recommends a few changes but is happy with the document overall. Advertisement 4:30 p.m. \u2014 I didn't get to eat my lunch today since I was running around to offsite meetings all afternoon, so when I get home I'm too tired to exercise. I eat two slices of fresh bread (from a Bay Area bakery called Acme) slathered with butter while I read Money Diaries. Delicious. Afterward, I'm still hungry, so I have a  cara cara orange  and a bunch of brie and crackers, and then do laundry and make dinner while I watch a dinosaur documentary on CuriosityStream. 8 p.m. \u2014 My husband comes home from work and we eat dinner. I made a salad with lettuce, radicchio, endive, fennel, radish, scallions, tomato, avocado, black beans, frozen corn, shredded cheddar cheese, and chicken breast, slathered in Cindy's ranch. Ranch is my weakness. We watch  Peaky Blinders  (I just discovered this show and am OBSESSED) while eating a few squares of Trader Joe's 72% cacao dark chocolate. I honestly hate it, but it mutes my chocolate and sugar cravings effectively. We buy big packages of it because my husband insists on buying everything in its most cost-effective quantity, but I think the big bars oxidize by the end and the last part tastes far worse than the first. 10 p.m. \u2014 I'm out of deodorant and couldn't find a non-antiperspirant at Target last week. I decide to try a new natural brand from Amazon, Primal Pit Paste. It's a little bit expensive, but I order it anyway. Since it's Prime, it will come in two days.

I use another thermos we have in the cabinet but I don't like it. 11 a.m. \u2014 Thermos is nowhere to be found. It might turn up somewhere, but I'm not taking any chances, so I hop on Amazon and order a new one in the same color ($21.45). I see that the green is only $16.50, so I add that to the cart as well and buy both. I've been meaning to buy a backup, and this seems like a good opportunity. Both ship via Prime, and will arrive by tomorrow!  $41.12 2 p.m. \u2014 I'm absolutely starving, but my day has been a blur of meetings, and the next is offsite. I eat a half a baked sweet potato in my car with hands at a red light. It's not ideal, but better than being hungry. 5 p.m. \u2014 I get home and race to the gym for my one-mile sprint. I buy a new song on iTunes on my way to the gym. I buy four to six songs a month on iTunes because I can't run without new music and a good running beat. I have extra energy and the new song is good, so I make it a mile and a half. Later, I take a long shower, wash my hair, and do a face mask while I make dinner. One of my best friends calls, so we chat on the phone while I cook. As always, I also lay out my outfit for the following morning. I don't like to wake up my husband, so I leave my clothes in the living room the night before so all I need to do in the morning is slip out of the bedroom and shut the door behind me.  $1.29 Advertisement 8:30 p.m. \u2014 Tonight we have lentils that I cooked with onions and a chopped potato on top of wilted fresh spinach. I also slice half an avocado into each bowl and put soft-boiled eggs on top. I grate copious amounts of parmesan over the whole thing. As usual, I package some up for our lunches tomorrow simultaneously. As soon as my husband walks in, we eat. I'm starving. After dinner, we split a grapefruit for \"dessert.\" It doesn't really count as dessert as far as I'm concerned, but it is delicious. 10 p.m. \u2014 My husband watches a car show called  The Grand Tour  while I obsessively plan our next Europe trip. We're headed to the UK, and I've already booked our hotel. We'll be staying at The Waldorf Astoria, and although I have mixed feelings about not staying in a cute boutique hotel, I'm hoping we'll have enough Hilton points to stay in Hawaii for free next year because of it. I've created a list of the museums and landmarks we want to see in London, and I Google Map all of the locations so I can plan the best itinerary. We'll have to walk about five miles a day for the first two days and nine on the third day. I make a note that we should Uber between a few of the legs so we don't tire ourselves out. (We did a 10-mile walk one day in Paris when we were there recently and got way too exhausted.) We head to bed around 11:30.

I have a call with our East Coast design team to go over deliverables they've been working on and decide to do it from home. I text my direct report to let her know that I'll be in late this morning and give her a few tasks. 11 a.m. \u2014 I have my usual apple/peanut butter snack, and then run by my director's office. I requested a pretty substantial raise a few months ago, and my director agreed but needed to get approval from our executive director first. I used to intensely dislike negotiating, but I've worked hard to get better at it and now I don't find it quite so distasteful. I ask my director whether or not our ED will approve the raise, and he tells me it's looking good but that he's waiting for final confirmation. 2 p.m. \u2014 I drive to an offsite meeting a little early and eat my leftovers in the car. I browse the Nordstrom website while I'm in the car and find some things I want, but think about our upcoming trip and decide I need to save the money more than I need the clothes. Because we want to start a family next year, my goal is to have $25,000 in my slush savings account by the time a baby is born. Between traveling and bedroom furniture, I'm going to need to save very effectively between now and then if I want to accomplish this. My husband and I never worked out a formal financial agreement, but our spending habits are fairly similar, so we haven't argued over finances yet. This is, in part, because we save separately, so if we disagree over something the other wants to buy, we use our personal slush savings to buy the item. So I want to make sure I always have enough money to buy myself anything I want, even if we disagree. Advertisement 4 p.m. \u2014 I stop by my salon to get my monthly lash fill ($75). It takes about 90 minutes to glue all the individual lashes on, and I find lying there impossibly boring. But my eyes look so fabulous that I literally only have to wear a little bronzer and blush for the rest of the month, so it's worth every cent. My other regular health and beauty expenses include a one-hour massage per month, and I'm finishing up my last round of laser hair removal (which has cost me about $2,000 for bikini and underarms in total). The lashes and massage I put on our joint card, but the laser hair removal I pay for out of my slush savings. 5:30 p.m. \u2014 I can't get my lashes wet for four hours, so I do a quick yoga flow at home instead of a run so I don't get too sweaty. I rinse the day off in the shower after my mini workout and start on dinner. Tonight we're having roasted cauliflower tossed in olive oil, garlic, lemon, and parsley, roasted red potatoes with garlic and olive oil, grilled asparagus, and grilled flatiron steak. I put the steak on the counter and drizzle it with olive oil, garlic, and salt, and then my husband and I head down to the communal courtyard to grill the steak and asparagus when he gets home. We'll take the leftovers for lunch tomorrow. We also make bubble water with our Soda Stream and squeeze a lime in it. Our local water tastes so mineral-y that I can't drink it plain, so we bought a Soda Stream and go through at least 14 limes a week between the two of us. I'm not sure if that much carbonated water is good for me, but at least I won't be getting scurvy anytime soon. Advertisement 9 p.m. \u2014 We watch Netflix on the sofa and I meal plan for next week while eating a cara cara orange. I follow NYT Cooking on Instagram and usually save at least one featured recipe to try. We head to bed around 11.

I do my usual morning routine and race out the door. When I get to work, I see that my project manager has set everything up perfectly. I'm lucky to have her on my team. 11 a.m. \u2014 I give my project manager my credit card number to order pizza for the program launch, but the bank flags the purchase and blocks the card. I call in to straighten everything out, and eventually, the pizza arrives. I'm starving, so I scarf down a piece and toss the crust. (I don't like crust enough to justify eating the extra white carbs. I try to save sugars and non-whole grain carbs for things that I really, really like, and pizza crust doesn't make the cut.) I'll submit this purchase to my monthly expense report. I had to travel two weeks for work this month, so my expense report will be really high. My husband and I have a travel card that gives us extra points for travel-related expenses, so I'm always happy to use my own card instead of a corporate card. ($175.74 expensed) Advertisement 1:30 p.m. \u2014 Program launch goes off without a hitch, although my presentation could have been better (I'm still working on my public speaking skills). Regardless, I sign up an additional group for the program, meaning this year I've brought in enough business to cover myself and my direct report at our fully burdened rate to the organization we work for. 3 p.m. \u2014 I head to the grocery store and buy food for next week: one gallon of organic grass-fed whole milk from a local creamery, one bottle of toasted coconut almond milk, organic butter, olive oil, cheddar cheese, goat cheese, free-range eggs, whole milk Greek yogurt, steel cut oats, and bulk whole wheat flour.  $61.96 3:30 p.m. \u2014 I head to a farm stand with really cheap local produce. I buy lettuce, endive, radicchio, fennel, spinach, zucchini, beets, tomato, cucumber, peppers, cara cara oranges, avocados, limes, lemons, and grapefruit.  $31.25 6:30 p.m. \u2014 Tonight I defrost a ball of pizza dough from Whole Foods and let it rise while I work out. When I get back I stretch it out, sprinkle cornmeal on a cookie sheet (someday I'd like a real pizza stone, but for now a cookie sheet works just fine), and add plain tomato sauce I warmed with olive oil and garlic. I top it with shredded whole milk mozzarella, thinly sliced mushrooms, peppers, onions, and black olives. I also make a salad with lettuce, endive, radicchio, shredded carrot, tomato, cucumber, avocado, scallion, tomato, and balsamic dressing. When my husband gets home, we bake the pizza and eat while watching a movie. Then it's a grapefruit for dessert again. Advertisement 9 p.m. \u2014 I have a coupon for a box of pears, so I send them to a friend who has been going through a tough time.

We buy four full chicken breasts (we eat one or two a week), a pound of chicken thighs, a flatiron steak, a pound of ground turkey, a half pound of bacon, sliced turkey, and smoked gouda. The meat isn't very cheap here, but the quality is excellent. When we get home, my husband carefully cuts all the tendon attachments off the chicken breasts and freezes them in individual bags.  $87.57 11:30 a.m. \u2014 My husband makes us scrambled eggs, bacon, fresh avocado toast, strawberries, and grapefruit. I wash and prep all the veggies I bought yesterday and make us a bunch of saut\u00e9ed spinach to go with our brunch. 3 p.m. \u2014 We spend the afternoon watching '80s action movies and I research London restaurants. We have five nights in London, and we want to eat a different Michelin star restaurant each night. I carefully look at each menu, scroll through Google photos of the restaurants, read independent reviews, and Google Map the distances from our hotel. I try to get my husband interested in the details, but he just says \"yes\" to everything. Some of the restaurants I can already make reservations at; others won't accept them until 90 days out. I mark my calendar to remind myself to make them as soon as I'm able. I also research coffee spots for the mornings and pick a few good bakeries for lunches. Advertisement 5 p.m. \u2014 My husband peels a few oranges and creates a smorgasbord of cheese and crackers for a snack. I continue my London planning. It seems a bit obsessive, but I find that we're far more able to take advantage of the places we visit due to my planning. I try not to lock us into anything except dinner reservations (usually after 8 p.m.) so that if we find something more interesting than what I've planned for us when we get there we can easily do that instead. But through my research, I learn the geography of the places we visit and have a better framework to understand any new options I discover once we're there. 8 p.m. \u2014 I defrost white bean and farro soup for dinner, and make us avocado toast to go with it.

I read a new book on the sofa until my husband wakes up and makes us pancakes for breakfast. He usually makes a double recipe and eats a leftover pancake for breakfast every morning. We're creatures of habit. 11 a.m. \u2014 We head out for an easy three-mile hike; the weather is beautiful, but as usual in the Bay, its pretty crowded. We're both from the East Coast and miss the seasons, and we hope to move back within the next three to five years. In our area, any house that's big enough for a family, nice enough that we'd want to live there, and with a 20-minute commute in each direction will cost us $1.5 to $2 million. The down payment we'd need to make to bring our mortgage payments into the realm of feasibility would be almost all of our savings, so we'd rather move back east.

The restaurant serves small plates for sharing, so we order as a group and split everything. We each start with a drink and then share a really wide variety of food; it's all amazing. We end with two desserts: a chocolate lava cake (that I could have eaten by myself), and an olive oil strawberry shortcake that I passed on after a bite.

I get the second round of drinks for M. and me and tip $2.  $14.10 1:40 a.m. \u2014 Our friends have slowly filtered out, and M. and I are the last ones standing at the bar. We decide it's time to pack it in and head home. M. suggests stopping at the Taco Bell drive-through on the way home, and it's impossible to say no. I feel bad because I've had so much fast food this week, but there's nothing like TB to cap off a long night of drinking. I order a Chalupa and Nachos Supreme. M. pays.

Can't fall back asleep, so I mindlessly scroll through my phone for a while. 8:30 a.m. \u2014 M. wakes up and we chat for a bit, and then he gets up to get the day started. He has rehearsal today for his show later tonight, and he needs to get moving. I lay around in bed for a while longer and end up falling back asleep. 11 a.m. \u2014 I wake up for real and force myself out of bed. I drink a big glass of water, take Advil, and give M. a see-you-later kiss before he leaves. Then I get into the shower and listen to an episode of T he   Generation Why  podcast while I shampoo, condition, and shave. 1:30 p.m. \u2014 I need a little pick-me-up, so I drive to Starbucks. I have a reward on my account, so I order a venti iced blonde latte with an extra shot and a sausage and egg sandwich ($3.75). On the way back home, I stop to get get gas and a car wash ($51.43). I try to keep the exterior of my car fairly clean at all times (let's not discuss the interior), and I enjoy the ritual of going through the drive-through car wash.  $55.18 Advertisement 3 p.m. \u2014 After eating my lunch and watching TV, I remember that I'm almost out of moisturizer. I recently took to Instagram to crowdsource ideas for a great moisturizer for oily skin, and a friend of mine recommended hyaluronic acid. I pick up her recommended brand from Amazon: Asterwood Naturals. Then I take a nap. I'm going to M.'s show later tonight and I want to have enough energy.  $16.90 5:30 p.m. \u2014 Finally force myself to get up after snoozing my nap alarm a million times. I wash my face and get dressed for the concert. I decide to get a little more made up than usual, so I use pretty green eyeshadow in addition to my regular face of makeup, and then hop in my car and head to Hollywood. 7:05 p.m. \u2014 I almost never spend time in this part of town, and everyone and their mother is out and about today. I refuse to pay $15 to park in a lot, so I spend 20 minutes driving around looking for a meter spot on the street. I find one about four blocks away from the venue.  $4 7:25 p.m. \u2014 I meet up with M. and a couple of our friends at a restaurant next door to the concert venue. I'm hungry, so I get a slice of pizza to hold me over until we all go out for a larger dinner later. I also order a tequila and pineapple juice (they're out of grapefruit) at the bar, and the bartender charges me the shot special price, which is nice.  $12.96 Advertisement 8 p.m. \u2014 We make our way to the venue and M. pays the cover charge for me. We see four bands play and they're all great \u2014 but sadly, the band that plays before M.'s goes over their allotted set time, so the venue cut M.'s band's performance short. It's a bummer, but they roll with the punches. We're exhausted and hungry by the time the show is over, so we decide to bounce right away and get a late dinner before heading home. 11:15 p.m. \u2014 We all decided earlier in the night that we wanted to chow down on wings after the show, so we're sad when we discover that Big Wangs has permanently closed! After Yelping, we find Hot Wings Cafe, and we're all excited to get out of the shitshow that is downtown Hollywood. I order a 12-piece basket of wings, half hot and half lemon pepper. I know I can't eat it all, but I plan to save half for lunch tomorrow.  $20.03 12:30 p.m. \u2014 M. and I get home, smoke a bowl, and spend a long time talking before getting too tired to function and falling asleep.

I also send a text to check in on a friend who's going through a rough time because her grandmother recently passed away.  $4.99 Advertisement 9 a.m. \u2014 I clock in on my laptop and get started answering some emails. M. has a baseball game this morning, so he wakes up shortly after me and starts getting ready. I had to park pretty far last night because we got home so late, so when he's ready, I have him drop me at my car so I can move it closer. I pick up a coffee at Starbucks before going back home.  $3.95 12:15 p.m. \u2014 I'm starting to get hungry, so I reheat my leftover wings, which I eat while styling options for clients. 12:45 p.m. \u2014 My little brother calls me for advice. His landlord is raising his rent on him, so he's looking for a new place. We talk awhile about the apartment he looked at today and its pros and cons, and also just catch up a little bit on life. We make plans to get together next weekend. 3 p.m. \u2014 I start to get a little hungry, so I eat the Trader Joe's salad that we have in the fridge. Curried chicken salad is one of my very favorite foods. 4:20 p.m. \u2014 I've finished up with all of today's clients, so I start on a dangerous mission: browsing The RealReal. When I do buy designer, I pretty much only stick to consignment items. I'm a big fashion archive person, so it's really fun discovering pieces that I remember seeing on the runway five, 10, or even 15 years ago \u2014 now for much more affordable prices. I also hunt for gifts for my friend's upcoming baby shower. I'm thinking of getting her some beautiful indigo-dyed bibs and a cool teething necklace. 5:15 p.m. \u2014 I'm hit with a wave of sleepiness, so I take a 30-minute nap. 6 p.m. \u2014 I clock out and put away my work computer. I'm already thinking about dinner and I know I have a free delivery code on Postmates, so I scroll through my options and decide on Fatburger. It's delivered in about 20 minutes, and I eat while starting  The Confession Tapes . I can't believe it's taken me so long to watch this, because I'm immediately hooked. The way each side of the story is presented is completely gripping.

I eat oatmeal every day and today it's overnight oats with chia and flaxseeds, kefir, banana, and maca powder. I studied abroad in Peru and began eating maca there. It's growing trendiness \u2014 and price \u2014 in the U.S. annoy me, but I love the taste and energy-boosting properties. I also drink half a mug of black coffee. 8:30 a.m. \u2014 Arrive at work after an easy, 25-minute commute. For some reason, the roads are abandoned on Fridays. It makes me sad to think everyone else is working from home but at least my drive is more enjoyable.

We discuss the latest updates with my caseload and she helps me troubleshoot issues. My work mainly consists of helping people apply for SNAP (food stamps), maximizing their SNAP benefit, and working with the government when they mess up people's cases (which is often). It's an ideal first job in the anti-hunger field. I snack on peanuts and a  Cara Cara orange . 1:30 p.m. \u2014 Take a lunch break with a colleague (and only work friend) after helping her translate a client call into Spanish. Most of my colleagues are middle-aged women, which is lovely, but it's nice to have someone my own age around. I reheat miso soup that I made last night. It is fantastic and filled with yummy things: sweet potato, zucchini, seaweed, rice noodles, salmon, and a soft-boiled egg. I tell my friend about the college sophomore I made out with last weekend at a concert. 5 p.m. \u2014 Arrive home after leaving work at 4:30 p.m. and leave for the gym. Majorly wipe out on the ice with my first step out the door. Once I get to the gym, I try running on the treadmill and give up after half a mile. My ankle is off and my knee hurts from my fall. I look down and already have a big bruise. Get on the bike instead and jam out to reggaeton. 7:15 p.m. \u2014 Walk home from the gym and throw together leftover tofu and eggplant with sliced baby cucumber and arugula for dinner before jumping in the shower. Advertisement 8 p.m. \u2014 Make popcorn on the stove and eat it while texting my family on our group chat. My parents are in London and I am jealous. Try calling my sibling; they rarely pick up but I leave a message saying that I miss them and love them. They're in college in Chicago so we don't get to see each other much anymore. I pour myself a glass of leftover white wine, but it seems to have gone bad, so I pour it down the drain (something I wouldn't have done a year ago). I drink homemade kombucha instead and watch  Cable Girls , which a friend recommended. 10:30 p.m. \u2014 Two episodes later, I'm loving this show! I wash my face and brush my teeth and crash. Crazy Friday night. Daily Total: $0", "day_two": "Day Two: 8 a.m. \u2014 Wake up without my alarm! I make oatmeal and grind coffee beans in my ancient Magic Bullet and pray my roommates don't wake up. I'm babysitting very energetic kids today and need the caffeine. 12 p.m. \u2014 I love babysitting these kids because their mom is home the whole time, so my main job is entertainment while she can step in if things get out of hand. She heads out with the three-year-old to buy pretzels from a local bakery for lunch. Both kids want to share their delicious-smelling pretzels with me but unfortunately, I am intolerant to wheat. (I have IBS and mainly follow a low-FODMAP diet.) I eat Swedish Fish, though, while we play a candy-related game. Advertisement 1:30 p.m. \u2014 Walk home with a check for $64 in my pocket. I wanted to stop by the gym but all of a sudden I feel awful. I was slightly feverish in the middle of the night last night and now am freezing even though it's 53 degrees outside. I dress entirely in fleece and heat up more leftover miso soup. 3 p.m. \u2014 My roommate comes downstairs looking awful; she thinks she has the flu \u2014 we're a house full of sickies. I walk to Rite Aid before I feel even worse and buy a thermometer, chicken soup for her, and a small body wash. Take my temperature and it's 96.9 degrees \u2014 normal.

I can't sleep, but I lie in bed for two hours. 7 p.m. \u2014 I'm feeling good enough to meet a friend for dinner, but not good enough to walk the half mile there, so I shamelessly Uber. My Pool ride is $2.65, but I have credit on the app, so I don't pay anything. Have a great time catching up with my friend and congratulating her on a new job. I order pad see ew with chicken and it's pretty good.  $12.65 8:30 p.m. \u2014 Feeling a lot better, so I walk home and stop at the grocery store on the way.

More is more in my book, so I cook the oats with cinnamon, cardamom, and frozen blueberries, and then portion it into jars and add chia, flax, hemp, and sunflower seeds, banana, peanut butter, maca, and Greek yogurt. Run downstairs and grab the Sunday  New York Times . I almost cancelled my subscription when it increased to nearly $11 a week, but ended up negotiating a 50% off rate. Reading the paper is one of my favorite parts of the week and totally worth it to me. 1 p.m. \u2014 Get into yoga pants and then settle in for a \"Yoga with Adriene\" video. I love her and find her YouTube videos to be almost as good as real classes. 2:15 p.m. \u2014 Make a quick lunch of eggs and homemade corn tortillas that I make out of masa. Also throw together a huge arugula salad with cucumber and carrots. 3:30 p.m. \u2014 My roommate comes in toting a package that arrived for me. It's a belated birthday present from my aunt: a mandoline slicer! I call to thank her and we chat about an upcoming ski race we are both participating in. Then I make sweet potato chips to test out the mandoline. They're delicious. Advertisement 4 p.m. \u2014 Do a free online practice LSAT test. I'm not even sure if I'm going to take the LSAT, let alone apply for law school, but I'm considering it and I love word problems! I also put a pot of brown rice, lentils, red pepper, and kale to cook on the stove. 5:50 p.m. \u2014 Get dressed for real this time and walk 10 minutes to meet my mentor at a Japanese restaurant I've been excited to visit. We connected on the phone when I started looking for jobs in the nutrition/anti-hunger field and started meeting up after I moved to the Boston area. She's the president of a micronutrient supplementation organization, so we always have interesting conversations about international versus national nutrition issues. We also chat about life. I love having her support. I order a tuna donburi bowl with miso soup and seaweed salad. It's pretty much my favorite dish ever. We split the bill and I pay $24.22, including tip.  $24.22 7:30 p.m. \u2014 Arrive home, where my roommate is cooking with friends I haven't met yet. I make coconut milk hot chocolate with peppermint schnapps for everyone and we talk about all sorts of things. My dad also stops by to give me my new license plate tabs, which were sent to my parents' home in a different state. He works in Boston during the week and returns home on the weekends, which means I get to see him a lot. 10 p.m. \u2014 Watch more  Cable Girls  and drink ginger tea.

I have a meeting with some of our partner organizations this morning, so I get to leave a bit later than usual. 9:30 a.m. \u2014 There was supposed to be coffee and breakfast, but it's not here. People are panicking a little and eating the hamentashen someone brought from home. Finally, at 10, Panera coffee and bagels arrive. I pour myself coffee and drink it black. We discuss issues we've been seeing and the upcoming Purim donation. 11:30 a.m. \u2014 Drive to my office where there's just enough time to heat up my lentils and rice before our weekly staff meeting. 2 p.m. \u2014 Go straight from one meeting to the next. I volunteered to be part of the Purim party planning committee. I'm not Jewish but I thought it would be fun to learn more. I snack on Greek yogurt with kiwi and peanuts during the meeting. 4 p.m. \u2014 Take a break from faxing documents and calling clients to make peppermint tea. I've been putting off ending things with a boy I met on Hinge and finally send him a text. We've only been on three dates so I feel like it's nicer to blame things on my breakup of nearly a year ago rather than tell him I'm just not feeling it. 5:15 p.m. \u2014 Arrive home after a stressful commute and go for a slow three-mile run, followed by a quick yoga routine. Heat up miso soup for dinner. Advertisement 7 p.m. \u2014 Take a shower and put on my zebra print onesie. My roommate has a friend over and I have a great time hanging out with them and vetting Hinge dudes. I am supposed to have a date on Thursday with one of them, but my roommate's friend (who is a gay man) warns me that he's not going to be cute in person. My roommate said he's always right. I feel mean ghosting but am not sure what to do. 9 p.m. \u2014 Roommate's friend keeps pouring me glasses of Two-Buck Chuck cabernet sauvignon. It's actually really good. I decide to give the Hinge guy a chance. After the friend leaves, I head to bed, a bit too buzzed for a Monday night.

A partner organization is releasing a study linking food insecurity to health costs in Massachusetts. For my job, I also help contribute to SNAP policy at the state level, so it's important that I show our support. 8 a.m. \u2014 Eat my usual breakfast while I read the news and get upset about the world, so I research a possible trip to Spain to visit a friend instead. Look up flights online. I might be able to swing it! I've saved up almost 100,000 miles on Delta, which helps. Then I do yoga and get dressed in a get-shit-done outfit, including pearl earrings. Advertisement 9:25 a.m. \u2014 Walk five minutes to the train and use my CharlieCard, which is already loaded. I don't get a monthly pass because I drive to work and don't use the train enough to justify it. 11 a.m. \u2014 The State House event is wonderful! There are many inspiring speeches by people on every side of this issue: the government, nonprofits, research organizations, and even a woman who receives food assistance. There are also lots of people I know here, which is great. I chat with a guy who's part of my SNAP Coalition and he ends up inviting me to get a drink at one of my favorite breweries, so I give him my number. It feels good to meet someone in real life after so many online disasters. 11:55 a.m. \u2014 Reload my CharlieCard and jump back on the train. Stop by my apartment to grab lunch, then drive to work.

I have a key so I can use the apartment as well as the gym and pool. Sometimes I have people over on the weekends, which is a fun change of pace. There are Girl Scouts selling cookies at the train station, so of course, I have to stop. I was a Girl Scout and chat with them about camping for a while. I buy a box of Thin Mints for my dad.  $5 6:30 p.m. \u2014 Give my dad the Thin Mints and head to his fancier-than-mine gym to do 15 minutes on the machines followed by a one-mile run. Then we head out to meet one of his friends for dinner at a place around the corner. 7:30 p.m. \u2014 Order a butternut squash and goat cheese salad with grilled chicken. It's great! My dad and his friend split the bill. 8:45 p.m. \u2014 We move on to the dive bar next door for trivia. My dad and his friend do it most weeks and are typically the oldest ones there by far, so they recruited me tonight for a millennial's wisdom. It pays off, as the first question is about Justin Timberlake and I know the answer immediately. My dad buys a round of Long Trail Ales on tap for all of us, and then his friend buys me another that I split with my dad. Advertisement 11:15 p.m. \u2014 We get so close to winning! I stop by my dad's to grab my bag and then call an Uber home. I don't really like taking the train this late in this part of town. The Uber Pool is $16, which is crazy.

It's incredibly helpful because many of my clients have been through chronic trauma, and now I have a better understanding of why and how I should react. They have mandarins, so I eat one and sip on coffee. 11 a.m. \u2014 Snack on peanuts and drink peppermint tea.

I'm not sure what their policy is here and whether the creamer is for sharing, so I pour quickly and sneakily. 11 a.m. \u2014 Head out to my office and snack on peanuts once I get there. 12:30 p.m. \u2014 Some of us do a \"Yoga with Adriene\" video at lunch on a big projector screen. It's such a good midday reset. 1:30 p.m. \u2014 Heat up more lentils and rice, and eat chia pudding with tons of cinnamon that I made this morning. The Hinge guy cancels our date and asks to reschedule. I take this as a sign and don't respond. 3:15 p.m. \u2014 My coworker brings over gluten-free cookies that were up for grabs in our kitchen. I look at the ingredients and I can actually eat them! Sometimes it's hard following the low FODMAP diet because I have to turn down most things, so I'm very happy. I save them for later. 4:35 p.m. \u2014 Leave work and stop by Trader Joe's on my way home. I buy Joe's O's, toilet paper, eggs, organic chicken breast, ground turkey, cocoa powder, Greek yogurt, a spaghetti squash, canned crushed tomatoes, coconut milk, feta, frozen blueberries, blood oranges, zucchini, carrots, kale, spinach, lemons, limes, a potato, bananas, and ginger tea.

Hurrah, it's Saturday! Have a bit of a lie-in and catch up with my boyfriend, who has been away for work for the past week. He makes coffee while we listen to the  Today  radio show and get ready for the park run. It's a lovely day and we leave at 8:50 to get to the start line. There are so many people here today \u2013 and we try to participate every Saturday morning if we can. While it might not be the first thing I want to do on a Saturday morning, it sets me up for the day and makes me feel pretty smug. Trying to improve my personal record each week is a good incentive \u2013 and it's free! 10:30 a.m. \u2014 Feeling fab, although my run today was 10 seconds slower than last week's personal record. Maybe next week? I take a long, luxurious shower and then have a breakfast of peanut butter and mashed banana on toast with another cafeti\u00e8re of coffee. Manage to fend BF off my second slice of toast and he makes himself more; he is an eating machine. Usually, we have our Ocado groceries delivered at this time each week (it's sort of like Whole Foods, but online), but because I wanted to make a nice meal for BF when he returned from his week away, I had everything delivered a few days ago. We spend about $120-$140 on food shopping per week, which comes out of our joint account. Advertisement 12 p.m. \u2014 Pop into the center to pick up a bag that was being mended at L.K. Bennett. This is the second time I've bought this bag, and the strap broke. Not a happy bunny. Sadly, as it was three years since I'd bought it last, I couldn't quite wangle a replacement or a refund. Tip: Take things back within six months of purchase if they're broken (a.k.a. don't buy stuff and leave it at the bottom of your wardrobe for two years). However, they did fix it for free. You win some, etc. While we're out and about, we pop into Hatchards bookshop and buy three greetings cards ($10.10). We also pop into M&S to buy eggs because I have grand banana bread-making plans ($5.60).  $15.70 2 p.m. \u2014 Home! And HUNGRY. (BF perhaps more than me.) Thankfully, we have a pile of leftovers from last night's North Thai feast, which I made with a spice delivery box we were gifted when we booked a holiday. We have coconut chicken noodle soup, spicy pork sausages, prawn crackers, pickled pak choi, pak choi leaves, cucumber, and baba ganoush. Yum! We settle in on the sofa and my boyfriend watches rugby while I attempt to plan a friend's hen do. We're nearly there but organizing so many other people is a challenge! She is one of my best friends, though, and I am really happy to be doing it for her. The wedding is this summer and we are all really excited! Wed-min is briefly interrupted by a phone call from my best friend, who shares some very exciting news with me. Whooping ensues. Advertisement 4 p.m. \u2014 Whooping over, I scour the internet for shorts to buy for our forthcoming trip to Costa Rica. My boyfriend and I are going for two and a half weeks, and I can't ruddy wait! I haven't had a proper long holiday in a long time. I find a pair on sale from Lululemon and buy them ($19.71), only to be dismayed 20 minutes later when I receive a message telling me that my order is cancelled. Apparently, they are out of stock. They need a better stock notification system! Brokenhearted, I continue to scour the web but, alas, none are as good. I decide to leave the shorts for now. 6 p.m. \u2014 Food time! We're going to have to be quick, as we're heading to my boyfriend's friend's birthday party later. I heat up leftover fish curry I made during the week. We're still pretty full from our lunch feast so after eating, I hastily slap makeup on and get changed. We leave bearing a bottle of gin from our booze shelf and take the train way down south of the river. We get to the party and my boyfriend's friend is making cocktails (read: pouring glasses of tequila). I have a great time! His friends are great but the tequilas prove a little too much for BF's friend and he throws up in the garden. 3 a.m. \u2014 Tequila, limoncello, espresso martinis, and god knows what else consumed, it's time to go home. Party host is passed out in an armchair. We share a taxi up to North London with a friend. The ride makes me pretty nauseous, which I mistakenly vocalize, and then spend the rest of the (ruddy long) taxi journey convincing the poor driver that I will not vomit all over his car. Mission accomplished. We arrive home, no chundering done. BF pays for the Uber, though to be honest, I can't remember ordering it anyway. I wash my face, brush my teeth, and fall into bed with a bucket on the side. I don't throw up, but the world is spinning.

BF brings me Berocca and coffee, and I doze whilst listening to BBC Radio 4. (It makes me feel safe.) 9:30 a.m. \u2014 I finally haul myself out of bed and make an avocado toast and green tea, hoping it will sort me out, and continue scouring the internet for shorts. None are as good as the ones I couldn't buy yesterday. Also, why are all the things I like are so blooming expensive?! I resist any ridiculous leisurewear purchases and put on my running clothes. 11 a.m. \u2014 Finally out of the door and running around the park. Being outside feels good, although I don't feel like I have much in my legs! That'll be the tequila. I am cheered on by all the lovely dogs out for their walks in the park. Once I'm home, we eat baked sweet potatoes, blue cheese, and salad bits left over in the fridge. I also open a tin of stuffed vine leaves in the cupboard because I am hungry! 2 p.m. \u2014 We settle on the sofa again and BF watches rugby. I have a delightful nap, and then get up at about 5 p.m. and start making the aforementioned banana bread. BF assists as sous chef. Still hungover, tired, and therefore hungry, we make a very classy dinner of chicken Kiev (food of the gods), some sort of vegetable-y quinoa packet, and salad-y bits. We then have our Sunday night ritual of watching C ountryfile  (no apology), but this time with delicious chocolatey banana bread. Advertisement 7 p.m. \u2014 We make our lunches for the next day (falafel salad) and get our bags organized for the week. I spend a bit of time researching further exams I want to take, and see if I can find a way of getting work to fund them. We get into bed at approximately 8:30 p.m. (PARTY CENTRAL), and read our books until we pass out. It's been a busy weekend. Daily Total: $0", "day_three": "Day Three: 5:15 a.m. \u2014 Alarm goes off. I'm supposed to go to a body pump class at the local gym but I'm not feeling it. Decide I'll go for a run instead. Reset alarm for 6:30. 6:30 comes. Still not up for it. Boyfriend gets up and ready for work and brings me coffee. 8 a.m. \u2014 Boyfriend leaves for work. I appear to still be in bed. Decide I'm going to work from home today. I finally haul myself out of bed at 8:45 and go for a lovely long run in the beautiful sunshine. 9:30 a.m. \u2014 Back home and showered. I eat peanut butter banana toast and drink coffee, and then sit at my desk (a.k.a. dining room table) going through my emails, still feeling Saturday night. Today is going to be fun. The two-and-a-half-week holiday that I have coming up means that there is a slightly scary amount to do before then. Not helped by a judgment that came out last week, which completely threw off the case strategy of a related matter I'm dealing with. Advertisement 3 p.m. \u2014 I think about taking a walk in the sunshine, but it doesn't happen. Grab my lunch out of the fridge and work whilst I munch. 7 p.m. \u2014 Still working but think it might be time to make dinner. Boyfriend has meetings in another town today and will be home late, so I start on with dinner without him. I make tofu pad Thai but realize we're out of noodles, so am excruciatingly middle class and use quinoa instead. Settle down with a bowl of quinoa Thai on the sofa watching  Don't Tell the Bride . So trashy, but so satisfying. Boyfriend is finally home, so I warm up some of my masterpiece for him and we catch up on our days. We make our packed lunches for tomorrow (leftover quinoa Thai, salad, tzatziki, and stuffed vine leaves) and have banana bread and herbal tea.

I get up, chuck my gym clothes on, throw my lunch in my bag, and am out the door and on the bus! Get to the gym at 6:30, and do gentle jogging on the treadmill. Then I take a 30-minute killer HIIT class. Afterward, I shower off and meet some girlfriends for breakfast at 7:30. I order green baked eggs and a cappuccino and we catch up on life. We realize we haven't seen each other for ages, so we get our calendars out and make plans to meet for dinner on the following Monday, as this is the only time that will work before I go on holiday.  $20.15 Advertisement 8:45 a.m. \u2014 I'm in work mode and there is a lot to do. I prepare evidence (which I love doing) and field emails and calls from clients. 12:45 p.m. \u2014 Stop for lunch with some colleagues. We go down to our firm's caf\u00e9 and catch up on our weekends and lives. Back at my desk, I see that I'm scheduled to do a presentation on the judgment I mentioned earlier. Add this to my increasingly long to-do list. Still working on the evidence. (I will be for days.) Text my boyfriend to ask when he'll be home. He replies saying he'll be home before me, so I task him with making pancake batter. Decide I'm not going to make it until dinner, so I go down to the caf\u00e9 and buy a slice of banana bread. I feel a bit sorry for the poor banana bread sitting at home, but at least the one I made is better.  $3.50 7:15 p.m. \u2014 Take the train home, where it's pancake time! I had grand plans of making fancy pancakes but by the time I get home, I can't be bothered to make a fun sauce. We settle for cheese, sriracha, and cured beef that Ocado had in its flash sale. BF has been a superhero and baked salmon that was in the freezer for lunches whilst he was waiting for me to come home. I repay the favor by making salmon salad for lunch for tomorrow. Too full for more banana bread. We're in bed by 10:30 and asleep pretty soon after. Advertisement Daily Total: $23.65", "day_five": "Day Five: 5:45 a.m. \u2014 I have been awake since 4:45. Excellent. Finally get out of bed when my alarm goes off at 5:15, chuck lunch into my bag, put my gym clothes on, and head to a barre class at 7 a.m. It's tough, but enjoyable, especially since the teacher is playing really aggressive hip-hop. Once I'm showered and dressed, I walk to work. 9 a.m. \u2014 Breakfast time. I usually get a free coffee at the gym, but the machine is broken (it tries to serve me a cup of hot milk), so down to the office caf\u00e9 I go. To be fair, they have really good coffee, but it's just a bit pricey for an office coffee shop. I get a coffee and a bircher muesli. Back at my desk, I do my usual email-fielding and evidence prep.  $5 2:30 p.m. \u2014 Meeting with my boss and a junior to discuss evidence in this tricky case. Boss is clearly as flummoxed as I am by the recent judgment. We spend three hours trying to work out what to do. Thankfully, our meeting is in the partners dining room, so I take advantage of the free coffee, sweets, fruit, and biscuits, and leave feeling slightly sick ... but like we might be getting somewhere with the case. 6:45 p.m. \u2014 Get back to my desk, write up a few drafts, and then realize it's nearly 7 p.m. 8 p.m. \u2014 Finally home, and BF has defrosted and heated beef stew from the freezer, which we eat with brown rice and parmesan on the top.

I struggle through as best as I can and am grateful when it's over! Into the shower and get dressed. 7:45 a.m. \u2014 At my desk, preparing my presentation for lunchtime today. Joy. Make a pit stop at the office caf\u00e9 and get a cappuccino and a bircher ($5.05). Take a break and see that Lululemon's \"We Made Too Much\" page has been refreshed \u2014 and they have excellent shorts. In my size. AND IT'S PAYDAY!

It goes fine, although I hear myself volunteering to do a case note for distribution to clients. Sure, yes, I'll do that. Have a really interesting discussion about various issues that the judgment has raised, and get back to my desk at 1:30 to eat my lunch. I receive a text from my dentist reminding me about the I checkup booked for this evening. Good job they did, as I had forgotten. 2 p.m. \u2014 Someone left a pile of candy out in the office. The dentist trip later is not enough to deter me from polishing off approximately 10 delicious, chewy sweets. My mouth hurts from the sugar. Advertisement 4:30 p.m. \u2014 A colleague swings by and asks if I would fancy a coffee. I could do with a break, so I thankfully agree. We pop out with another colleague and I buy them both coffee since they usually buy mine. Get a lemongrass tea for myself, as I am coffee-d out. I eat roasted nuts and dried apple with it, and get back to the office for an in-depth chat with a partner about a case we're working on.  $12 6:45 p.m. \u2014 Crap, it's time to go to the dentist! I have been going to a private dentist for a few years now because I just couldn't find an in-network one in London whom I trusted. The one I've found is amazing and not completely extortionate, the only problem is that the office is down in South London. I hop on the Thameslink and get there by 7:30. Have a great chat about how I'm a tooth grinder (and wear a fairly heavy duty mouthguard at night \u2013 sexy stuff), but often find myself clenching my jaw during the day. She does an X-ray of my teeth and says that I haven't done myself too much damage, but perhaps I should try yoga or meditation. I had prepaid part of my appointment, so only pay for the X-ray.  $25 8 p.m. \u2014 Hop on the train, then Tube home, and arrive to find that my boyfriend made one of my favorite guilty pleasures: Linda McCartney deep-filled country pies, with sweet potato chips and baked beans, plus mayo and sriracha on the side. Food of the gods! Then it's our usual routine of making packed lunches for the next day, packing bags, and getting in bed by 10.

I get home and see that BF left me half a cafeti\u00e8re of coffee. I boil the kettle, pour half a cup of black coffee, and top it up with hot water. Then I start working, reading through the legal news and case law updates and tackling my inbox. 11 a.m. \u2014 The door buzzer sounds: It's Ocado! Run down the stairs and let the delivery man in. We ordered mixed peppers, chicken thigh fillets, little gem lettuce, zucchini, onions, mozzarella, blueberries, asparagus, yogurt, radishes, green beans, spinach, cherry tomatoes, milk, cheddar, carrots, avocados, sugar snap peas, a cucumber, leeks, hummus, baby sprouts, chicken sausage, pancetta, flaked almonds, quinoa, granola, crumpets, canned chickpeas, eggs, roasted nuts, canned butter beans, sweet potatoes, artichoke hearts, gochujang chili, Braeburn apples, chicken gyoza, and edamame beans. Every week, we also include a $7 contribution (which Ocado matches) to a local food bank. This food ($109 total) will last us for the week, plus some meat I have in the freezer from previous Ocado flash sales. I'll probably use the few hours I have free on Saturday to do some batch cooking for the week. 11:30 a.m. \u2014 I'm hungry, so I make avocado toast. The avocado is slightly on the unripe side and mashing it up is a bit of a challenge but I'm game. I sit down and get on with further work. This morning, it's time to go through all of my bills. It's painful as usual but it has to be done! I have a call with a junior about a case we are working on, and work through the drafts the juniors sent through to me over the last few days. I love this part of my job because I really enjoy working with others and the teaching aspect of it. It's so rewarding to see people improve and develop. It also keeps you on your toes \u2013 you have to know your stuff! Advertisement 3 p.m. \u2014 I'm hungry. It's time for my packed salmon salad. I found dried wakame in the cupboard last night, so I put that in it too. Salad is followed by a cup of tea and banana bread.

I get changed out of my comfy clothes and into a nice dress. Put on minimal makeup, and we walk down to the restaurant in Stoke Newington. I have been wanting to try this place for ages \u2013 it's a seafood tapas restaurant, serving seafood sourced from Scotland. We gorge on oysters, garlic prawns, patatas bravas, squid, tortilla, tomato bread, fried eggplant, and pig cheeks, and manage to fit in a cheeky chocolate brownie for dessert. We share a bottle of wine, too. At about 11 p.m., we roll home, make herbal tea, and get into bed.

I am feeling so much more sociable today. My city only has buses as its public transport, which is a bit of a bummer, because I miss the metro and am not a fan of the jarring bus adventures here.

I slowly get up and get into my pre-work routine. I was too lazy to make my lunch the night before, so I whip something up now. I get a call from the guy I declined dinner with the other night \u2014 a butt dial, he claims \u2014 and then he proceeds to ask how my weekend was. I leave later than usual. 8:45 a.m. \u2014 I roll into the office and get settled in for a long day of sitting at a desk. There are no English classes this week and everyone is gearing up for the last day of school. I have things to work on and online shopping to browse, so I keep pretty busy as I sip on my second cup of coffee. Advertisement 11:30 a.m. \u2014 My co-teacher tells me it's time for lunch \u2013 an hour earlier than our usual lunchtime. We meander down to the cafeteria and, to my surprise, it's full of first and second graders. My heart melts because they're so cute! Luckily, my spicy leftovers don't make me sweat and I eat my lunch pretty quickly. 2 p.m. \u2014 I start thinking about how I'd like to get involved in volunteer work in Ulsan, so I do some research. I find an organization and shoot them a message. I browse online more and am quite surprised by how quickly time is passing today. In addition to the volunteering, I would also like to enroll in a Korean language class because living here and not knowing much Korean is a major missed opportunity. 4:40 p.m. \u2014 I try to get out of work as soon as possible and head straight to the gym. I feel super hungry and a little worried that my workout won't be great because I haven't eaten enough. I block out these thoughts and push my mile on the treadmill in record time; it feels easy. It really is all in your mind when it comes to pushing yourself at the gym. Unfortunately, I learned these no-B.S. mentality tricks long after I swam and ran in college and high school. 6 p.m. \u2014 I leave the gym and go to the store to pick up my grocery staples, and make a sweet potato, salad, and tofu back at home. I feel motivated, so I clean my apartment and put all of my clean clothes away. I don't know how I always end up with so many clothes to put away after only a few days!  $18.32 Advertisement 9:30 p.m. \u2014 I wind down and listen to music. I watch an episode of  The Amazing Rac e again and chat with a friend. 10 p.m. rolls around and I pass out with the plan of heading to the gym first thing in the morning. Daily Total: $18.32", "day_six": "Day Six: 6:30 a.m. \u2014 Guess who didn't go to the gym this morning! I sleep another 15 minutes and then give my mom a quick call. Finally, I get up at 7:10 and start getting ready. I speedily get ready and have time to do chores around my house, and yet still head out the door a little late. 8:45 a.m. \u2014 No class again today, so I have to invent things to keep busy. I will try to sift through all of the tax information I have received to give to my mom, who is an angel and is helping me with my taxes while I'm overseas. One of my co-teachers is having a rough morning and I see her crying. The teachers here rotate the grades they teach every year, and she went from teaching fifth-grade English to first-grade homeroom. First grade is the very first year of Korean elementary school, so she will have to teach them all of the basics. I know she'll be great at it, but I wish I could make her feel less sad about the switch. 12:30 p.m. \u2014 We head to lunch. I feel like a bottomless pit today and leave unsatisfied after I finish my lunch. This leaves me a bit worried because I definitely did not pack sufficient snacks today. I try to pull myself together and forget about my stomach's rumbling by busying myself with work. Advertisement 3 p.m. \u2014 I am wildly hungry and overall do not feel that well this afternoon. I need to reconsider the amount of food I bring to work. I take the last package of nuts in our office (and the only snack left) and munch on a banana. The last hour of work is dreadful \u2013 time seems to pass so slowly. My co-teacher tells me that we have a work dinner to celebrate the last day of the school year, but I decline because she tells me only 20 minutes before the day ends. I tell her I already have plans for the evening. 5:30 p.m \u2014 I skip the gym today because I really felt ill after work today. I start making dinner at home and listening to tunes. Tuesday nights are the best because I get to watch  The Bachelor . I'm not too fond of Arie but I continue to watch this season because I live for reality TV. 9:30 p.m. \u2014 I am reverting back to my grandma ways this week and spend the night watching YouTube videos. Tell myself that I'm going to the gym in the morning and pack my gym bag to avoid any excuses! Daily Total: $0", "day_seven": "Day Seven: 6:30 a.m. \u2014 I get up with a hint of reluctance and get ready for the gym. I pack my breakfast and lunch and then walk over. I am so happy to see how bright it is getting at 7 a.m. now; it is making me stoked for spring and summer and I need to get OUT of my winter slump. Hit back and biceps at the gym. I shower, curl my hair, and do my makeup at the gym before going to work. Advertisement 8:35 a.m. \u2014 Immediately upon getting to work, I crack open my overnight oats. I am so hungry this morning. Make coffee in the office and realize I have the whole place to myself today. Luckily, tomorrow is the first day of a four-day weekend. I text a Korean friend about our plans to meet for dinner later. 1 p.m. \u2014 Honestly, I have no idea what I have done today, but time is passing quickly. Start chatting with a guy I met this summer \u2013 boredom at its finest. I have purposely left my wallet at home for the past two days because I sadly cannot trust myself with online shopping. Also, going to the gym this morning was a great idea because I haven't fallen into my post-lunch slumber. 5 p.m. \u2014 I run to the store to get food and go for a walk. I pick up pickles (a strange craving), apples, carbonated water, and Tteok-bokki. Surprisingly, I don't see any of my students on my walk to and from the store. I get home and redo my makeup and fix my hair before going out to dinner. I end up having a weird reaction to a product I use. Of course this happens right before I meet someone for the first time!  $10.02 7:30 p.m. \u2014 So, so hungry. I meet a new Korean friend for dinner. We get pasta and pizza and chat about life in Korea, life in the U.S., languages, and gun control. We plan to play beer pong and darts at the local bar the next time we meet. He tells me that in Korea, it is customary to treat a new friend to dinner, so he pays the bill. I tell him I will buy him drinks when we meet next. Advertisement 10:30 p.m. \u2014 I relax at home and chat with friends from the U.S. No work tomorrow, so I think about how much I can sleep in in the morning. And just like that, I fall asleep.

We are getting engaged soon and are beginning to combine our finances as we get ready to pay for a wedding (and eventually a house) together!", "day_one": "Day One: 6:30 a.m. \u2014 I start the day with a cup of blackberry tea and a scoop of collagen protein. I usually hit the gym by 5:30, but I slipped and twisted my ankle over the weekend and am trying to give it a rest. The warm weekend weather melted the snow but with temps dropping overnight, I figure I should get up and going so as not to be late to work due to bad roads. 8:15 a.m. \u2014 My intention to get to work on time failed, but with my executives out of the country, no one seems to notice or care and I go about my morning routine. I heat my overnight oats in the microwave for a minute (blueberries, oatmeal, unsweetened coconut milk, and collagen protein) and grab a mug of hot water to make tea at my desk. Advertisement 10 a.m. \u2014 I am hungry but am trying to figure out if I am just eating out of boredom. Weeks when my executives are traveling are always slow. I snack on a few gluten-free cheddar crackers for a snack from my food drawer. I keep a designated food drawer to keep me from spending all my money and calories at the office vending station. 12 p.m. \u2014 My mom texts to ask if I want to come over for lunch. I grab my lunch from the office fridge and head to her house. About two weeks a month, I order prepared lunch meals from a local meal prep company at $10/meal. My mom and I chat and I eat a not-so-satisfying veggie burger and sip a cup of ginger tea. Spending time with my mom always brightens my day. 2:30 p.m. \u2014 Work is very slow today. I dive weeks deep in a fitness vlogger's YouTube account, something I have no actual interest in. It's about time for an afternoon snack, so I pull a protein peanut butter cup out of my drawer and try to eat it without making a crumbly mess on my keyboard. 4 p.m. \u2014 My cousin texts my mom and I that she's nearby for an appointment and asks if we want to meet up for happy hour. I dip out of work an hour early and meet them both for a cocktail and a cheese plate. Cheese = my favorite part of life. I pick up the tab and tip because my mom raised me and my cousin is a newly-employed teacher  $28.11 Advertisement 7 p.m. \u2014 My boyfriend, Chris*, heads out of town tomorrow for the remainder of the week, so I make dinner tonight at his place. We eat salmon, broccoli, and brown rice while we catch up on each other's days. After we clean up the kitchen, I help him pack for the week. He hates traveling for work and I do my best to lighten his mood. We have a very fun black-tie event the evening he gets home and both of us are very much looking forward to it! It's an automotive industry event often referred to as AutoProm. 9:30 p.m. \u2014 I make a cup of Sleepytime Tea, turn on some music, and fall asleep wondering if Chris knows where his bowtie is.

I forget my morning tea and collagen and feel very foggy this morning. 8:30 a.m. \u2014 I am somehow late to work again today. I put my overnight oats in the microwave and grab a mug of hot water for tea. I dread days without my executives. I feel so unfulfilled at work without a lot going on. At least my oats taste like a warm blueberry muffin. 9:30 a.m. \u2014 I walk to the office fridge and pull out a Wella Bar (Awesome Almond!), reminding myself to enter this in MyFitnessPal. My gym is doing a six-week challenge and we're in the second week. Advertisement 10:55 a.m. \u2014 More boredom snacking. I pull a bag of SmartPop out of my desk. 11 a.m. \u2014 I am now craving Chipotle. I brought lunch to work, but my craving gets the best of me. After browsing the nutritional content online, I place a pick-up order for a steak burrito bowl, sans rice.  $8.32 12 p.m. \u2014 I leave the office and head to a quick-change oil shop. My car has been reminding me to change my oil for over a week now. I usually hate getting my oil changed because the staff is so unfriendly and tries to up-sell me on everything, but today is my lucky day, I pull in and the staff is friendly and efficient. I am out of the shop with an oil change, a new air filter, and a refill on my wiper fluid in under 15 minutes. I make a note to leave a Google Review for the wonderful service  $88.11 12:30 p.m. \u2014 I stop and pick up my burrito bowl. Oh, how I love Chipotle. I start to head back to the office but see a big red Target sign looming ahead on my right. A self-proclaimed shopaholic, I recently evaluated my finances and am trying to get my shopping-for-sport under control. Today, I resist the urge and am very proud of myself. I think of my savings account increasing and wonder when Mint will send me another congratulatory email on my newly developed spending habits. 12:33 p.m. \u2014 Just past Target, I spot a new health food market and pull in to get a bottle of kombucha. In a severe lapse of judgment, I gave up coffee for the month of January and have been replacing my afternoon coffee craving with a bottle of kombucha. It's on sale, two for $7. I also grab a Pink Lady apple and a container of pre-cut mixed berries.  $13.78 Advertisement 7 p.m. \u2014 I'm craving something for dinner but, not wanting to do much about it. I stop by my parents' house and there's a pot of homemade chicken noodle soup on the stove, so I help myself. My dad and I end up asking Alexa the most ridiculous questions we can think of. Turns out, the love of Alexa's life is R2-D2. Can't blame the bot for that! I love spending time with my family. I always leave feeling so blessed and peaceful. 8 p.m. \u2014 I get home to a package in my mailbox! I walk into my studio and drop everything in the middle of the kitchen floor to open up my package. It's grain-free granola I ordered from a Chicago-based blogger I follow. 9:30 p.m. \u2014 After tidying my studio, making a list of a few things I need for home, and talking to Chris on the phone, I finish a cup of decaf tea and go to bed.

The group fitness instructor is a no-show (weird, but I've never liked her) so everyone bands together and kicks ass with a group workout on the fly. I am not usually hungry immediately following a workout but this morning I consider my gym shoe a viable snack. Advertisement 7:30 a.m. \u2014 Out the door a little early for work. With Chris out of town, I realize how little I keep at home. I go to the market to pick up a few things to keep at the office, including frozen blueberries, unsweetened coconut milk, and Siggi's yogurt (two for $3!). I charge $10.48 to Chris' card. I get to work just before 8 a.m. and mix in a handful of the grain-free granola I got last night in with the yogurt I bought. So good! I resist immediately eating another yogurt with more granola and text my girlfriends who also work out at my gym. We bash the instructor who didn't show this morning; nothing like a good group-text vent session. 10:15 a.m. \u2014 My executives are on their way back and clearly purchased Wi-Fi during the flight; my inbox is on fire. It's the fire and chaos that makes me love my job. I grab a mug of hot water and make a cup of blackberry tea, glad to escape boredom snacking this morning. Another protein peanut butter cup should get me through until lunch. 12 p.m. \u2014 Mom texts me just as I'm walking out the door for lunch. She asks if I'm bringing dresses over to try on. My Rent the Runway delivery for AutoProm should have arrived by now, but I got a delayed notification from UPS. I decide to go see my mom anyway. We eat chicken noodle soup and warm chocolate zucchini muffins as we talk about the family cat (whom I think is possessed). I stop at my favorite coffee shop on my way back to the office and get a blueberry tea with the gift card Chris got me for Christmas. He calculated what one coffee or two teas a week would be for a year and put it on a gift card. My most thoughtful and appreciated gift this Christmas! The staff asks how my coffee moratorium is going, I sigh and say it seems to be getting harder. They remind me I'm halfway through the month and a coconut milk latte isn't far off in my future. Advertisement 1 p.m. \u2014 My inbox is full and I've got a full list of tasks to complete, including trying to resolve a hotel room fiasco for an upcoming international trip. Moving my executives to a lesser hotel halfway through a conference our company is sponsoring? Not happening on my watch. 4 p.m. \u2014 George*, my favorite executive, touches down in Detroit and is in full effect. I convince him to delay coming into the office because he is never that effective post international travel. I open the second bottle of kombucha I bought yesterday and debate leaving work early to grab my Rent the Runway rental, but after tracking online, I realize it still hasn't been delivered. Officially getting worried. 5 p.m. \u2014 I have enough time to swing by the store to pick up a few things I didn't buy yesterday. A few staples turn into a lot of impulse purchases, like a dessert-flavored tea. I hate myself for this. I consider putting it all on Chris' card because I know he wouldn't mind, but I know these are all for my place and put it on mine. At the checkout, I take out $20 in cash for tips I'll need on Friday.  $45.16 6 p.m. \u2014 The spray tan studio is packed for AutoProm. I'm easily the youngest person there by 20 years but I don't mind; the older ladies are hilarious. While I am waiting, Rocksbox sends me an email reminder to return my items but damn it, I love one of the necklaces and I have an account credit to use! (I canceled my subscription when I set up my budget at the beginning of the month.) It's only $30 after I apply my $29 account credit. I get sprayed down and purchase a bottle of tan extender.  $85.78 Advertisement 8:30 p.m. \u2014 My Rent the Runway is finally delivered and disaster strikes: Two dresses don't fit and the one that does has a massive rip down the side. I call Rent the Runway in a panic and get a customer service specialist who couldn't care less about my plight. After a 20-minute call and full-on customer service 'tude, I hang up and try to focus. I open up my laptop to search local department stores' current stock online. I realize my internet isn't working and remember I canceled my Wi-Fi when my provider tried to jack my bill up by $50 over six months ago. (Shows you how often I'm really at my place.) I use my cell phone as a hotspot, saying cheers with a cup of tea to unlimited data from my work phone plan! 10 p.m. \u2014 I've purchased three dresses I feel lukewarm about for store pickup tomorrow from the larger mall about 40 minutes from me ($603.25 on Chris' card). I figure I can take a longer lunch tomorrow to pick them up. That gives me four hours after work if those dresses don't fit to hunt something down near me. I wish I lived somewhere with better local shopping. I call Chris to update him on my plight and promptly fall asleep. I've always appreciated my ability to sleep even when I'm stressed. Daily Total: $130.94", "day_four": "Day Four: 7:40 a.m. \u2014 Out the door a little early. Forget to make tea. I want to wash the salt and slush off my car before I get to work. Fueling female driving stereotypes since 2005, I nearly cause an accident pulling into the car wash when I forget to put my car in neutral.  $6 Advertisement 9 a.m. \u2014 I am so distracted by the dress situation that I start drinking my mug of hot water without a tea bag. George is in the zone and I am glad he is back. He encourages me to take a long lunch to pick up my dresses. I grab my yogurt from the fridge and granola from the drawer and am excited about breakfast because it tastes so good. 1:30 p.m. \u2014 Back in the office after my lunchtime sprint to pick up my dresses. I buy two salads from Whole Foods on my way back for George and me. ($11.58 expensed) 3 p.m. \u2014 My salad sits on my desk untouched. I open my drawer looking for something else but don't find anything appetizing. I take a LaCroix from my fridge stash instead. Why am I so wasteful? I let George know there's an extra salad in the fridge for tomorrow's lunch since I won't be in and he's not the best at feeding himself. 7:30 p.m. \u2014 After work, I put on a fashion show for my mom, baby brother, and sister-in-law. We all agree on a dress and I go to the local mall to get a pair of shoes for the new dress ($135.66). They are pricey but I've needed a good pair of black pumps for a while. After, I meet one of my besties for dinner. He recently started working at my company (yay!) but with our schedules, it's been hard to even get lunch together. I am glad to catch up with him and am getting more and more excited for AutoProm. We're fluid about who picks up the tab. I think it's my turn, so I pay ($49.04).  $184.70 Advertisement 9 p.m. \u2014 My usual decaf tea, phone call with Chris who is at the airport ready to fly home, and off to bed.

By 11 a.m., I've returned $450.56 worth of dresses to Chris' credit card and another $173.86 for the shoes I purchased for my original dress to my personal card. I am feeling good about this as my new dress and shoes ultimately cost me less than what Rent the Runway would have. While I'm still bitter, party of one, when it comes to Rent the Runway, I did get a full refund and a credit for my next rental. 3 p.m. \u2014 With my hair ($35 plus a $10 tip) and makeup done (free as I am a VIP Rouge member at Sephora, meaning I spent $1,000 at Sephora in the last calendar year), I swing by Chipotle to get Chris and me something to eat ($15.58) before we head out.  $60.58 5 p.m. \u2014 We arrive at the AutoProm pre-party. Chris had a heated work call on the way and I worried it would prevent him from enjoying the evening but upon arriving, we happily run into several friends and enjoy free food and drinks as the night begins! Advertisement 11 p.m. \u2014 After hours of fun, food, and drinks, we venture out on our own. Everyone thinks AutoProm is about the cars. It's not \u2014 it's about the unparalleled people-watching: the glam, the weird, and the just plain ugly. I love it! We hop to a few of our favorite bars, including an Irish pub with $1 jello shots. Chris picks up the bar tabs and I pay for the Ubers.

Chris picks up the bill. 1:30 p.m. \u2014 After I drop off Chris at his car, I stop at a coffee shop and get an overpriced cup of tea before I take a lazy drive through the city with my heat blasting and windows down.

After a quiet dinner, we are both still very hungover and craving something sweet.

I am so moved by the sermon, I tear up during the prayer. 12:30 p.m. \u2014 On our way to my parents' house for family brunch, Chris and I take a detour to a nearby bar for one cocktail. He is feeling very stressed and anxious today and I know it's always helpful to sit and talk it out. His career is incredibly fast-paced and high-stress, so I try to be considerate of that as much as possible. 1:30 p.m. \u2014 My mom makes an amazing spread for brunch as per usual: two different quiches, cinnamon bread, sausage, bacon, and fruit. We catch up with my family and I suspect that my youngest brother is recovering from a night of shenanigans since he seems slightly hungover. Sunday brunch with my family is one of my favorite parts of every week. Advertisement 3 p.m. \u2014 Chris and I planned to stop at Costco on our way back to his house but we completely ignore our responsibilities for the day and go to the next town over for Sunday Funday instead. We hop to five different bars, have a drink at each, spend hours talking, and split an app at the last one. Chris picks up the tabs. 7 p.m. \u2014 We're back home. Friday night was a blast but there's nothing like quality time with just the two of us. I check the fridge and confirm I have enough food to make it through Monday, though I'll have to stop at Costco after work tomorrow night. I don't like running errands after work, especially on Mondays, but I know Chris needed a relaxing day today. I hope the week ahead isn't too difficult for him. 9:30 p.m. \u2014 I make a cup of decaf tea and add a splash of honey, which naturally means I down it in a matter of minutes.

In the long run, the cost comes out to about $1 per cup of delicious coffee \u2014 way cheaper than what we would pay at a caf\u00e9. 12 p.m. \u2014 My morning is spent watching  This is Us  on Hulu, washing and putting away the first six months' worth of baby clothes we received at our shower (what does one do with all the tiny socks?!), cleaning the house, and munching on potato chips with homemade hummus. There's no food at home so we decide to go to the farmers' market for lunch and groceries. Before ordering lunch, we buy what we need/want from the market: red fife sourdough bread which has only three ingredients, apple spice jam, persimmons, and mandarins.  $30 Advertisement 1 p.m. \u2014 We share three pupusas for lunch from one of the booths at the farmers' market. I try to convince my husband to get dessert at a bakery nearby but we both resist the temptation.  $9 1:30 p.m. \u2014 After the farmers' market, we head over to Trader Joe's to do our weekly grocery shopping. This week, we're making beef and bean chili and Southwestern chicken salad so we get ingredients for those, plus food for our dog, cereal, milk, eggs and snacks.  $84 7 p.m. \u2014 I spend the rest of the afternoon nesting, cooking chili, and baking spice cookies that are similar to Russian ones I've been craving but don't have all the ingredients for. Time for dinner! I can only eat a small amount before getting full on account of my stomach being squished. After dinner, my husband suggests watching a Christmas movie to which the answer is always \"Yes!\" We turn on the lights of our tree, have tea and cookies, and watch  A Christmas Prince . It's incredibly cheesy, but that's to be expected. The spice cookies are good but don't totally satisfy my craving. 9 p.m. \u2014 We get ready for bed and read parenting books until we fall asleep. I'm currently reading  Simplicity Parenting  about \u201cusing the extraordinary power of less to raise calmer, happier and more secure kids.\u201d Three years ago, we donated about 75% of our possessions using the KonMarie Method and earlier this year, I switched over to a capsule wardrobe. Babies and kids have a tendency to attract a lot of stuff, but we want to stay mindful of what kinds of toys, clothes, etc. we keep for him. My husband is reading a book on meat smoking; he bought a smoker a couple of weeks ago, which I suppose is like his baby until the human gets here.

I eat oatmeal for breakfast and get ready for work. Before leaving for work, I pack a lunch of bread from the farmers' market, cheese and veggies, plus a couple of fruits. My husband has made us coffee so I take mine to go. Before work on weekdays, he drops our dog off at his parents' house so she can play with their two dogs. He heads out around the same time as I do. 10 a.m. \u2014 I have a meeting now to discuss and finalize the marketing strategy for an upcoming fundraising event, but I sneak a couple handfuls of popcorn and trail mix into my mouth as my coworker walks in. My coworkers have gotten used to me eating pretty much all day, which is a great perk of pregnancy. 12 p.m. \u2014 I get a Facebook message from my husband about a miscommunication with his lunch meeting at work today. Apparently, he's having lunch with his coworker tomorrow instead so now he needs to buy something else to eat. They have a cafeteria at his office so he gets a chicken pico de gallo wrap.  $8 5 p.m. \u2014 There are only 30 more actual work days left before I head off on maternity leave. With so much to do and not enough time, it feels like a race against the clock. Before I realize it, the day is over and it's time to go home. I stop by the library my dad works at to pick up  Creativity, Inc.  by Edwin Catmull and Amy Wallace. I'm trying to get in as much reading as I can before our baby arrives. The last time I visited my dad at the library, they had donuts. No such luck tonight. Advertisement 6 p.m. \u2014 As soon as I get home, I put the chili on the stove to heat up and eat a snack of potato chips and hummus until my husband gets home. Then, we have dinner together and take the pup for a walk. I love how excited she gets even if we take the same route every time. 8 p.m. \u2014 Time for tea, cookies, and relaxation! I decide this is a good time to look through my baby shower photos and pick the ones I want to print to send with my thank-you cards. Shutterfly wants my email address and they send me a gift of free 50 prints and a sheet of address labels. An hour later, the battery on my laptop is running low and the charger is nowhere to be found. We've been having construction done to our house, including getting a dishwasher installed which will be so helpful with a baby. The problem is that random things have been getting moved or lost. While I lose my mind trying to find my laptop charger, my husband orders me two replacement chargers. I swear pregnancy brain is not to blame for this one!  $36 Daily Total: $44", "day_three": "Day Three: 6 a.m. \u2014 A fun way to wake up is to get punched in the bladder from the inside. I highly recommend everyone try it sometime. On the bright side, the puppy hops into bed for morning cuddles. For breakfast, my husband and I eat cereal. I finish getting ready for work and pack the same bread, cheese, veggie, and fruit lunch as yesterday. A couple of days ago, I used older coffee beans to make a batch of Mexican cold brew coffee (by adding a cinnamon stick to the coffee grounds and water) so we both take a cup of that to go. It tastes amazing and was so easy to make. My husband's company is treating him to lunch today. Advertisement 10 a.m. \u2014 I take a break from work to munch on popcorn and trail mix and finish placing my Shutterfly order. I can't decide between two designs of address labels so I buy both (but only have to pay for one). I also have to pay for shipping.  $17 12 p.m. \u2014 Someone heated up Italian food in the kitchen and now I really really want pasta. But alas, I shall stick with my own lunch. 4 p.m. \u2014 I leave work a little early today because my husband's company is treating everyone and their plus ones to see the new  Star Wars  movie together. We both meet up at home then drive to the theater together. I was hoping we could have dinner at a nearby Italian restaurant but we don't have enough time. Chipotle bowls will have to do.  $16 9:30 p.m. \u2014 On our way back home, the gas light of my car comes on and my husband stops at the station to fill it up for me. The closest one to us is also very expensive so he doesn't fill it up all the way.  $30 Daily Total: $63", "day_four": "Day Four: 6 a.m. \u2014 It's my husband's birthday! He's at the gym so I let our puppy outside and start making oatmeal for breakfast. I wanted to make something more festive, but we don't have the right ingredients. He gets back a couple of minutes after I start making breakfast. We eat breakfast together and I give him his birthday present (a watch I bought from Nordstrom during my 10x points day in early December) to open before we get ready for work. I made sure all of our Christmas shopping was done in late November/early December because I'm a Gemini and don't mess around with Mercury retrograde. Advertisement 9 a.m. \u2014 Once a month, the Champions for Change program has a meeting at our office to discuss ways we can improve the food systems in the low-income neighborhoods we serve so that residents have access to healthy, affordable food options. While it's not required to attend, I sit in on these meetings with my intern because it's something that I'm passionate about. After the meeting, the leader gives out the  Local Flavors  cookbook with recipes using farmers' market ingredients. A few of the pages that I quickly glance look delicious and I can't wait to try them out. 12:30 p.m. \u2014 There is leftover lunch from a departmental meeting and I scan the buffet to see if anything looks appetizing. The dietary restrictions that come with pregnancy can get frustrating, like when lunch is catered and the only options are deli meat sandwiches or salad with blue cheese. I settle on a couple of bread rolls and potato to supplement the leftover chili I brought, which makes for quite the hearty lunch. My husband is getting treated to lunch yet again. Lucky duck! 4:30 p.m. \u2014 I leave work and drive to the historic core of downtown to meet my husband and in-laws for his birthday dinner. I have about an hour to kill before our reservation so I decide to stop by The Last Bookstore. Parking is a hassle because I used up all my cash at the farmers' market but I finally find a lot nearby that accepts credit cards.  $8 Advertisement 6 p.m. \u2014 Resist the urge to buy all the books. I want to buy something to support the bookstore because it's one of the last ones left in the city, but it's too difficult to decide under pressure since my husband will be here at any minute. He's decided to pick me up so I don't have to walk to the restaurant in the dark and the rain. We go to Little Sister, an Asian fusion restaurant. The waitress recommends ordering two dishes per person so we get fried beef meatballs, two types of spring rolls, shaking beef, black rice with seafood, pork confit noodles, and spicy lemongrass fried chicken. She warns us that we've ordered one or two dishes too many but we're planning on eating leftovers for tomorrow anyway. Plus my unborn child counts as a fifth person, right? 8 p.m. \u2014 We are stuffed but ready for dessert. Bottega Louie is across the street so we walk over. We order a hazelnut brownie, tiramisu, and a Napoleon for dessert. I sneakily ask the cashier to put a candle on the tiramisu so we can sing \"Happy Birthday.\" It was all so delicious and my in-laws generously treated us to both dinner and dessert. Daily Total: $8", "day_five": "Day Five: 7 a.m. \u2014 It's been cold lately (by L.A. standards) so our dog hasn't wanted to go outside as early. I let her out and make oatmeal for myself and my husband while he prepares breakfast for our dog. We eat in bed with the dog for family cuddle time. (Also because there are covers to keep us warm.) When I get to work, there are chocolate-covered strawberries! The holidays and pregnancy are a pretty good combination because I feel no guilt. Advertisement 1 p.m. \u2014 For lunch, I eat leftovers from dinner last night. Peanut butter cookies have magically appeared on my desk. During my break, I also place a large Amazon order of nursing bras, a birthing ball, an aromatherapy diffuser with essential oils (all of which I plan to pack in my hospital bag), and a baby tub and hamper for the nursery.  $205 4 p.m. \u2014 After work, I stop by Whole Foods 365 to pick up a rotisserie chicken for dinner and ingredients for the dish I'm making for our office holiday potluck tomorrow. It turns out we need way more random stuff than I anticipated. I end up also buying broth, ground allspice for those Russian spice cookies I've been craving for weeks, cornstarch and bananas (for banana pudding that I've also not been able to stop thinking about), and avocados. The cashier asks me when I'm due and if I know what I'm having. We somehow have a five-minute conversation about gender stereotypes.  $77 5:30 p.m. \u2014 When I get home from the grocery store, I munch on Trader Joe's white truffle potato chips (which are incredible) while I start making a savory goat cheese, corn and herb pudding for the potluck. I found the recipe in the farmers' market cookbook I got a couple of days ago and wanted to try it out. While shopping, I thought that macerated balsamic berries would be the perfect addition to this dish. It all tastes good to me but my husband tells me not to subject my coworkers to weird pregnancy food combinations. I decide to save the berries to eat at home. While the pudding is cooking, I make Southwestern chicken salad by heating up a can of refried beans from Whole Foods, shredding the rotisserie chicken and adding those, avocado, and harissa salsa, to the top of organic shredded cabbage slaw from Trader Joe's. Advertisement 8 p.m. \u2014 After dinner, we watch  How the Grinch Stole Christmas  while eating a dessert of macerated balsamic berries topped with granola. And by \"watch,\" I mean I fall asleep 20 minutes into the movie while my husband endures a film he had no intention of watching in the first place. Daily Total: $282", "day_six": "Day Six: 6 a.m. \u2014 Most days, like today, I am in awe of how lucky I am. My husband is making us giant pancakes and coffee while I cuddle in bed with our dog. I love him! We top our pancakes with the berries I made last night and watch  Hell's Kitchen  while eating breakfast. It's the blind taste test episode in which contestants have to guess what herb or spice they're tasting (with mashed potatoes as a base) while blindfolded. The red team is doing extremely poorly to the point that I scream at the TV that they should get their \u201cchef license\u201d taken away. The irony of judging cooking show contestants from the comfort of my own couch doesn't escape me. 8:15 a.m. \u2014 Since it's the Friday before Christmas and we have a half day at work, I am able to show up to the office a little later than usual. I gather my potluck contribution and head out. 11 a.m. \u2014 It's time to go to the potluck and I have successfully completed no work today. Everyone is in a very chatty mood. There is so much food and my coworkers keep insisting I cut in front of them in the buffet line because \"the baby needs to eat\" \u2014 even when I go back for seconds. I enjoy half a slice of pizza (I split a slice with my coworker), two types of salad, fried chicken, a tamale, potato chips, a chocolate peanut donut and a glass of Martinelli's sparkling cider. After lunch, I get to go home and roll back into bed. Advertisement 6 p.m. \u2014 My parents and brother have come over so we can go to dinner for my husband's birthday together. It's another shared plates type restaurant so we order a ton of food: two types of toast, one with burrata and persimmons and another with taleggio and caramelized onion, farro salad, brussels sprouts, Moroccan-spiced fried chicken and fries, pork and veal braised meatballs, pork cheek ragu with pappardelle and black pepper cavatelli with kabocha squash. To our surprise, we finish everything. The desserts look delicious as well so we order a chocolate hazelnut tart and apple cinnamon cake to-go. This restaurant was quite pricey for only five people so we split the bill with my parents.  $118 10 p.m. \u2014 My family spends the rest of the night playing Cards Against Humanity, laughing hysterically, and eating dessert with tea. It's such a lovely end to a wonderful day and an even better start to the holiday weekend.

I can't decide if I'm hungry yet, but I eat a small bowl of Raisin Bran cereal anyway. It helps to keep things moving along if you know what I mean, and I can use all the help I can get right now in that department. My husband lets our dog out. 8:45 a.m. \u2014 Our puppy (who is a white Husky Lab mix) wants to be let back inside but I discover that she has been having way too much fun digging. Her entire face and her legs up to her stomach are covered in mud. On top of that, we have to get ready to go to brunch. We cajole her into the shower and wash her before showering ourselves. By some miracle, we are out of the house in time to make it to our reservation at Redbird in Downtown L.A. Since my husband's birthday is so close to Christmas, we usually do one big activity to celebrate, like kayaking in San Diego or taking a winery tour. Being pregnant doesn't allow for much craziness, so we decided to have a fancy brunch date at a place we've been wanting to try for a very long time. Advertisement 9:45 a.m. \u2014 We make it to the restaurant in record time. The roads are gloriously empty because the L.A. transplants have gone back home for the holidays. The valet is $12 but we find street parking instead.  $4 10 a.m. \u2014 We walk the half block to the restaurant and are seated right away. I've kept a list of dishes I want to try for at least a month so ordering is a cinch. We get coffee, a brioche donut, biscuits with red-eye rabbit gravy, Basque baked eggs, and a waffle for dessert. The staff was so sweet and put a candle in the waffle for my husband to blow out.  $84 11:15 a.m. \u2014 After brunch, we stop by Trader Joe's to get groceries for the Christmas dinner we're hosting for our families. My husband has been obsessively researching barbecue recipes and he's excited to take his meat smoker for a spin. We're going to make ribs with a cherry BBQ sauce, baked beans, and mayo-less potato salad with lemon, red onions, and parsley. My mother-in-law is planning to bring a regular salad of some sort and my brother is baking rolls or cornbread. I'll figure out something for dessert tomorrow depending on what I'm craving. For dinner for seven people (and hopefully leftovers), we did pretty good cost-wise.  $120 12 p.m. \u2014 We've only been gone for two hours but our puppy got so bored while we were away that she tore up all of the mail that was delivered, which appears to have included a holiday card. She looks so proud of herself that we can't even be mad. I spend the next few hours playing with her, putting away laundry, and sorting through my Amazon deliveries. Advertisement 4 p.m. \u2014 My husband and I take our dog for a walk so she doesn't get restless. When we get back, he serves her dinner while I make ours. I make a pasta sauce by cooking down the rest of the organic cabbage slaw and adding rotisserie chicken, tomato sauce, marjoram and thyme. Then I boil some whole wheat penne, pour the sauce on top and sprinkle with Parmesan cheese. I also make garlic toasts with the last few slices of bread from our farmers' market haul earlier in the week. This impromptu dinner turned out much better than expected. The fresh herbs make all the difference. 7 p.m. \u2014 After dinner, we play with our puppy outside for a bit. Then I make myself a cup of red raspberry leaf tea and read on the couch with the dog while my husband plays some video games. Alone time is going to be so much more difficult to come by once the baby is here. I use this time to set up a meeting with our doula, research ridiculously expensive childbirth classes, and fill out my 2018 planner with to-do items and due dates. With a baby on the way, I feel like I need to work extra hard to stay on top of everything. My husband joins me on the couch shortly after and we talk about the prenatal class and our first family vacation. I read him the most notable parts of the parenting book while he cuddles my belly.

She also eats a banana and drinks a glass of milk. 10:45 a.m. \u2014 My son has soccer at a local park. It's usually earlier in the day, but it's unseasonably cold here so they pushed the start time one hour. I watch him drill and then do a scrimmage for 25 minutes.

I make coffee and grab a cereal bar for my son and we head over to the course to cheer on three friends who are running. It's freezing but my kid loves it. We high five the runners and try to yell inspiring words. There is music, police cars flashing sirens to encourage the runners, friendly dogs, and neighbors.

I go to Amazon and present him with two options; he chooses the cheaper ones! I also throw in a few of pairs of fuzzy socks for myself. (I normally would randomly order a pair of socks, but I love them. Especially during this cold snap.) The purchase is $70.89, but we have an Amazon credit card, so I am able to pay with points. I continue to answer work emails and keep the news on in the background. The highways are very icy and the mayor is asking everyone to stay off the roads. I hope it's better tomorrow but it is doesn't look like it will be at the moment. 12 p.m. \u2014 Make lunch for the kids and nibble on salami and crackers for me. 1 p.m. \u2014 Take several conference calls and try to cram as much work in as possible during my kids' nap time. I also log on to the Harris County Toll Authority website to pay a toll I missed last week. (I was driving my husband's car and he does not have an E-ZPass.) It's $3.25 ($1.50 + a $1.75 surcharge); so that this does not happen again, I sign him up for an E-ZPass and put $40 in the account. They'll send us the pass in the mail. We've been in Houston for almost 10 years; it's time!  $43.25 5 p.m. \u2014 For dinner, my husband made a meat sauce with pasta and roasted carrots. It was delicious but I am exhausted and overwhelmed. I give the kids a bath and then we have an impromptu dance party in the living room when my son asks Alexa to play one of his favorite songs. It's awesome to blow off some steam and the kids have a blast. Advertisement 11 p.m. \u2014 I go to bed. Everything is closed again tomorrow and I am dreading trying to work and manage my kids who, understandably, are suffering from major cabin fever. Finger's crossed that I make it. I have always respected moms who stay at home with their kids (read: work at home!), but that respect grows immeasurably when I have to do it myself. Reminder to be less grumpy at work...

I'm dreading trying to work and watching the kids at the same time. 12 p.m. \u2014 Make lunch for the kids, counting down the minutes until nap time. I've been trying to field work calls and emails while simultaneously entertaining the kids. I hope I can squeeze in a few hours of productive work during nap time while the kids are asleep. I also secure a babysitter for Friday night. We have an event related to my husband's job and I do not want to have to cancel. Proud of myself for being proactive! 5:30 p.m. \u2014 Our nanny is available to help out. We pay her $20 per hour and she is amazing. She takes the kids outside and my husband makes hotdogs and peas for the kids. We eat dinner, play, and have bath time. Nanny stays for two hours and helps us through dinner and baths; she's a lifesaver. I handle stories and teeth brushing for my daughter. My husband does the same for my son. We somehow get everyone into bed before 8 p.m., but my son's not asleep and I fear he'll resist bedtime.  $40 Advertisement 9:00 p.m. \u2014 Kids are finally asleep. I text with a friend who's a foodie, trying to decide on a restaurant to celebrate my dad's 75th birthday in a few weeks. I settle on a super-fancy Italian place that has rave reviews. I peruse the dessert menu and see cannoli, one of my favorites. I am sold! I book the reservation. I must remember to get a babysitter!

I help them get breakfast from the school buffet; the school charges $1 per child for breakfast. Everyone is settled and I am relieved that life is getting back to normal.  $2 7:30 a.m. \u2014 I need to get hardwood floor cleaner for my housekeeper. I purchase the cleaning supplies, she cleans the house, and when she runs out of something, she leaves me a note. I figure the stores will empty this time of day and I can knock it out quickly. I purchase the floor cleaner and also pick up a few essentials: bananas, yogurt, yogurt smoothies, salami, tortilla chips, cover up for a pimple on my chin, a loaf of bread, and fruit and croissants to share with my colleagues. I race home to drop off the groceries and head to work.  $50.30 8:55 a.m. \u2014 Take the toll road to get to work. The roads are filled with sand to combat the ice and a rock flies up and hits my windshield, leaving a crack. Argh. I'll have to try to find a glass repair place this weekend. Arrive at the office, very glad to be back in my routine. We have a cleanup day scheduled, so in between phone calls and emails, I sort through my files and decide what to recycle and what to keep. I munch on a croissant for breakfast.  $4 Advertisement 11:30 a.m. \u2014 My boss orders in Chick-fil-A as a reward for our cleanup day. I wolf down two chicken strips, a lemonade, and fruit before going to a meeting at another site. 3:30 p.m. \u2014 My meeting is over and I have approximately 30 minutes before my next round of conference calls. I chat with some of my clients and get a craving for chips, so I go down to the convenience store on the first floor of the building and buy Ruffles chips and a water. At least I avoided soda!  $3.32 7:30 p.m. \u2014 I wrap up my work and go home. I do not usually work this late but this week has been crazy and I needed quiet time to do deep-thinking work. I take the toll road again and call my husband on the way. Our nanny is there helping with the kids and my dad has stopped over for dinner. We agree to order Chinese food and we will have dinner when I get home.  $4 8:20 p.m. \u2014 I put my son to bed (he's still up) and then join my dad and husband for dinner. We share crab puffs, steamed dumplings, General Tso's chicken, beef with asparagus, and rice.

We have a jeans day today, so at least that part is easy. I also wear my favorite boots, a sweater, and a scarf; it's still freezing here. Everyone is dressed, show-and-tell items are selected, and I toss bananas in the kids' bags. I grab a Diet Coke to drink on the road. I don't have time to make coffee and I need the caffeine. 7 a.m. \u2014 I'm on the road and I take the toll road again. I listen to  Stay Tuned  with Preet Bharara, one of my favorite podcasts. He's the former U.S. Attorney from the Southern District of New York and always has an interesting take on current events. Today, he's interviewing the producer of a new Netflix series about corporate white-collar crime. I'll Google it when I get home; it sounds like something I would love to watch.  $4 7:40 a.m. \u2014 Arrive at the office and spend the next two hours on teleconferences. 10 a.m. \u2014 I have another meeting at 10:30 but I am feeling sluggish, so I decide to run down to the Starbucks in my building and get a chai latte. I usually get regular milk but given my lactose issues, I ask for almond milk instead. I did not mind it when I tried it last weekend but when I go back to my desk and taste it, it's disgusting. I try a few more sips and still hate it. It must be the brand of almond milk. I toss it and head to my next meeting.  $5.10 Advertisement 12 p.m. \u2014 My coworker asks if I want to eat lunch. I have yet another meeting at 1 and I should stay at my desk to answer some emails, but I decide I need a break and we agree to meet in the lounge area in 10 minutes. I run back down to the Starbucks and order a breakfast sandwich and a Diet Coke. (I realize I have a problem.) I love breakfast anytime of day! When I get to our lunch spot, I discover that the barista gave me two sandwiches. So nice. I probably should not eat both of them, but I do. Yummy, but I feel a little ill.  $6.45 5:15 p.m. \u2014 Leave the office. My husband and I have a party with his coworkers tonight and I want to get home and help him get the kids fed and ready for bed. I listen to the news on the way home because I am interested in whether the pundits think the government is going to shut down; Congress has until midnight tonight. I take the toll road. It's raining and traffic is terrible, and I do not get home until 6:30.  $4 7 p.m. \u2014 I get the kids settled in front of  Moana , their current favorite. I like the movie but at this point, the music is making me crazy. The babysitter arrives, I attempt to make myself look cute, and we head out the door. The party is fun, complete with a jazz band and delicious desserts. We mingle and before we know it, it's almost 10 o'clock. We head home and pay the babysitter for three hours of work.  $60 Advertisement 10:15 p.m. \u2014 My BFF calls. She lives on the West Coast and also has a small kid, so we have to coordinate if we're going to chat. (Sometimes I want to actually talk instead of text \u2014 Gen X.) She tells me about a job she is thinking of applying for and I give her the lowdown on my week. I miss her so much. We sign off and I watch the countdown to the government shutting down. We're on Central Time, so at 11 here, it's midnight in D.C. and Congress couldn't get it done. I decide to go to bed. This week was crazy exhausting but we made it!

Eventually, I get up and put on coffee for me and feed the cats. I pack my bag for the day with breakfast and snacks: coffee, my water bottle, Ezekiel bread with peanut butter, a banana, a yogurt, and a KIND bar. I live across the street from the restaurant where I work and arrive by 10 a.m. 3:30 p.m. \u2014 A fairly busy afternoon, but that makes the time fly. I order the special for lunch \u2014 a sliced turkey sandwich with goat cheese, arugula, sun-dried tomato pesto, and balsamic glaze.

I eat quickly during a lull and get ready to be on the floor as a server by 4 p.m. 8:30 p.m. \u2014 This night was dead. I debate ordering dinner at work, but I don't want to spend money. I am cut super early and pop into my house to feed the cats and change into comfy clothes; the perks of living across the street from work!

I feed the cats and apologize in advance to them that they will be confined to our bedroom while the plumber works. I do some work from home while he is here, which ends up being an almost three-hour job. I don't know exactly how much the job costs but I do know my landlord was not happy! 12 p.m. \u2014 I made a late breakfast (brunch? lunch?) of guac on Ezekiel toast and egg whites with Everything But The Bagel Seasoning (my favorite!) and cheddar jack cheese. I put in a load of laundry and tidy up around the house. 2 p.m. \u2014 I head to the grocery store for my weekly trip. I get cat food, cat litter, paper towels, toilet paper, a few candles, Clorox wipes, Banza pasta, sauce, bananas, avocados, rice cakes, tuna, yogurt, coffee, creamer, Ezekiel bread, peanut butter, and Oreos. I usually buy household items only once or twice a month so this week's bill is still more than I like to spend at the grocery store. Though my boyfriend and I live together we eat VERY different things, and with our work schedules we are not home for meals together very often. The food I buy is generally just for myself. I get a lot of the household items on sale and save over $12 with my store card.  $112.84 Advertisement 9:30 p.m. \u2014 It has been sleeting and snowing all night, so my night as manager-on-duty consisted of salting the walkway to the restaurant every half hour. I had a ton of staff show up late, a call out, and a lot of very unhappy servers because of how slow it was. I use my manager meal comp to get a salad to-go, because I plan to go to the gym after work. Better late than never. 11:30 p.m. \u2014 I get home from the gym and eat my salad with a side of Oreos. The girl who lives in the apartment above me texts me and I invite her over for a little. We are both crazy cat ladies and watch cat videos and play with my cats and talk about how much we love cats \u2014 normal things.

I'm getting a master's degree in nonprofit leadership, but after working in administration at a homeless shelter early last year, I don't know if I like nonprofit work after all.

They are so happy! 11:30 a.m. \u2014 I put gas in my car before driving to my volunteer orientation at the animal shelter. I get gas maybe twice a month. Because we live in town, the farthest places I drive to are the gym or the grocery store, which are each under two miles away.

Still, as much as I want to go shopping for home decor, as a born and bred New Yorker, I know shopping during rush hour is horrific \u2014 especially in Manhattan. I settle for going to yoga.

We spend the night stuffing our faces, drinking and joking, and not talking about our friend's recent breakup, which is what she wanted. We joke about our childhoods and our coworkers.

I cave, remove a few things from my cart, and order a silk sleep mask.  $48 5 p.m. \u2014 I finish work and check to see if any yoga classes are open in the next hour or so. I find one and grab my mat and water and power walk over since they have a strict late policy. I get a good spot and tune everything out. After yoga, I walk over to a wine shop. I love trying new wines and I usually just buy whatever speaks to me. Today, I spot the Tituss Burgess pinot noir and instantly grab it. I loved the character on the show (give Tituss his own show!) and I've been dying to try the wine. I use whatever is left on my Visa gift card, reminding myself to check the balance. 7 p.m. \u2014 I get home and realize I'm riding the cotton pony, which explains my mood. I get ready for a night in with wine, TV, and dating apps. I check dating apps from time to time just to see if I'm ready. As soon as I sign on, I realize I'm not and save myself \u2014 and my potential date's \u2014 time and sign out. I decide to binge-watch  Mad Men.  I'm upset it took me this long to give it a chance! Jon Hamm is everything. I get interrupted by a text from my phone carrier telling me my bill has been posted. I pay it right away or else I'll forget.

I listen to the  Bodega Boys  podcast to focus and laugh.  $1.75 5 p.m. \u2014 I didn't bring lunch so I decide on Mexican food for a late lunch ($5.31). I'm so swamped and focused that I lose track of time until it's 5:15 p.m. I look up from my workspace to see that my coworkers are already putting their makeup on for tonight. Apparently, I also received my MetroCard reimbursement check today. Yass! I put on my fancy face paint and we head out to Brooklyn. First stop is Croxley's Ale House for happy hour where we all pig out on quesadillas and chicken wings before bar hopping. While stuffing our faces, we try to plan where we'll go next, but it's evident that we're just going anywhere there's alcohol and good music. We split the bill.  $38.31 9 p.m. \u2014 Next stop is The Woods. They have an outdoor sitting area that's heated so we order drinks and walk over. By now, we're buzzed, joking around, and having a good time. A group of guys look over and buy us all fireball shots. They walk over and tell us they are heading to Baby's All Right a couple of blocks over; they invite us and we join them. At Baby's All Right, there's a live band finishing up a set but we still get to enjoy two good songs. The guys keep buying us more drinks. One of them is chatting with me, but I'm having such a good time I just start dancing with my coworker. We get more gin and tonics and start yelling when \"Bodak Yellow\" comes on. My coworker pays for my drinks since I paid for hers last time we went out. Advertisement 4 a.m. \u2014 Lose track of time and only realize it's 4 a.m. because that's when Baby's All Right closes. I decide that I must move to Williamsburg \u2014 but it'll be hard since I've been living in Manhattan all my life. Everyone starts calling their Lyfts; this time, I'm too drunk to sing along to anything, although my driver compliments me on my skin. I get home and double-cleanse my face even though I'm drunk. While doing so, I get a text from one of the guys asking me if I got home okay. I don't even remember giving him my number but the thought is appreciated.  $29.60 Daily Total: $69.66", "day_five": "Day Five: 3 p.m. \u2014 I wake up and drink water nonstop. I check my phone and see that my sister invited me out to eat.

I get to the place and catch up with my sister. I offer to pay my part but she refuses. 6 p.m. \u2014 I walk out of the train station and see a facial place I've been thinking about trying on the way home. They're known for their quick facials without the extra spa stuff, which is perfect. I need the pampering but I don't want a stranger touching my face for a long time. They usually don't take drop-ins but someone canceled, so I get lucky. I enjoy it because they don't push you to buy products. I walk out feeling refreshed and brand new.

I lay in bed with my laptop, read Money Diaries, and share one with my sister. (I suspect it's her, but she denies it.) I also start checking out grad schools. I will be extremely broke, but I know I have to do it. What's hard is that there's nothing I feel passionate about enough to go into debt for. I start watching  The Deuce  and for some reason get reminded that my humidifier hasn't been working. I check Amazon and find a new one right away. I pay with points. 6 p.m. \u2014 I go to see  The Disaster Artist  with a friend who is in love with James Franco; he offers to pay since he dragged me out on a Sunday. (Little does he know, I love James Franco as much as he does and would have gone willingly.) After the movie, I start mentally preparing for Monday and walk home while listening to an audiobook; it's terrible and I'm thankful it was free. 10 p.m. \u2014 I get home, shower, and mask. While I have my mask on, I boil water and set my Real Eats meal to cook. After dinner, I book my ballet barre classes for the week and watch  90 Day Fianc\u00e9  reruns. This show is hilarious and the fact that my friends and I discuss it in our group chat while watching makes it even better. I do some quick online shopping on Aritzia during commercial break and get a pair of mittens, a pair of jeans, and a few tops. Their clothes look great on me so it's my go-to store. After the reruns are over, I take some melatonin and go to bed wearing my eye mask.

Before going into the office, I get a green smoothie from Juice Generation. I get to work and try to do as much as I can so I can leave early. The guy I met in Brooklyn texts me and wants to hang out later this week; he offers we go see a stand up and I agree.  $7 3 p.m. \u2014 After work, I head over to Sephora to get foundation. I'm running low, and after years of trial and error, I finally found my perfect shade in Milk Makeup. It has SPF, which is always a plus. I have $40 left on the Sephora gift card I got for my birthday, so I only pay $2. I head over to barre class, which is very small since it's before 5 p.m. I prefer smaller groups because the instructors are more detailed and you get more one-on-one time.  $2 7 p.m. \u2014 I get home and gather my laundry to drop it off. I don't have a washer-dryer in my apartment, and although there are washers and dryers in my building, I prefer to drop it off to avoid folding. I shower and order sushi for dinner ($15.60). I eat while watching  Baskets  reruns and then decide to read until I pass out. My plans change when the guy texts me again. Maybe I really should give him a chance; he's already winning points by inviting me to a show and being a  Baskets  fan.  $42.60 Advertisement Daily Tchaotal: $51.60", "url": "https://www.refinery29.com/money-diary-new-york-ny-service-coordinator-salary"},

I hit snooze three times because I have had a lot of late nights recently and am still trying to get back into a school and work routine. After finally rolling out of bed, I drag myself to the apartment gym and find out I need a code. Grr. I know I need to work out so I settle for a beginners' yoga tutorial on YouTube. 10 a.m. \u2014 Finished working out and checking emails. Breakfast is a bagel with lactose-free cream cheese and it hits the spot. Time to do homework until class. 12:10 p.m. \u2014 Late to my noon class ... on the first day. Thankfully, the professor is nice and lets me slide in unnoticed. 2 p.m. \u2014 Time for lunch! That two-hour class was awful and I am starving. After talking myself out of coffee, I find a spot in the library to eat and do homework. Lunch today is a quinoa bowl with chia seeds, broccoli, peas, arugula, spinach, and chickpeas. 5:30 p.m. \u2014 After being at work all afternoon, I cannot wait to eat dinner, which my roommate informed me she is making. I recently moved and love my new roommates \u2014 and the fact that they cook is big reason why. I am even more excited once I find out that she is making soup. Advertisement 10 p.m. \u2014 The only downside of moving in the middle of the school year is that I'm a subletter. The person whose spot I took owned all the furniture in our apartment, so my new roommates and I are shopping for what we need today. My contribution was an insanely cheap coffee table, but once it is set up in our living room, it actually looks great and I am really happy with the purchase.  $20.86 12 a.m. \u2014 It's bedtime and I am stoked.

I do a quick morning routine and make breakfast. Another bagel with cream cheese, and grapes and coffee for the road. 9:10 a.m. \u2014 Get to campus and text a friend to save me a spot. I still have plenty of time but I want to get a good spot since it is a full class. 10:40 a.m. \u2014 Class is over and I am drained. I did not get enough sleep last night (or this week) and I am really feeling it. I buy a pick-me-up Diet Coke with vanilla, glad I have something to sip while I do homework. On the way back to my car I see a ton of people I haven't seen since before winter break. We do a whole bunch of quick \"hellos\" and I'm reminded me how loved I feel in this city, even though I am far from home.  $2.61 Advertisement 1 p.m. \u2014 Break from homework for lunch: an omelet with a variety of veggies and toast, and veggies and hummus on the side.

Thank god for Prime and free shipping.  $6.54 3 p.m. \u2014 I stop and get gas on my way to work. I still have about a quarter tank but the price is good.

I had to be stern with them for the first time and I hated it. I'm in a sour mood but am seeing my best friend today to go shopping. Retail therapy, here I come. 8 p.m. \u2014 After two hours at the mall fueled by free bagels from work, we walk out happy. I picked up two pieces of lingerie: a bold, red lacy bralette and a beautiful periwinkle teddy. I am obsessed with them, despite how expensive the purchase was. It also works out that my consistent hookup and I are meeting tonight for the first time this semester.  $57.27 11:30 p.m. \u2014 I have officially blocked my hookup. He isn't great about making plans and has canceled twice in a row and I refuse to put up with that anymore. Being a millennial who is not ready to date, but is also looking for someone consistent, is really hard. I'm glad I never see this guy unless we make plans, although I will miss him. I am also PMSing so I spend the rest of my Thursday crying about a boy I never even had feelings for. Gotta love college. I told all my roommates he was coming over so now I have to do a different walk of shame to the bathroom to take off my makeup; that's probably the worst part \u2014 not to mention that I skipped dinner to avoid being too full for a hookup that didn't happen.

I made a promise to never drink on any empty stomach after some bad freshman year experiences. I eat a cheese quesadilla with my favorite Whole Foods salsa. It's not a lot, but I get the drunchies really bad and want to eat healthier while I'm thinking about it. 9 p.m. \u2014 We decide to go to a trashy college bar that won't break the bank. I'm still bummed about being turned down last night and plan on looking hot tonight \u2014 with the help of my roommate's more scandalous wardrobe. 2 a.m. \u2014 The night was a fail. The bar didn't work out, the party got busted, and we had to pee so we just went home. My roommates and a friend continue drinking while catching up on  The Bachelor  and that's more than okay with me at this point.

My roommate's BF has a friend in town this weekend and due to the crazy cold temps recently, a lake near us has frozen and we are going hiking up to it this afternoon. When I was home in Minnesota for Christmas, it was far too cold to hang out outside so I'm excited for the trip. I make plans to do laundry with a friend and start hydrating.

I love hiking and wish I did it more often, especially since I have thousands of miles of trail in my backyard. 5:30 p.m. \u2014 We are all hungry and decide on a fun burger place located between the hiking spot and where we live. The service is slow, but the food and company make the trip worth it. I gave up meat in August and order my first falafel burger ($8). I'm in love. My roommate and I split seasoned fries and we all try $1 beers.

She calls an Uber and we take our final shots, shotguns, and drinks. We are ready! The party is being hosted in a house with brothers from one frat but it's not a frat party, so there's an excellent mix of people and a really good guy-to-girl ratio. My friend A. is nervous he won't get in, but my roommate and I know he won't have a problem because we know the hosts well.

All of the people I know well are passing around drinks for others to try and I'm tasting a little bit of everything. Since there are more guys now, I stick close to A. The crowd is getting really grabby and I want a safety person. He does a great job making sure I am okay, which I am beyond thankful for. 2:30 a.m. \u2014  My stomach is mad at me after downing a quarter of a bottle of wine with my roommate's boyfriend.

Because I showered the night before, I only need to dry shampoo, wash my face, and put on makeup. I grab oatmeal and raspberries for breakfast and throw together leftover ground turkey and fat-free refried pinto beans in a Pyrex with a pre-packed cup of guac and an applesauce pouch for lunch. Advertisement 6:50 a.m. \u2014 I'm out the door and off to work. I tell myself I don't need to go to Starbucks because there is a coffee machine at work; I need to stick to the budget I made for myself! Work is about 20 minutes away, east of Seattle, and I try to get there early enough to beat traffic. I settle into work, get a coffee, and eat breakfast. 8 a.m. \u2014 The day is still going and I grab another cup of coffee. 9 a.m. \u2014 Need\u2026more\u2026coffee. I usually stick to one cup so this is not normal for me. I am seriously struggling to get back into a work routine. 10:30 a.m. \u2014 My group of gal friends are blowing up my group text about going to Disneyland in March. We finally set on a date and plane tickets. Luckily for me, I got a gift card to Alaska Air for Christmas and can use it toward this trip! The plane ticket is $166.60 and I still have $133.40 to put toward a trip later this year! 12:55 p.m. \u2014 I finally am hungry for lunch. It's boring because the taco/bean/guac combo is my go-to when I'm in a hurry, but it gets boring. I think beans hurt my stomach, so I don't know why I keep putting that pain on myself. I am scheduled to be at work until 5 p.m. rather than my normal 3 p.m. today, so I need to talk a little walk. That turns into me grabbing a small mocha at the caf\u00e9.  $4.95 Advertisement 3:20 p.m. \u2014 My BF texted to say he's going to the gym after work and won't be home for dinner. I text my best friend to see if she wants dinner. We decide on a pasta restaurant at 6 p.m. It's a date! 5:30 p.m. \u2014 My meeting ran half an hour late, so I call the restaurant and my friend to change the time to 6:30. Leaving at this time usually means I'll hit the worst traffic ever, but I think people are still on vacation because I get to the restaurant way earlier than anticipated. I pay to park ($6) and, since I'm early, decide to get a drink at the bar. It's still happy hour! I get the house amaro and it's my first time having it; it's sweet but bitter and smoky. Interesting. For dinner, I order the pappardelle. We split a bruschetta with smoked salmon for an app. NOMS. We split the bill and I pay with Christmas cash \u2014 $45 even.  $51 8:15 p.m. \u2014 Back at home, I wash my face and get into my sweat suit. My apartment is cold and I don't want to spend money on any more heat than we need. I cozy up and dig into more of Anna Faris' life. I should hopefully be done with this book soon! Daily Total: $55.95", "day_four": "Day Four: 5:45 a.m. \u2014 I need to be at work on time because I have to leave promptly at 3 p.m. I grab my oatmeal and raspberries and find more leftover steak from Monday, three mini-cucumbers, a scoop of hummus, and another applesauce pouch. (This one has banana in it!) At work, I head straight to the coffee machine and then to my desk to do more work (and maybe some Instagram and Facebook scrolling). Advertisement 8:15 a.m. \u2014 Last cup of coffee ... maybe. While I wait for my coffee to brew, I realize I need to pay off some of my credit cards. I put $200 to each credit card. I need to get these paid off soon. I cringe every time I look at the balance I owe.  $400 9:45 a.m. \u2014 My oatmeal with raspberries is staring at me. It's time to eat. 1:15 p.m. \u2014 I have my lunch. The steak is actually pretty good and not too dried out from the microwave which is a win in my book! 3 p.m. \u2014 I leave work for a dermatologist appointment. I have a $15 copay and luckily don't need any meds or anything else. I go home after and veg out, watching TV until dinner (the baked potato I bought from Met Market on Monday). It was alright but I might be hungry later.  $15 7 p.m. \u2014 I take a shower because tomorrow is Friday and I know I will probably sleep in. After, I do some scrolling on Instagram and get back to Anna Faris. My boyfriend returns from a workout and I internally shame myself for not doing the same. (Maybe I'll go TOMORROW! Or Saturday. Or Sunday?) Anyway, time for bed. We go to bed super early, around 9 or 9:30 p.m. Daily Total: $415", "day_five": "Day Five: 6:15 a.m. \u2014 My alarm didn't go off. Awesome. I jump out of bed and get ready. My morning routine with hair styling and no shower is almost down to 15 minutes. I pat myself on the back for showering the night before and declare dry shampooing a big win. I get to work at a decent time and realize I have a free coffee on my punch card for the caf\u00e9 at work! I opt for a large Americano with one pump of white mocha and cream. I didn't pack anything this morning for breakfast or lunch, so I also get a scone.  $2.75 Advertisement 11:45 a.m. \u2014 Hungry, I go to our common area to get lunch. I need to get away from my desk. It's been  very  slow this entire week. (I'm complaining even though I've only been in the office for three days.) There are so many changes happening in our organization so it's been a waiting game these day. Our common area has everything from pizza to burgers, sushi, ramen, buffet food. The world is our oyster! (IDK if they have oysters though.) I'm in the mood for sushi so I get a combo with an eel roll, salmon nigiri, and a cup of edamame. Luckily, the line is short today. I get my food quick and find a spot to sit and scroll online until I go back to my desk to work until my day is done.  $12.50 3 p.m. \u2014 I leave work at normal time and head over to Bellevue for happy hour with my boyfriend's flag football team to celebrate the end of their season. I filled in a few games so I'm invited. His company is paying for the happy hour! I'm a little early to the party. The happy hour is connected to the Bellevue Square Mall, so I decide to do some window shopping. I repeat in my head,  Look but don't touch. Look but don't touch ... Fortunately, I follow my silent commands. I get to happy hour and order a Moscow Mule and pretzel. The rest of the table orders beers, nachos, fried pickles, and chicken wraps. Advertisement 8:15 p.m. \u2014 The happy hour is over and I go to the store. In anticipation of my Keurig, I get creamer, K-cups, and breakfast stuff ($26.92). After that, I go to Molly Moon's; their January flavors are out so I get a pint for the week ($9.50). Delicious.  $36.42 9 p.m. \u2014 Back at the apartment and my Keurig is here! I set it up and then get a scoop of ice cream and settle in for the rest of the night. Daily Total: $51.67", "day_six": "Day Six: 8:45 a.m. \u2014 Wow, I really slept in. I have nowhere to be so I lay in bed for a bit. It's a rainy day here in Seattle and also a perfect time to use my new Keurig. I go for the Donut Shop brand K-cup and add vanilla-caramel creamer. I'm pretty happy. I go online and work for about an hour because I wasn't very productive this week and I forgot to do something important. Oops. 10:45 a.m. \u2014 While thinking about my upcoming trip to Disneyland, I notice we'll have to take a shuttle from LAX to Anaheim. I look up shuttles and book the cheapest one for our group at $172 roundtrip. Since people will pay me back, that will be $34.40 out of pocket per person \u2014 not too shabby.  $34.40 11:30 a.m. \u2014 I go get ready for the day because my boyfriend's parents and brother are in town. His brother is going back to school so we all meet up for a going-away lunch at Duke's Chowder House. I order the blackened salmon Caesar with an iced tea. We say our goodbyes and go back to the apartment. Advertisement 3:30 p.m. \u2014 For Christmas, my boyfriend got me a punch card to go rock climbing, so we go get our climb on. It's been a little over a month since I've last climbed and I am rusty. I am not an avid climber and stick to the 5.7s the whole time. I am not great with holds \u2014 and not nearly as strong as I used to be. I used to be really into weightlifting but I've taken a hiatus for the last seven months or so. I'm noticing a theme, and it's that I need to get back to the gym. 5:15 p.m. \u2014 We finish rock climbing and go back to the apartment to shower. We decide on a BBQ spot for dinner to get food to-go and my boyfriend pays. I get a chicken sandwich and jo jo potatoes. It's Netflix and chill for the rest of the night. Daily Total: $34.40", "day_seven": "Day Seven: 8 a.m. \u2014 I finally get out of bed and make coffee with my new Keurig. Only two days in and it is already a great investment! Some friends are coming over today to watch the Golden Globes and our apartment is a mess, so I do a deep clean. It's much more stressful thinking about it than doing it. 10:45 a.m. \u2014 Finished cleaning! I make myself a breakfast sandwich with bacon and eggs on seven-grain bread, then get ready so we can go to the grocery store. I allot for $50 for my portion but I'm hoping I can just use the cash in my wallet ($46). We split the bill and it's only $15.06. Big win \u2014 not only am I under budget but I have money to spare for pizza tonight!  $15.06 Advertisement 12:05 p.m. \u2014 Back at home, I finish the rest of Anna Faris' book. Finally! My stomach starts to grumble so I eat a snack of apples and peanut butter. 4:15 p.m. \u2014 My friends are here and I order a large pizza and a side of cinnamon sticks. I pay with a coupon deal and tip. Since my friends brought other snacks, we don't split the bill. There is leftover pizza too, so there's lunch for me tomorrow! (And I'm still technically under-budget for my $50 grocery allotment.)  $32.37 5 p.m. \u2014 We sit back with our pizza and cringe at all the awkwardness coming our way for three hours. From Tommy Wiseau to Frances McDormand, everything is straight up confusing. We do, however, get to watch the glorious goddess that is Oprah do her thing. 8:30 p.m. \u2014 My friends leave for the night and I clean up and get ready for bed. I'm exhausted and my throat is feeling scratchy. I better not be getting sick... I get to sleep by 9:30 and all is well in the world.

My calf feels like it's about to seize up into a Charlie horse and I brace for it, but the pain continues with every step I take. I put it to the back of my mind and make myself an egg, turkey sausage, and flatbread sandwich. Said flatbread gets stuck in the toaster and I try to free it for minutes without electrocuting myself. There are crumbs EVERYWHERE. I drink leftover coffee from the fridge, pretending it's cold brew. 9 a.m. \u2014 I walk to and from campus every day. It saves me almost $1,000/year in parking fees and allows me to get steps in. I've lived in two cities on the East Coast and I missed walking. When I moved back to Ohio, I made sure to live close enough to work to walk. Like many Midwestern cities and towns, you can drive and park almost anywhere so you need to make it a priority to walk. Advertisement 1:07 p.m. \u2014 I'm late! Because I'm working alone today, I got engrossed in my work and forget to leave on time to meet my best friend for lunch. I walk to the restaurant but it's permanently closed! She picks me up and we go to another location nearby. I get a CYO poke-style bowl with brown rice, kale, tuna, avocado, carrots, cucumber, pineapple, sesame seed, green onion, spicy mayo, and sweet soy sauce. It's huge but we both inhale our bowls. It's nice seeing her midday and she drops me back at my office.  $12 3:30 p.m. \u2014 My friends are having a white elephant gift exchange next weekend and I'm slowly compiling my gift: a DIY Moscow mule set. I already have the ginger beer and mixers, but my copper mugs arrive too. Another delivery man stops by, and he has the Ancestry DNA kit I ordered for my S.O.'s birthday. It's not until March, but the sale at Christmas was too good to pass up, so I'll stash it away until it's time. He knows little about the ethnic makeup of half of his family and has mentioned wanting to find out. I think it'll be a great 30th birthday present. 6 p.m. \u2014 After I walk home from work, I drop my stuff off, grab my grocery bags, and walk to Kroger. My S.O. has finals this week and requested good old fashioned brain food. I pick up avocados, spinach, sweet potatoes, mushrooms, broccoli, brussels sprouts, a stir fry veggie kit, wheat bread, ground beef, breakfast sausage, whole wheat egg noodles, beef broth, sour cream, two Amy's bowls for my lunches, a box of brownie mix, and Reese's Pieces.  $45.33 Advertisement 7:50 p.m. \u2014 I immediately launch into cooking mode. I make one-pot beef stroganoff with spinach, mix the brownies and bake them, and prep a sausage, egg, and cheese tater tot casserole for my S.O. to eat in the mornings before finals. Growing up, my mom always made hot breakfast during standardized testing weeks, and I feel morally obligated to treat him to the same (even if I'm not home). We eat stroganoff together and watch an episode of  Parks and Rec . 10:30 p.m. \u2014 I clean up the kitchen, ice the brownies and cover them with Reese's, shower, and climb into bed to read a book from the library. (It's kind of depressing and I look forward to finishing it tomorrow.) I say goodnight to my S.O. and leave him to his studies. Daily Total: $57.33", "day_two": "Day Two: 7 a.m. \u2014 I'm tossing and turning from 7 a.m. onward. My nose has been permanently plugged for months on just one side as I sleep. I wish I knew how to make it stop because I obsess over the feeling and lose precious ZZZs over it. I finally get up and my calf is still screaming at me, so I reluctantly cancel my barre class. I got an unlimited month as a Black Friday special and hate to waste it. I make avocado toast with TJ's Everything but the Bagel seasoning and drink more leftover cold coffee. 9 a.m. \u2014 Everyone is back to work today. I get to work and catch up on a few things. I also see that visa procedures for Brazil are changing starting January 25. This is amazing! One visa can cost up to $300 with fees, and this would cost a mere $40 \u2014 a huge savings for students, faculty and staff traveling there. I inform my colleagues and they are similarly thrilled. (Nothing like new immigration rules to rile us up.) Advertisement 1 p.m. \u2014 We go out to one of my favorite breakfast/brunch spots for a coworker's birthday. I order a pumpkin pancake, a side of bacon, and a fountain Diet Dr. Pepper. They accidentally give me a whole order of pancakes so my colleagues happily help finish everything. My indulgent lunch means I only eat a sliver of Reese's Pieces brownies upon my return to the office, but my colleagues dig in to the birthday treat.  $11.38 4 p.m. \u2014 Aww. One of my closest friends from grad school sent me an email with a life update. She lives in Germany, and although English is her second language, her emails are always pure poetry. I'm so happy to see her doing well and I make a mental note to write her back later. 4:30 p.m. \u2014 On the work side of things, my boss pulls me into his office and tells me that I probably need to go to China for an academic program in a few months. It'll be my third time there, and each time I go with a different set of students. I wish I could give other colleagues a chance to go, but alas, this falls under my purview. I'm already starting to get excited; it's a great professional development opportunity and I get to work with students. 5:30 p.m. \u2014 After walking home, I roast brussels sprouts and drizzle them with balsamic vinegar. I find my heating pad, warm it up, and then put my calf on it while I eat a bowl of veggies and finish my book from last night. It's a rather realistic portrayal of divorce, which is probably why I don't love it \u2014 too depressing. Advertisement 6:30 p.m. \u2014 A friend from my D.C. days sends me a text out of the blue and it's amazing to hear from her. I tell her that I'm about to run an errand and that if she'd like, I can call her while I do so. She actually agrees (I didn't want to ruin her free time if she just wanted to relax with wine), and so I quickly grab my coat and get in my freezing cold car. We chat as I drive to Old Navy, and while I intended to go into the store still talking to her, I stay in the warm car with my seat warmers. We make tentative arrangements for me to visit or for her to come to Ohio in the spring. 7:15 p.m. \u2014 It's the last day to use Old Navy cash rewards, so I decide to get my work wife a set of cactus thermal pajamas. Hopefully, she'll love her set as much as I love mine.  $17.72 7:30 p.m. \u2014 I head to the pharmacy next to pick up my ring. There's no charge and I'm in an out within five minutes. I head out to pick up my S.O. from school; they finished class a bit early and it is freezing outside. 8:15 p.m. \u2014 We grab leftover beef stroganoff and spinach from the fridge and eat on the couch while watching more  Parks and Rec . 9:30 p.m. \u2014 I've relaxed too long and need to shower. When I get in, I remember that I have a podiatry appointment tomorrow and I feel incredibly vain even saying this, but these toes of mine need help. I quickly shave my legs, making sure not to miss the spots on my ankles (and feet and toes). I tell myself they'll appreciate the effort, even if my polish is all sorts of chipped.

Daily Total: $29.10", "day_three": "Day Three: 8:15 a.m. \u2014 I get to sleep in even more today. I have more avocado toast and cold coffee for breakfast, and I unload the dishwasher and wash up the knives and pans in the sink. While doing my makeup, I watch a few YouTube videos and finally get dressed in something warm. 9:35 a.m. \u2014 My car is finally warmed through after my 20-minute drive to the doctor, but at least I got to listen to indie holiday radio the whole way there. I don't have to wait long to go back, and one of the residents comes in quickly. Why are all the podiatrists here so good looking? I broke my toe back in July and as of October, it was still broken. I've been avoiding any strenuous workouts and waiting for it to heal, but it's still painful sometimes. We do another X-ray and see that while it has healed (yay!), there's scar tissue that may just be forcing my joint off track. My only fear was making it worse, so now that I know it's healed, I'm free to go back to my cardio classes and work through the pain, which should lessen over time. I'll have a co-pay and a fee for the X-ray, but probably won't see it until next year and I'll use my FSA to cover it. Advertisement 11:15 a.m. \u2014 I clipped Arby's coupons last week knowing that my doctor's office was nearby. I get a sandwich via the drive-through and head home.  $2.82 12:30 p.m. \u2014 I get home, eat my sandwich, warm up my S.O.'s brussels sprouts for him and green beans for myself. It's nice to see him midday but I walk back to work and grab my work wife broccoli cheddar soup in the student cafeteria on the way. We don't keep track of who buys what because we spend way too much time together and that would be obnoxious.  $4 1:15 p.m. \u2014 Another Christmas package arrived! I wanted to get my S.O. something small but useful for Christmas. His Chucks are destroyed; there are holes everywhere and I know he'd like to replace them but can't justify the funds. After I checked his size, I bought a new pair on-sale during Cyber Monday. I'll put them in a box with the NASA socks I always get him. (He's the best kind of nerd.) 4 p.m. \u2014 I've been working on a guidance document and in doing my research, I came across the word \"updation.\" Working with other countries and cultures, you realize that the English language can be adapted in unique ways. I'm pretty sure this is a combination of the words \"update\" and \"validation,\" but Google tells me it may simply mean \"updating,\" though it's not a recognized word in the Oxford dictionary. I need to keep a running list of words like this. Advertisement 5:30 p.m. \u2014 A few coworkers and I meet up for wine and whine after work. I use the brisk, 30-minute walk to call my mom and enjoy a blonde coffee ale with my friends. It's a small group, and it's interesting to hear about their jobs; even though we're in the same department, we all have vastly different roles. We munch on free popcorn and my happy hour beer is $3 before I tip.  $4 7:45 p.m. \u2014 I take a warm shower as soon as I get home before warming up even more beef stroganoff and eating an apple with peanut butter. My boyfriend joins me in the living room and we get sucked into four episodes of  Parks and Rec . I'm watching it for the first time and I need to get ready for bed and dry my hair, but my S.O. is loving the time together and convinces me to stay on the couch with him. He says he loves how much the show makes me laugh, which makes me mushy. 10 p.m. \u2014 I roughly dry my hair and I look like a lion. I usually style it at night too, but I don't tonight and my S.O. delights in the fluffy nature of my hair. I work on a samurai Sudoku in bed before turning out my light for the night. Daily Total: $10.82", "day_four": "Day Four: 7:45 a.m. \u2014 I switch it up this morning and have HOT coffee with my avocado toast. I text with my best friend about a weird dream I had last night (about her ex) and then watch a few YouTube videos (7-Eleven came out with a make-up line?) while doing my makeup and flat ironing my hair. Advertisement 9 a.m. \u2014 I knew it was going to be cold today, so I went for my fluffiest down coat, a scarf, and a hat. As soon as I step outside, I see that it's the first snow of the season; my eyes water the whole way to work from the cold. I should probably switch to waterproof mascara from here on out. 11:10 a.m. \u2014 I can't wait any longer and heat up my lunch of cheddar, noodles, and broccoli \u2014 basic but tasty on a cold day. My coworker tries to give me $5 for lunch yesterday, but I waive it off knowing she's providing my dinner tomorrow night. 11:30 a.m. \u2014 Occasionally, I check the Ohio Division of Unclaimed Funds to see if there's any money for me. I find nothing, but a quick search of my S.O.'s name reveals an amount greater than $100. When I confirm that it is indeed him, he laughs because it's linked to a job he had at 19 years old. Hopefully, it'll be an easy process because that amount will be helpful for him (and really, it would be for anyone at the holidays). I go through some of my other friends and family, but no else comes up in my searches. 3:30 p.m. \u2014 Another package arrives and it's for me! Ulta had crazy Cyber Monday sales and I picked up a NYX brow pencil and setting spray, Eucerin face cream (my face is so dry in this weather), The Body Shop's Ethiopian honey mask (did I mention I'm feeling dry?), Wet n Wild setting powder, and Essence brow gel, mascara, and eyelid primer for under $45. Advertisement 5 p.m. \u2014 I've been uncharacteristically tired all day and I bum a ride home early. I check my temperature when I get back: It's 95.7, but it quickly goes up to normal. I stir fry kale, carrots, brussels sprouts, broccoli, and sugar snap peas with chicken and brown rice, hoping the nutritious food will make me feel better before I'm supposed to take a barre class. There's a fee to cancel, so I'm going no matter what. 7:20 p.m. \u2014 I survived barre! In fact, I felt better there than I did all day. That being said, it was a tad too easy at times, which means I was probably doing it all wrong. 8 p.m. \u2014 I can feel a migraine coming on and it's making me nauseated. I eat a few bites of food in case it's just my blood sugar, take a quick shower, and take my migraine prescription. My boyfriend kindly made up the guest bed (which is my old bed, and I miss how squishy it is sometimes) because he knows I'm feeling pretty yuck. He sets it up so we can watch  Parks and Rec  on his computer from the bed (it's also his office), and I wrap an ice pack around my temple. After two episodes, I'm still feeling awful and decide to close my eyes and hope I'm better in the morning.

We're out of bread, so I eat a bowl of Kashi, make coffee, put dishes in the washer, and do my makeup while watching YouTube. I love my new eyebrow pencil and powder, and I decide to get truly crazy and put on a garnet eyeshadow today. I stop at the grocery store on my way into work because I have half an avocado I need to eat, and I can toast it at the office. I also pick up a lemon seltzer because I usually forget to drink water at all unless it's fizzy. I charge both to a Visa gift card we got for signing our apartment lease. Advertisement 10 a.m. \u2014 Guess who forgot her computer at home? It's been two years since I've done this, and thankfully, I have a lovely S.O. who is still at home today because it's finals week. He kindly brings it in while I eat avocado toast and check email on my phone. 10:30 a.m. \u2014 We have a department-wide meeting concerning hiring and it's a bit illuminating. It also makes me a bit frustrated: I've studied to become an administrator and I worry that people like me will never get jobs that are filled by older academics \u2014 they'll be in an administrative role but I will have had all the experience. I have an Ed.M., and I lament the fact I'll probably have to get a doctorate of some sort, though I refuse to get a Ph.D. 12:40 p.m. \u2014 Hunger strikes again. This time, I brought a new yellow curry with jackfruit, red pepper, and eggplant from Trader Joe's. I've never had jackfruit, and although the texture is cool, this whole dish tastes like pure curry sauce. I love curry but I'll stick to the vegetable panang curry next time. 4:15 p.m. \u2014 I get out a bit early today after doing a task I've been avoiding for weeks. I feel so much lighter! 6 p.m. \u2014 I drive to my coworker's house where we're throwing a craft night, which we do about twice per year. This time, I thought we should make cookie jars that we can give to friends and family for Christmas presents. I brought 24 wide-mouth mason jars and everyone else brought various ingredients for the M&M cookies. We create a little assembly line, eat pizza and buffalo dip, and drink mulled wine. Advertisement 10:45 p.m. \u2014 I get home to an empty apartment, as my S.O. went to see  The Disaster Artist  with a friend. I'm really tired and quickly pass out, fully expecting to be woken in an hour when the movie is over. However, I'm well and truly out (according to my Fitbit the next morning), and I sleep soundly.

I run into a colleague and we catch up quickly before I head into a very busy class. Today's feels much harder but I like the instructor. My calf isn't hurting me at all, which is great. 11:20 a.m. \u2014 I go to CVS, hoping to find Yes To Coconuts micellar water, but they don't have that particular variation. I give up and see that a new Big Lots opened across the street. Big Lots is a weird guilty pleasure for me; they always have such a bizarre mix of things, but it's infinitely more organized than T.J. Maxx or Marshalls. I go in and come out with an Auntie Anne's pretzel making kit, Hostess hot cocoa and marshmallow mini-donuts, and two ICE sparkling waters for the S.O.  $8.45 1 p.m. \u2014 It's officially snowing outside! I get home, eat avocado toast, and decide to do a bit of cleaning. My S.O. usually does most of it but as I mentioned before, he's in finals right now and I'd feel kind of lazy not doing my share. We realize that our dishwasher has officially broken, and after I put in a request to have it fixed, we do the dishes together. I then sweep and mop the floors, clean the oven and stove top, vacuum the living room rug, and use the extensions to clean AC vents and corners that collect dust and cobwebs, as well as do two loads of laundry. Perhaps most disgusting of all, I cut out all my hair from the vacuum bristles. Blech!

It's one of our favorite meals and thankfully takes one pan to make. My S.O. continues studying while I start a new book from the library. Eventually, I convince him to watch a movie with me. I generally dislike movies but he loves them and hasn't seen one of my guilty pleasures,  Pride and Prejudice  (the Keira Knightly version).

He agrees to come along and we bundle up for the short walk to the restaurant. I'm not thrilled will our breakfast joint choice but the others like it. I get eggs, sausage, and a cinnamon-chip pancake that is so painfully sweet I can only eat a third of it. Everyone but me is in school so we spend a lot of time talking about various projects (in three very different fields); the conversation is interesting as always. We all pay separately and walk home on the icy sidewalks.  $12.38 11:30 a.m. \u2014 We both feel like garbage. My teeth ache from the sweetness of breakfast and I'm desperate for salt, so I eat more avocado toast. I settle onto the couch and read my book while my S.O. takes a nap.

I enlist my S.O. to come with me, as I won't be able to carry all the groceries home myself. I get groceries for the week and also pick up ingredients for the three dinner parties we have next weekend \u2014 garlic, apples, mushrooms, avocados, jalape\u00f1os, green chilies, burgers, chicken thighs, chorizo, eggs, cream, whole milk, chocolate milk, a shed load of white American cheese for dip, buns, tortilla chips, broccoli cheddar soup, two frozen meals for work, orzo, chicken broth, flour Oreo pudding mix, cool whip, chocolate cake mix, Oreos, EVOO, green beans, club soda, potato salad, and AA batteries.  $88.81 5 p.m. \u2014 We're hungry early and make Monterey Jack and bacon cheeseburgers on whole wheat buns with steamed broccoli. (S.O. also has potato salad, but I don't do mayo like that.) We finish watching  Pride and Prejudice  and I paint my toes a deep purple-gray; S.O. thinks they look black. 9:30 p.m. \u2014 My S.O. has a bad headache and lies down early. I take a shower, get out my clothes for work tomorrow, and read more of my book. I eventually join him in bed and together we look at the \"aww\" sub-Reddit.

Tuna poke bowls are one of my favorite to-go dinners, but the price adds up after I add seaweed salad and avocado.

I think I circled the block by her place four or five times before giving up and just driving farther away to find a spot. I walk toward what I think is her street, but realize I'm not by her place at all. I give in, call a Lyft, and pick her up so we can go to Neiman Marcus in Union Square. My friend and I both use Rent the Runway Unlimited's subscription service (and RTR is located on the top floor of Neiman). Since I've moved, I have significantly fewer social and work events to go to, so I generally use it for getting nice work clothes or when I travel.  $10 12:30 p.m. \u2014 My friend pays for a Lyft over to the Marina/Wharf area where we are picking up rental bikes. We end up grabbing a late lunch at Buena Vista, the home of the original Irish coffee! We share a table with a couple and end up in conversation. One half of the couple is moving here from Seattle in a few months, and she is in town trying to figure out what neighborhood she wants to live in. We have fun exchanging moving to the Bay Area stories.  $25 Advertisement 2 p.m. \u2014 Bike pickup! Our plan is to ride over the bridge and take the Sausalito ferry back. (Our bike rental includes the ferry fare.) We conquer the last hill before the bridge and think we're in the clear for a nice, non-hilly experience the rest of the way \u2014 wrong. There aren't any hills but it is crazy windy! We make it over the bridge after what seems like the longest, coldest, most difficult ride ever, thankful to leave that behind us. The views are great but it is an experience I'm happy to have completed once and not repeat. We bike down to beautiful Sausalito, which is so charming, and find a little market for coffee to warm up. After, we get to the line for the ferry, and it is so insanely long that we decide to take a cab back. We share the car with another couple visiting from Germany, and my friend covers the cost of the car since she'll get a credit for the ferry tickets, and I covered the Lyft earlier.  $40 6 p.m. \u2014 The car drops us off about a block away from the bike return and we enjoy a last, short ride through the crab-smelling wharf. The return goes great, and I call a Lyft to take us to dinner. My friend is doing a January cleanse \u2014 no alcohol, dairy, or gluten \u2014 and being the good friend that I am, I pick one of my favorite restaurants, Delarosa, which has amazing pizzas and salads. Friend gets mussels and a salad, and we essentially share a table (divided with a small decoration) with two guys visiting on break from college. They are 18, and my friend gives them suggestions for places young'uns can visit. We finish dinner and I pay; my friend pays me her half on Venmo.

Friend agrees, and we decide not to go. A few minutes later, my friend suggests we reconsider so before I know it, we are running downstairs to the yoga studio on the ground floor of her building. The class is  packed . I quickly sign up for a free one-week pass and my friend drops my mat next to a cute shirtless guy.

Each day, I wake up, feed the kitty, and drink coffee while watching TV. Then I do physical therapy exercises (I hurt my back last year, and it led to lots of other problems), get ready, and eat yogurt with homemade granola. I make the granola in huge batches, so it lasts me forever. Unfortunately, I burned the last batch, and I'm kind of regretting my strategy of making a ton at a time. After this, I take the metro to work. 12:30 p.m. \u2014 It's an unusually meeting heavy day, so I eat lunch at my desk. Today is tomatillo poblano pork with citrus rice, pickled red onions, and a vinegar slaw. It's my attempt at a more interesting taco bowl.

I have a few days left on the membership, and one class to use up, so I look for last-minute availability and see a barre class at 5:30. I bounce out of work at exactly 5 to get there in time. The barre class is super fun but REALLY hard. Luckily, the instructors are good at paying attention to my form. The last time I tried barre, it aggravated my back. This time, they used all sorts of cushions for the ab exercises and it was much, much better. I leave, still shaking from how hard it was. On the bright side, I feel incredible. 6:30 p.m. \u2014 I meet my friends a block away from the barre class for our weekly happy hour before our weekly trivia game; this time we go to a pizza joint. Ravenous after barre, I order a fantastic meatball slider, fried calamari, a glass of sangria, and drink about 10 glasses of water. I'm a bit surprised at how expensive this happy hour is, but the food is definitely worth it.  $32.50 8 p.m. \u2014 Trivia starts at 8 and I nurse one cider the whole night because happy hour was pricey. We end trivia solidly in the middle of the pack, which we are all pretty happy with. I want to take a Lyft home, but I decide to save money and take the metro instead. Once I get out from underground, I try to call my boyfriend. He is a freelancer and has been working early-morning call times all week. It's almost 11 at this point, so we literally talk for two minutes before he hits the hay. Even so, I'm thrilled to hear his voice.

Earlier in the week, I brought in a few bags of a new pomegranate, raspberry, and strawberry green tea. Excited, I make a cup and talk about how great it is to both of my coworkers as we wait for a call to start. As hardcore coffee drinkers, they both look confused that someone could be so excited about tea. Nevertheless, we have a very productive call and all leave it in a good mood. 11:30 a.m. \u2014 I'm so hungry I can't wait until the normal time to eat lunch, so I eat more of the tomatillo poblano pork rice bowls. After lunch, I am still starving and try to think of a snack supplement. I see that my favorite dessert food truck is in the area and go with a coworker. She asks me to buy her pie, so I'm guessing money is tight for her. I oblige and buy three slices, one for me, one to take back for my boyfriend (this is also his favorite pie shop), and one for my coworker. After I've already paid, I realize that the food truck guy looks like death (sweating, coughing, mentions he's closing the truck despite a long line), and probably has the flu. Since I'm a super hypochondriac, I decide not to risk eating the pie. However, because my boyfriend is fearless, he happily volunteers to eat both pieces so they won't go to waste.

I go down to the mini-mart in my building to get popcorn. When I get back on the elevator, a sweet elderly gentleman tells me he likes my shoes. I'm sure he's just making conversation, but it's nice to get a compliment. I make a mental note to compliment random folks more often. Half an hour later, I'm  still  hungry. I remember that one of my coworkers (who usually works remotely) keeps Luna bars stocked in her desk for random times like this and makes it known that we are welcome to take one. I take her up on the offer thanking goodness that she is so thoughtful.  $1.67 5 p.m. \u2014 I have time to kill before my book club (which is just me and two friends who have similar taste in books) meets for dinner.

I order a sour cider (holy shit it's good!) and wait for my friends to arrive. I order crab-and-corn hushpuppies to share and a personal pizza for dinner. Since I'm still craving pie, I order the key lime pie for dessert. It's actually the size of a small pie and not a slice, so I take most of it home. Dinner takes an hour longer than I thought due to a very slow waitress, but I still metro home instead of Ubering. When I get there, my boyfriend comes over for the first time this week.

I quickly heat up an Indian food TV dinner from Trader Joe's. Then, I spend the next 15 minutes chasing her around the house. Every time I get her and put her in her cage, she manages to get out of my grip. Once I've finally gotten her in the cage and the car, the cat is not happy and won't stop meowing. Still, kitty and I must have the same taste in men because the second the very attractive vet walks in, she stops meowing and starts hamming it up, rolling around on the examining room table. I, on the other hand, get nervous. A good-looking dude who is good with my cat? Swoon. With my cat behaving, the vet can give me good news: She is totally healthy and her pooping on the floor (why I brought her in) is likely behavioral. She's also lost an impressive amount of weight since I first started fostering her.

By 2:30, the BF comes over and brings with him a spur-of-the-moment McNuggets meal, which he and I split. We usually don't eat fast food, but I'm glad he got it since the TV dinner was not particularly filling. 3:30 p.m. \u2014 After eating, we rush to the metro to catch the \"Murder Is Her Hobby\" exhibition at the Renwick Gallery; it's basically miniature houses of crime scenes used for police training. When we get there, the line is out the door. We eventually get in, and it's super cool. Unfortunately, as I go to take a picture, I realize I don't have my phone. I momentarily worry that I lost it, but my boyfriend sends a Facebook message to my roommate, who lets me know I left it at home.

To celebrate, all his colleagues are meeting for drinks at a bar. Although I have a friend's birthday event that night, I stop by for a bit to support everyone and say hi. Luckily, I genuinely like all my boyfriend's friends. I get two drinks and split chicken wings with the BF. He pays.

It's a good thing I went to get my phone: the original location, a bar with board games, was way too packed, so she moved the party to a nearby burger place. It's not far but metro is slow and I'm already running late. I take an Uber there ($6.30). At the burger place, I order a sour beer, and what turns out to be a gigantic bowl of fries. (I figured it was a small side.) I also get a piece of cake for the birthday girl because everyone else got her drinks already ($27.60).

It's our tradition to read and then guess how the daters rated each other, and if they'll go out again. Since we missed last week's, we have two this week! As per usual, I nailed my guesses. An hour later, I'm so hungry I feel nauseous. My boyfriend also has no food at his house, so we go out to a diner that just opened.

I buy salad mix, green beans, onions, broccoli, hummus, a piece of cake (I still have a sweet tooth), yogurt, milk, clementines, blueberries, and a few frozen meals. When I get back, I eat a giant salad for dinner and the cake for good measure. I half-ass the meal prep I planned on doing because I'm not in the mood. I marinate a flank steak in a white balsamic vinaigrette, brine pork chops, steam green beans, and pop a few frozen salmon filets into the oven. I decide to finish cooking tomorrow and spend the rest of the night watching TV.  $98.69 Advertisement Daily Total: $124.39", "day_five": "Day Five: 7:25 a.m. \u2014 Normal morning routine and then metro to work. Throughout the morning I snack on orange slices and clementines. 12 p.m. \u2014 At noon, I head across the street to my weekly physical therapy appointment. My physical therapist is around my age, and we wind up chatting the whole session, so it's actually enjoyable. The session is $100, but I put it on the HRA card that work provides. 1:15 p.m. \u2014 When I get back from physical therapy, I quickly eat lunch before my staff meeting. 5:30 p.m. \u2014 Once I get home, I force myself to work out. If I sit on the couch, I'm never getting up again. I do 30 minutes on the elliptical machine in my building while listening to the  Modern Love  podcast. I round out my workout with squats and a few upper-body and ab exercises. After, I cook the meats I marinated yesterday and roast broccoli. For dinner, I eat the broccoli and the leftover salmon. I spend the rest of the evening watching TV and do a meditation session since I'm feeling pretty stressed about work. I briefly chat with my boyfriend before I hit the hay around 11:30.

I have my regular coffee, followed by two pieces of naan and hummus. I also do my PT exercises and hop on metro. A few months ago, my doctor and insurance got into a fight, and now my office is out of network. But since I had difficulty finding a new doctor who seemed decent and was available at reasonable timeframes, I'm sticking with my current practice. My work gives us $3,000 towards medical expenses anyway. I did pick a new primary care doctor because my last one left in the hullabaloo. I'm very pleased with the new doctor. She says things like, \"I want you to feel like you can always reach out,\" and \"I don't like to let things fall through the cracks.\" After the appointment and blood work, I'm told I will get billed later. Advertisement 12 p.m. \u2014 For lunch, I eat flank steak with roasted broccoli and a white bean puree. I made the puree a few weeks ago and was smart enough to freeze a few portions for weeks when I wasn't as into cooking. During lunch, I realize I'm out of cat supplies and place an order on Chewy.com for food, litter, a few cheap cat toys, and a new water fountain (my cat refuses to drink water). I also buy a humidifier on Amazon because my bedroom is so dry, and I wake up incredibly congested every morning. I spend the rest of the day working on a big report and snacking on peppers, blueberries, and clementines.  $126.59 5:45 p.m. \u2014 At home, I eat a pre-made salad from the supermarket for dinner, as well as coconut rice from the freezer. Then, it's time for my therapy session. I see a Canadian therapist via Skype. It was fairly random, but while traveling, my mom started talking to my now therapist and realized she was in school for therapy. My mom had a feeling that we would be a great fit, and it turns out we were. She has helped me through a lot of the health anxiety I developed after I got an undiagnosed tropical illness last year after a trip and hurt my back shortly after. Plus, since she isn't yet licensed and gets paid in Canadian dollars, she's super cheap! (It was so difficult to find an affordable one here since most \"good\" therapists tend not to take insurance.) After my session, I do a quick, 30-minute yoga class because I feel like I haven't moved much today. It wasn't hard but something is better than nothing!  $41.25 Advertisement Daily Total: $167.84", "day_seven": "Day Seven: 7:25 a.m. \u2014 Typical morning routine: coffee, yogurt, and PT. 10 a.m. \u2014 It's the last day of the month, which means it's time to pay my bills. I check my bank account, and my paycheck is $100 higher than usual. I realize the new tax bill must have kicked in. Since the vet mentioned that the cat would need dental work and quoted me $750-$950, I decide to use the extra money for a kitty fund. It's easier for me to keep track of saving for specific things by having separate accounts, and I spend a few minutes looking into the costs of starting a separate savings account at my bank. Since I can get a savings account for free if I have a certain amount in other accounts, I quickly get the account and transfer $200 to start. Then I set up a recurring transfer of $85 a month. 12 p.m. \u2014 I try to meet a friend who works in a nearby office building at least once a week for lunch. Since we both tend to bring our lunches, we found an office building that has a basement with tables and is open to the public. However, my friend is super busy at work today, and she asks if we can reschedule. I eat the same steak/broccoli/beans at my desk and later snack on the same peppers/blueberries, clementines. Since I'm still hungry despite all the snacks, I take one more Luna bar from my coworker's stash. I'm worried this is becoming a habit, so I buy a box of my own Luna bars on Amazon and pledge to also share with the office. Bonus: I realize I can have them delivered to work. No schlepping for me!  $12.97 Advertisement 6 p.m. \u2014 I get home and open my mail. One letter is from the vet with the name of a pheromone spray I can use to try stop the cat from pooping on the rug. I buy the spray on Amazon and pray that it works. I'm beyond tired of picking up poo every day. The other letter is from Chase, confirming that I applied for the Sapphire Reserve. It has an amazing sign-up bonus and I have two international trips planned this year, including one to a close friend's wedding. The card has a $450 annual fee but comes with a $300 travel credit, lounge access, three-times the miles on all the spending, and about $700 worth of travel from the sign-on bonus. I'll probably cancel this card next year, but after doing a lot of research about the card and how applying would impact my credit score, I decided it was worth it. I call to say I did apply and I'm approved on the spot.  $16.85 6:30 p.m. \u2014 I do a yoga and barre combo workout at home, and around 7, my boyfriend comes over for dinner. I reheat the brined pork and serve it with green beans, cranberry sauce I had in the freezer. I'm feeling super achy today, so the boyfriend generously gives me a long massage. Then we watch a few episodes of  Episodes  (yes, that's the name of the show) and head to bed.

I worked last night, so I went to bed around 9 a.m. I fill up my electric kettle and make a cup of tea to drink while I relax before another night of work tonight. My sister texts to let me know that she got the Haim concert tickets we've been eying. They're $61 each, and I'm really excited. I love this band and have been dying to see them live! She pays, and I'll send her a check when it gets closer to the concert. 4:45 p.m. \u2014 I lay in bed drinking tea, watching  Scandal  on Netflix, and eating a few chocolates. I hate waking up and having to get ready for work right away, so I usually wake up a little early so I have time for this! 5:15 p.m. \u2014 I get dressed for work, do my makeup, and pack my lunch. I'm taking leftover slow-cooked sesame chicken and brown rice that I made earlier in the week. I absolutely love my crockpot and am trying to use it more! I pack a yogurt, clementine, and carrots with veggie dip for snacks. I heat up the rest of the chicken and brown rice leftovers to eat now and boil carrots to eat with it. Advertisement 6:15 p.m. \u2014 I say goodbye to my roommate, leave for work, and drive the 20 minutes there. I work in one of Connecticut's bigger (and more dangerous) cities, and there's a lot that it has to offer. I park and hop on the shuttle that will take me to the hospital. I run into three of my coworker friends on the bus, and we catch up on the ride over. 7 p.m. \u2014 My shift starts, and it's a busy one! I have four patients but I soon get a fifth as another person is admitted to the floor. 11:30 p.m. \u2014 I quickly eat a yogurt as I try to start some paperwork, unfortunately without much success due to a few pressing emergencies on my floor. 3 a.m. \u2014 Time to finally start all the paperwork that comes along with my job! I'm starving, so I heat up my leftover chicken and brown rice and eat it at the front desk while charting. My clementine and carrots will unfortunately go uneaten, but I'll just save them to pack another day. 7:45 a.m. \u2014 My shift is finally over, and I'm definitely looking forward to bed! My friend and I wait around for another friend to finish her shift. We chat for a bit and all leave 20 minutes later. We contemplate going out to breakfast before going home, but decide to go another time instead. 8:15 a.m. \u2014 I'm feeling hungry on my drive home, and I tell myself that I deserve a bacon, egg, and cheese after the shift that I had. I stop at a small bagel shop down the street from my apartment and buy a BEC on a plain bagel. I shower, devour the delicious breakfast sandwich, and get ready for bed.  $4.20 Advertisement 9:30 a.m. \u2014 Finally time to sleep!

I have the next two days off, and then I'm working day shifts, so I have to get my body back to sleeping at night. After finally dragging myself out of bed, I browse Pinterest for recipe ideas, eat a bowl of Special K Red Berries, and make a grocery list. 3 p.m. \u2014 I head to Stop & Shop where I stock up on groceries for the week. I buy bananas, string beans, salmon, milk, cheese, yogurt, ingredients for chili, and ingredients to make the ground turkey sweet potato skillet recipe I found on Pinterest. I also grab a bag of mints for my grandpa (he's trying to quit smoking and has been eating mints when he wants a cigarette) and a bag of black licorice for my grandma. I'm visiting my grandparents tomorrow, and they'll appreciate the little surprise. My groceries come to $60.08. I have a dollar scratch-off ticket in my wallet that I decide to cash on my way out of the store, and I get a whole $2! I use the $2 as a credit I can apply to my grocery bill and leave the store feeling bizarrely happy to have cut down on the bill.  $58.08 Advertisement 4 p.m. \u2014 I unpack my groceries, throw a load of laundry in the wash, and head to the gym. I spend over an hour on the elliptical, using the weights, and running on the treadmill. I have always hated running, but I'm trying to get into it this year! Even though I run super slow and tire easily, I'm proud of myself for trying. 5:30 p.m. \u2014 Back at my apartment, my roommate is getting ready for work. She's also a nurse and works nights. Our schedules are usually pretty similar, but this week they're practically opposite so I won't see much of her until the weekend. I clean my bathroom and do another load of laundry before lounging on the couch for a little bit. 6:30 p.m. \u2014 I cook dinner \u2014 balsamic string beans and salmon. It's so delicious (and healthy) that I end up eating it all. 8 p.m. \u2014 I settle on the couch for a night of watching  The Bachelor . My roommate is at work tonight so I'm watching solo. I wasn't a fan of this season in the beginning, but I'm hooked now. Despite being forever single, I'm a hopeless romantic, and I get addicted to this show every time I watch it, as corny as it can be sometimes. 11:45 p.m. \u2014 Bedtime.

They suggest that I visit another day in the next few weeks, and although I'm bummed I won't be seeing them today, I don't want them to worry and agree to reschedule.

When I'm done, I settle on the couch with a giant mug of Irish breakfast tea with a dash of milk in it. I alternate between watching more of  Scandal  and reading a book my mom recommended. I've only read a few chapters so far, so I'm not super invested in it yet. I love reading though, and I try to always have a book going. I usually either read books that my mom, also an avid reader (and a librarian), loans me or that I borrow from the local library. I take a brief break from my lazy morning to clean the kitchen before relaxing once again. 12:45 p.m. \u2014 I eat a clementine and Special K while reading my book and perusing the internet. 1:30 p.m. \u2014 I decide to go see a movie since my plans with my grandparents got cancelled. I see  Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri , which I'm excited about since it got nominated for a lot of Oscars. Since it's so last minute, I end up seeing the movie alone. It feels strange, but I actually really enjoy the experience and consider doing it more often.

I see my three patients, do their assessments, and pass out their medications. 11 a.m. \u2014 I eat a Siggi's yogurt to curb my mid-morning hunger.

The floor is really busy, so I'm trying to help everyone as much as possible, especially since I'm the charge nurse again. I discharge one of my coworker's patients for him. 12:30 p.m. \u2014 I drink a Siggi's drinkable strawberry yogurt to help get me through my 1 p.m. meeting without getting hangry. I attend my meeting (similar to the one I went to yesterday) and collaborate with other hospital coworkers to help coordinate more of our patient discharges.

I usually pack my lunch to save money and to avoid having to spend the time going downstairs to the cafeteria. My coworker's steak and mushroom quesadilla does look tempting though! 3 p.m. \u2014 New patients keep arriving on the floor, and I try to help everyone out as much as possible while keeping my sanity. 8 p.m. \u2014 It's finally time to leave! After finishing up some paperwork, I head home, where my best friend is waiting for me. She lives in Manhattan but has a work event in Connecticut tomorrow, so she's staying with me tonight. She took the train from the city and is waiting for me when I get home. 9 p.m. \u2014 After showering and changing out of my scrubs, I head downtown to a local bar with my best friend and my roommate. The three of us decide to grab drinks and apps. I get a beer and they both get cocktails. We split boneless BBQ wings, Asian calamari, nachos, and the most delicious brussels sprouts I have ever had! We catch up, talk about relationships (we're all single and having no luck in the dating scene), and reminisce about some of our favorite memories.

I stop at a few boutiques on my drive home to look for a birthday present for my roommate, but nothing catches my eye. I decide to swing by the mall, and I stop for gas on the way there.

New York is so cold right now, but thankfully I missed the bulk of the snowstorm while I was away for Christmas. 9 a.m. \u2014 I had to get a new MetroCard so I arrive at work little later than usual. I eat breakfast (a yogurt I found in my fridge) for breakfast. We let friends and their kids stay in our apartment over the holidays, and they left a few groceries and goodies behind. I'm starting a new job at the end of the month, so most of the next two weeks will be focused on handing over assignments, consolidating my past productions and billings, and updating my contacts. I'm nervous and excited! 12 p.m. \u2014 My husband got me a great sweater from Everlane that is a little too short; he's returning it, and I'll getting a different sweater instead. We maintain mostly separate finances, though we do have a joint emergency and holiday checking card and aren't really concerned with who pays for what. It's all love! 1 p.m. \u2014 My boss and I grab ramen for lunch. We've been working together closely for a long time so leaving is hard; he puts lunch on his company card and we bring it back to eat in the office. Advertisement 5 p.m. \u2014 I got a great year-end bonus and use some of it to pay off my credit card. I only have a little bit left from our trip because my card didn't incur a high foreign transaction fee. I pay it off and slightly marvel at my ability to do so, as this wasn't always the case.  $700 8 p.m. \u2014 Home. I take the dog for a walk. My husband makes dinner every night, and we eat at home. I'm just not interested in cooking, but I love to clean up. 10 p.m. \u2014 In an immense amount of pain and slightly terrified of my PT appointment tomorrow morning. I take a bath in CBD salts my husband got me for Christmas, which definitely helps. Then it's off to bed with a book. Daily Total: $700", "day_two": "Day Two: 6:30 a.m. \u2014 Wake up, shower, coffee. I drink a full glass of water while getting ready and decide to order an UberPool to PT since it's so cold. It's very close to my office, so I can walk over after and expense the cost, and I'll have a chance to meditate beforehand. ($13.87 expensed) 9 a.m. \u2014 After an hour of very painful PT, I'm out. I had an abdominal surgery to get rid of cysts on my stomach and intestines several years ago. I also ended up getting pelvic inflammatory disease from a misplaced IUD a few years ago and have developed scar tissues all over my pelvic floor that requires internal physical therapy. I leave sore but in less acute pain.  $150 Advertisement 9:15 a.m. \u2014 Quick treat at Starbucks, where I get a vanilla latte. I put $25 on my Starbucks mobile wallet so I don't blindly hand over my card and become more aware of my spending.  $25 12:30 p.m. \u2014 My husband stops by my office and we grab lunch around the corner. I treat him to ramen and get myself a kale harvest salad. He's a freelancer and does a lot of the day-to-day errands when he's not working \u2014 paying for lunch is the least I can do. I update him on my PT appointment, and he says he'll make dinner in the Instant Pot my parents got him for Christmas.  $24.75 2:45 p.m. \u2014 In an afternoon slump and browsing Amazon. I order a Moleskine notebook for my new job ($12), Benadryl ($8.82), treats for the pup ($14), new socks ($10), and dishwashing soap ($4). I'll have to buy a new laptop, so I'm trying to put myself on an austerity budget, and I refuse to look at any other websites, even though there are a couple of Ganni sweaters I have my eye on.  $48.82 4 p.m. \u2014 Researching new artists, closing productions from my current job, and subtly letting people know I'm leaving. It bums me out a bit, but I snack on leftover cashew brittle we got in a gift basket from a client, along with a Pukka tea. They have the best flavors! 7:45 p.m. \u2014 Meeting our best friends for our weekly dinner - It's always fun, and we catch up on our holidays and eat way too much food. We go home around 9:30, and my husband kindly pays for our share. We take turns picking up each other's tab; it evens out in the end but it feels more special and like a date when we play \"CAN YOU GUESS THE BILL?!\" My hip is in a lot of pain from PT, so my husband helps me walk home with his arm around my waist. Advertisement 9:45 p.m. \u2014 Home and in a bath with Epsom salts as directed by my physical therapist. I have peppermint tea and a piece of dark chocolate in bed, and chat with my husband before I take my sleeping pill. (I've had chronic insomnia since I was in a bad accident as a teenager. This is very low dose and doesn't give me that crazy pill hangover.)

I'm trying not to wash my hair every day and am experimenting with different dry shampoos and ways of parting my hair. It works for now. I'll probably pull my hair back at work. 8:45 a.m. \u2014 At the office and I start going through all the emails that no longer apply to me. Being in this weird dead space of having to be at the office but not being able to work on anything new is draining. I'm purposely going into my new job with as little information as possible on the inner-workings of the company, so that I can be fresh-faced on my first day and not worry about any preconceived ideas. Getting my contacts in order is the main thing on my to-do list, but it seems a little awkward to do in front of my coworkers. I eat a banana I brought from home and start plugging away at handover notes. 1 p.m. \u2014 Head out to stretch my legs and return something at the Apple store where I also start looking at new laptops. A salesman tries to sell me on an iPad Pro with a keyboard, and won't listen when I say I'd like a laptop. I ended up having to walk away mid-sentence and go look at laptops alone, making me feel like a jerk but also proud of myself for being more assertive. I wander over to my favorite Thai place and get tofu red curry with brown rice and veggies for lunch.  $11 Advertisement 6 p.m. \u2014 Leave the office early today so I can take a Gyrotonic Pilates class in the East Village. It's aimed at stretching your back and hips while being really gentle to your body. My husband joins me as he has a back injury. This class is a really lovely way to wind down and do guided stretches that work in conjunction with my physical therapy; it's taught by a very graceful ballerina, which makes  me  feel like a graceful ballerina in turn. 8:30 p.m. \u2014 We eat cheesy polenta with red peppers, roasted veggies (sunchokes, peppers, sweet potatoes, broccoli, leeks, garlic, and carrots), and steak for dinner, and take the dog for a walk. I hand my husband a $10 bill for the groceries and so he'll have cash in his wallet tomorrow.  $10 11:30 p.m. \u2014 Finally in bed after cleaning up the apartment. I pack lunch (leftovers from dinner) and get the pup's food ready for daycare tomorrow. I read the rest of my issue of  The   New Yorker . (My boss gave me a subscription for the holidays.) Daily Total: $21", "day_four": "Day Four: 6 a.m. \u2014 Jolt awake to the sound of my husband's alarm. We cuddle for a minute, and he gets ready while I lounge in bed. After he leaves for the day at 6:30, I take a shower and get ready for work, make coffee, and take the dog to daycare. I stop to get a bowl of oatmeal from a caf\u00e9 and I'm in the office by 8:45.  $4.50 Advertisement 10 a.m. \u2014 I make an appointment with the salon around the corner from my house. I want to look respectable in my new job, and as I normally wear sweatshirts and jeans, I think a new haircut will make me appear more put together. I also make an appointment with our accountant. My husband and I got married last spring, and since he is still on a visa and is freelancing, I'm unsure if it's best to file jointly or separately. 1 p.m. \u2014 I heat up my lunch; my office doesn't have a kitchenette or microwave, so I invested in a mini-crockpot. It doesn't cook anything but is like a small warming oven that is perfect for leftovers, veggies, soups, etc. I run out and grab a seltzer from the bodega down the block, texting my best friend on the way. He is one of the most incredible people I know; caring, talented, funny and inspiring.  $1.29 4:30 p.m. \u2014 Meeting a client for coffee (I get peppermint tea) to tell him I'm leaving...The conversation goes nowhere productive, and I end up mentally exhausted. ($10 expensed) 7:15 p.m. \u2014 Home and in a weird, easily annoyed mood. My husband falls asleep with the pup and I take a bath in CBD salts while finishing my book. We walk to get food around 9 p.m. (I get veggie soup; he gets shrimp fried rice) and watch a few shows on Viceland while we eat.  $24 8 p.m. \u2014 I hop on The Outnet and buy a new pair of black jeans. They're on sale and I have a code for 20% off.  $85 Advertisement 10:45 p.m. \u2014 In bed, exhausted from being in pain and calming myself down from thinking about the new job. Am I ready to leave? Not really. Will I be good at this job? Probably. Do I know what I'm doing? Hell yes I do. Am I excited? A thousand percent. Daily Total: $114.79", "day_five": "Day Five: 8:30 a.m. \u2014 I buy myself a TGIF latte, and then talk to my boss to figure out what needs to happen during my last week. I put feelers out for freelancers who can lend a hand at my current office for a month or so while they search for a new full time team member. No one seems promising except for the folks who are too expensive. Oh well, at least I'm trying!  $4.84 12:15 p.m. \u2014 I eat a yogurt with flax seed granola and chat with another client; she's incredibly happy for me with my new job. I've bonded with my clients, and to have her recognize and appreciate the amount of work I've put in means the world. Working in my field sometimes means you're the first one blamed and the last one thanked but this group is truly special, and I'll miss speaking with them daily. 1 p.m. \u2014 At an appointment with a specialist on pelvic floor dysfunctions. It's an appointment I made almost six months ago with a doctor billed as the best in the country and boy, is she. There was a moment during the exam when I passed out from the pain and broke out into cold sweats, but I left with happy tears in my eyes from pure elation. She broke everything out in plain English and was the first doctor I've gone to that has made me feel relieved and hopeful about getting better. She was encouraging and impressed that I had already begun physical therapy, was livid that my old OB-GYN wouldn't listen and kept telling me I needed to keep my IUD in and to get used to it. I've never looked forward to a follow-up appointment so much.  $40 Advertisement 2:30 p.m. \u2014 I walk back while chatting with my mom; she's just retired after a very successful career but thinks that my new job is going to create too much stress for me. I politely tell her that it's not the stress of the job that is killing me, it's being in constant pain for the past year, having to wait six months to see a specialist, and finding out that insurance doesn't cover basic things like a topical estrogen/pain ointment. I stop and get fresh summer rolls and prepare myself for my prescription that will cost $400 for a two-ounce tube I'll be picking up on Monday.  $8.07 6:30 p.m. \u2014 The afternoon passed without much fuss, and my colleague and I decide to get a drink nearby. I was supposed to be doing Dry January with my husband, but with all these changes happening lately (and never one to drink often anyways), I decided to make it Dry Feb instead. We each get a cocktail, split a plate of fries, and chat for an hour or so. I'm really going to miss working with her. Hopefully, we'll see each other socially more!  $21 8:30 p.m. \u2014 Home, chitchatting with the fam and can't decide on food. In the end, we end up smoking some weed, walking to get a pizza in the rain with the dog, and having a huge giggle fest the whole way. We end up watching silly TV, and I get over-full from pizza and a kale salad and fall into bed around 11 p.m. I read the news on my iPad, flip through  The New Yorker , and play Words with Friends until I drift off.  $25 Advertisement Daily Total: $98.91", "day_six": "Day Six: 9:30 a.m. \u2014 Awake tidying up the house, and I find out we have no milk for coffee. My husband wakes up, and we snuggle the dog, who would sleep tucked in his cozy cave until noon if we let him. We bundle up, take the dog out, get a coffee ($5, including tip), share a mini-bagel ($1.91) and make my husband an appointment for a haircut. We stop at a cute neighborhood clothing shop to check out their end-of-season sale, but I don't see anything screaming my name so we leave, wallets intact.  $6.91 1 p.m. \u2014 Walk a couple of blocks to my hair appointment. I love my haircut (lots of layers that magically make it feel wavy) and the products she uses so much that I buy them ($105 for the cut, $78 for the product, $20 for tip, directly to the stylist on Venmo). On my way home, I stop at the bodega to get milk, seltzer, and a lemon ($8). I have SodaStream but I've forgotten to replace the gas canister for the past three months.  $211 3 p.m. \u2014 Change the bedding and then gather up our tax and green card documents. We have an appointment with an accountant on Monday, and I don't like not being prepared. I spend the afternoon doing agency and contact research, making notes in my new Moleskine, and looking at the new agency website. 8 p.m. \u2014 My husband and I meet our good friends for dinner; we end up sharing a bunch of plates at a cute (also LOUD) restaurant further out in Brooklyn. We walked from our house and are completely frozen when we arrive. They just came back from Cambodia and brought us back amazing gifts. I'm so excited to put up the hammock they gave us this summer. The food was delicious (octopus, ceviche, roasted cauliflower, and more) but catching up was the best. We split evenly; my husband and I put it on our joint card. It's a late one, and we end up sharing their cab part of the way home. I don't have any cash to contribute to the ride but we'll get the next one!  $120 Advertisement Daily Total: $337.91", "day_seven": "Day Seven: 9 a.m. \u2014 Wake up after a fitful night of sleep. I took my normal sleeping tablet but I was up every few hours in pain; it seems like all I do is complain about it, but it's so intense that it's honestly consuming me. Our best friends ask if we'd like to have brunch at noon so we get ready, take the dog for a walk and run him in the park, drop him off, and head over to a restaurant we've never been to. It turns out to be delicious; I get almond toast with a latte and share the salad that comes with my husband's burger.  My husband ran an errand for me, and I didn't pay him back yet, so this is my treat.  $51 2 p.m. \u2014 Home and tidying up. Sorting out clothes to give away to our friend who does a lot of homeless outreach. I bought myself a new parka for the holidays and make sure my old one is in good shape and clean to give away. I noticed doing this diary that I tidy up a lot; I guess that is just what happens when you have a big dog who loves to play in the dirt and throw his toys everywhere living in an NYC apartment. 3 p.m. \u2014 We booked a cleaner from Handy to tackle the hardcore cleaning. We don't normally do this, but the guests that stayed in our apartment over New Years have two little kids that left the floor really sticky... The cleaner is the nicest guy. The apartment looks cleaner than I've seen it in years and I'm so pleased with the result. The guests gave us $100 for a cleaner, and I pay him $20 for tip.  $20 Advertisement 4:30 p.m. \u2014 While the cleaner is around, we take the dog out to run errands but nowhere has anything we need, so we stop at Whole Foods. Yes, we have the dog with us. We've never done it before, but everyone was surprisingly cool with it. He is registered as an emotional-support dog, is wearing a coat, and stays in a heel by my husband's side the whole time. We decided to make a ragout in the Instant Pot, watch a movie, and have a cozy day. We buy meat, veggies, and pasta for it, along with other pantry staples and vitamins for the upcoming week ($36). Our friends come over around 7 with a bottle of wine for the sauce, and our dogs play in the middle of the floor while we chat and decide which movie to watch. My father bought my husband a ridiculously big TV with surround sound for our living room. We go with  Baby Driver  ($5.99), and it is excellent.  $41.99 1 a.m. \u2014 Our friends leave and my husband takes the pup out while I clean up from dinner. Tomorrow's Monday, but it's a holiday so I can afford to stay up later than normal. Thank god for a lay-in.

I wake up my boyfriend, and he hops right out of bed, lets the dogs out, and starts getting ready for work. I check my phone quickly and get out of bed, too. I work in a very relaxed office, and I spend a good amount of time outside. This week, I am in the office, so I feed the dogs while I pack my lunch and make a smoothie for breakfast. I am out the door around 7:45 with the dogs in tow. Like I said, it's a very relaxed office so the pups tag along. 8:15 a.m. \u2014 Get to work. I settle in, start drinking my smoothie, check my emails, submit my time card from the week before, and look at my W-2 forms. The last two years, I have owed over $2,000, so I'm triple-checking to make sure everything is entered correctly. I work two shifts a week as a server at a restaurant and having two incomes always screws me. It's been amazing and terrible at the same time. I currently work on Saturdays and Sundays, so I never have a day off unless I request one \u2014 and I only ever do that when my boyfriend and I have bigger plans. No lazy Sundays in bed for me. 2:30 p.m. \u2014 Eat lunch very late today (leftover tacos, a small salad, and an apple) \u2014 all things I brought from home. Advertisement 5 p.m. \u2014 Leave work to drop the dogs off and go straight to the gym. I eat a yogurt before I head back out. I've been trying to switch up my exercise routine so I don't get bored, but I like to go on Mondays so I start my week off feeling accomplished. 8 p.m. \u2014 Make dinner for myself; my boyfriend had a work event tonight, and he's already fed. I feed the dogs, and he does the dishes. We had friends staying with us for a couple of months, so he makes progress on setting back up our office after the dishes are done. 9 p.m. \u2014 Boyfriend finishes installing updates on our desktop computer and setting everything up. I start updating my r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and LinkedIn profile. Finding jobs in my field is challenging, especially if you can't relocate, but a client shared a job they thought would be perfect for me, and it is! I'm hoping it works out. Although I love the flexibility of my job, I feel like there isn't much room for growth. Because the staff is small, I get stuck doing a lot of lower-level tasks I hoped to avoid by getting a master's. My boyfriend started a new job recently that he loves, so unfortunately, relocating isn't an option right now. (Though I love moving around!) 11:45 p.m. \u2014 Finish up my r\u00e9sum\u00e9 for the night. (I decided to completely redo everything, including the formatting.) I shower and read a little.

I rush around, pack up leftovers for lunch, and make a smoothie. My boyfriend deals with the dogs this morning because I'm so behind. I am out the door in 40 minutes, but while trying to put the dogs in the car (we didn't put their leashes on) one decides to go for a romp in the neighbor's yard. We panic for 10 minutes, trying to get control of her. I never let them off leash outside of fenced-in areas because I'm too paranoid. The one day I decide to give it a go, it fails miserably! At least the puppy jumped right into the car. 8:30 a.m. \u2014 Get to work and luckily, my boss isn't there yet. I have a pretty easy day. I drink my smoothie and make a list of the things I want to get done. I check my bank account because I forgot about a scheduled payment on my LOFT credit card. I bought a dress for my boyfriend's holiday party last month and set up the payment to pay in full on the due date.  $42.73 1 p.m. \u2014 Give in to temptation and get broccoli cheddar soup from Panera and then eat my apple as well. I watch part of the recent  Scandal  episode on Hulu while I eat. My boyfriend pretty much refuses to watch any of my guilty pleasure television shows so I usually save them for the gym and while I eat lunch.  $6.39 Advertisement 3 p.m. \u2014 The restaurant just called, begging me to work tonight. I normally only work on Saturdays and Sundays but a coworker has the flu. I'll have to rush out of here to drop the dogs off home and get back to the restaurant. I'll be a little late but beggars (the restaurant) can't be choosers. At least this will help even more with my taxes. After the last two years of being blindsided with taxes (the first year, my company didn't take the correct taxes out, and last year, I picked up my second job), I'm determined to be a little more prepared this year. I have been saving up and planned to leave the restaurant after I paid my taxes this year, but since we decided to go to Hawaii, I'm going to work until we leave to save money so we don't have to pick and choose what we do. 9 p.m. \u2014 Quick, very slow shift; I'm already home. Didn't make much money but it's more than I had at the beginning of the day \u2014 and $43 won't hurt. I inhale a yogurt because I haven't eaten anything except a few French fries since lunch.

I am going to a new dentist today. Advertisement 8:15 a.m. \u2014 Get to work, where I catch up on what happened during the State of the Union. I am very much a liberal and cannot listen to our current president talk; it makes me too angry or sad, depending on the topic. I usually read his speeches or a synopsis the next day because I still want to be informed. 11:15 a.m. \u2014 Ugh, I have five cavities! I go to the dentist every six months, religiously, but I feel like I haven't gotten the best care since I've move here. I decided to go try my boyfriend's dentist and this checkup confirmed that! At the end of the week, I'll have to get three of the cavities filled in; after that, we'll schedule the last two. (One of the cavities wasn't filled right and needs to be redone.) I'm so annoyed! My dental insurance covered this exam but I'll have to use my HSA card to pay for my portion of the fillings. I have a $50 deductible, and then my insurance will pay for 80% of fillings after that. 1:30 p.m. \u2014 I eat lunch (yogurt, a granola bar, and raw cauliflower with dressing). I usually bring leftovers but I didn't cook last night so it's bit of a thrown-together lunch today. 5 p.m. \u2014 Load the pups into the car and head home, eating an apple on the way. My boyfriend may be working late tonight as well. I'm trying to decide if I want to make dinner for myself again or order a pizza after I work out. Currently, pizza is winning. Advertisement 6:30 p.m. \u2014 I sat in traffic forever! I'm doing a DVD workout tonight. I like changing it up but both dogs tend to get in my way or lick my face while I'm moving. I get a check from Victoria's Secret in the mail. I accidentally overpaid my account last month so they sent me the balance ($11.40). My boyfriend gets home shortly after I finish and he wants pizza, too! He pays. 9 p.m. \u2014 Get back to updating my r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and cover letter. Cover letters are the  worst . I absolutely hate writing them and always feel like I am not saying the right thing.

Office days are usually pretty light, but field days can easily be 10 or 12 hours long. So, when we have the opportunity to sleep in a little bit, we usually take it \u2014 and I have very little to do today. I drink my smoothie and check my bank account. I probably do this more than I should, but I never understand people who don't know how much money they have in their accounts. Advertisement 10:30 a.m. \u2014 It's officially February \u2014 I bite the bullet and submit my taxes. I still have to file my city taxes (Ohio has state and city taxes) but those are usually pretty accurate and not altered much by having a second job. I have a separate tax savings account, but although I put the money aside for this very purpose, sending this much money off isn't exactly thrilling.  $1,430 1:30 p.m. \u2014 Eat lunch: BBQ pulled chicken I made last night in the crockpot, yogurt, and raw cauliflower with dressing. 5:15 p.m. \u2014 Drive home.

The dentist's office is right next to Target though. I finally swing by determined to buy things on my list: acne cream (I never had acne in my entire life, but around age 30, I started breaking out occasionally and it's the worst), dry shampoo (I've been using baby powder, which is ... not working out well), and hair ties ($45.33). I also get a Valentine's Day card for my boyfriend and a peanut butter egg because I'm obsessed ($9.70).

It's Friday and I am so looking forward to tonight. Since I normally work late on Saturday nights and during the day on Sundays, Friday nights are the only part of the week that feel like time off to me. I usually try to leave work a bit early and will probably do that today as well. 10:40 a.m. \u2014 Check my bank account. I am getting reimbursed $160 for a claim I made on the dog insurance about two weeks ago. As much as I hate paying for the insurance every month, having them reimburse 90% of the puppies' first-year wellness visit is awesome. I also see that my $95 yearly fee for my Chase Sapphire card went through. I love this card; it has a great points reward system and is amazing when traveling internationally. That being said, my boyfriend has the Sapphire Reserve, which has a much higher yearly fee but much better perks. I transfer all my points to him, and we book travel and redeem points through his account. At this point, I'm not sure if us both having a card with a yearly fee makes sense. This might be my last year I have my card.  $95 1 p.m. \u2014 I eat leftovers for lunch, a yogurt, and carrots with peanut butter. 3 p.m. \u2014 I don't have much left to do so I screw around online, trying to stay motivated and finish the last thing I need to do today. I have tracked all of my debt since I started seriously trying to pay it off about over two years ago, and I spend  far  too much time today envisioning how I'll pay off of the last $6,000 (mostly student loans). It mostly involves fantasies of an SUV and not working a second job. Advertisement 5 p.m. \u2014 Do a quick HIIT workout. My boyfriend and I are going out to dinner tonight, and I need to shower and get ready. 7 p.m. \u2014 We have a $25 gift card, but it doesn't go far at this restaurant. I order one drink, he orders two, and we both get an entree.  $85.14 10:30 p.m. \u2014 We were supposed to book hotels for our trip to Hawaii, but I fell asleep on the couch.

I go to the gym after I eat breakfast. 11:30 a.m. \u2014 Boyfriend meets me at the grocery store and we shop for the week. We get lots of fruits and veggies, unsweetened almond milk, he gets lunch meat for himself, we both get yogurt and granola bars, and other items. I pay since he paid last week.  $70.14 4 p.m. \u2014 I'm closing the restaurant tonight, and I hope it will be busy. I spent too much money yesterday! 11:45 p.m. \u2014 Get home from the restaurant.

(We are staying a few different places so it took awhile to sort everything out.) My boyfriend paid about $500, but I paid for and reserved our rental car about a month ago, which evens us out. The total for our trip without airline vouchers and points would have been over $6,000; we only paid $1,500!  $117.68 11 p.m. \u2014 I deposited my restaurant cash at an ATM when I picked up the pizza, so I throw that on my credit card before bed. Despite my expensive week, our planning and saving has meant that my credit card, checking, and savings account barely saw a hit. Nights like this remind me why working at the restaurant a couple of days a week is worth it. It was a long weekend and my \"real\" work week is about to start.

I decide to pay rent tomorrow, on the first of the month. I make a cup of tea, brush my teeth, kiss my boyfriend goodbye as he leaves for work, and do my usual routine of catching up on news and eating breakfast, getting dressed, and doing my makeup. 7:40 a.m. \u2014 I am lucky that Denver has a free bus that takes you from one side of downtown to the other. Public transportation is awesome but free public transportation is even better! 12:30 p.m. \u2014 Lunch time. I try to take my lunches as late as I can or else I'll need a snack around 3. Lunch today is a leftover turkey and pepper burrito bowl from dinner last night. It's actually pretty tasty as leftovers, and satisfying. 5:30 p.m. \u2014 I usually leave the office around 5, and it's 5:30 by the time I get home. I'm already hungry! Decide to skip the gym today because I really pushed myself climbing the night before. Boyfriend comes home around 6 o'clock, and we start making dinner: whole-wheat pasta with mushrooms and a salad. That's essentially all we have in the fridge and we decide to go grocery shopping after we eat. 7:45 p.m. \u2014 Grocery shopping wasn't as bad as I expected, and we even bought a few items that are not on our usual shopping list. This time we picked up chicken thighs, chicken breasts, a whole chicken, lunch meat, a bunch of veggies (zucchini, mushrooms, kale, green beans, yams, onions, garlic, avocados, tomatoes, cucumbers, peppers) almond milk, orange juice, granola, beans, rice, and a few snacks for a Super Bowl party we are having this weekend! We shop at Sprouts, which has amazing deals on produce and great organic snacks. I know we are going to have to buy a few other things for our Super Bowl party this weekend but I'm totally ready for that. I put the groceries on my credit card and my boyfriend will send me money and split the bill with me.  $77 Advertisement 8:30 p.m. \u2014 We get home after a stressful trip to Walgreens, where my boyfriend had to deal with insurance issues when getting his medicine. We end up ranting to each other about single-payer healthcare and how the U.S.  needs  to move towards it. We munch on grapes while putting away the groceries, and later watch Food Network in bed. 9:30 p.m. \u2014 My boyfriend convinces me to buy climbing shoes. I started climbing with him earlier this month, and I've gone three times so far. I enjoy it, even though I am terrible. I also found out that I have a small fear of heights, but I'm slowly getting over it and learning to trust the mat when I fall off the wall. We do bouldering at the gym and it's a great way to spend time together. He pushes me to try things that are out of my comfort zone and I love him for that. I order the shoes online and after shipping and tax, they come out to $51.61. Not bad for my first pair of climbing shoes.  $51.61 Daily Total: $128.61", "day_two": "Day Two: 5:50 a.m. \u2014 This is the time my boyfriend's alarm usually goes off, but he decides to drive to work instead of taking the bus today. (He works in Boulder.) He sleeps in and we have quality cuddle time. 7:10 a.m. \u2014 I finally wake up. My bosses are out this morning so I let myself come into work late. Usually that means going to the gym in our apartment in the morning, but I would rather work out in the evening today. I eat granola with almond milk, drink my tea, and watch the  Today  show while getting ready. My lunch is already packed for today (leftover pasta), and I put grapes in a Tupperware. Head out at 8 a.m.! Advertisement 11 a.m. \u2014 I remember that I need to pay rent today and log in to pay online \u2014 so easy. It is much cheaper to live with three people, but my boyfriend and I are definitely ready to move into our own place. Our lease ends in August and I've been daydreaming and browsing available houses online. We like our apartment, but want backyard space at our next place. 11:30 a.m. \u2014 Make myself green tea that I have at my desk, already feeling ready for lunch. I ate my grapes as a snack earlier in the day. I try to eat healthier five days out of the week and splurge (financially and health-wise) on the weekends. I fill up my water bottle, hoping that my hunger will stay at bay for another hour or so. 12 p.m. \u2014 I check my credit card bill since I am not being very productive at work. I have a really large bill for the month, mostly because I had a few big expenses. My boyfriend had to get an avalanche set for backcountry skiing from REI, and we put it on my REI credit card since I get a ton of cash back from REI purchases. (He paid me $309 earlier in the week, so I'm using that money to pay part of the bill now that it has transferred to my bank.) I also bought my boyfriend an early birthday present: tickets to Pod Save America live. They were $125 each and I got two because I am  definitely  going! Along with a few coffee purchases from last month, it all added up to $777.67. My payment isn't due until later this month, but I would rather be early \u2014 especially since I only get paid once a month.  $777.67 Advertisement 1:10 p.m. \u2014 Heat up my leftover pasta from last night. I usually bring veggies and salad but it's gloomy and cold today and having carbs feels nice. I eat at my desk while catching up on work and watching a Rose McGowan interview. When it is warm out, I like to eat outside, but winters usually mean eating at my desk. Not ideal, but it gives me time to catch up on a few things. 4:45 p.m. \u2014 Just finished over two hours of back-to-back meetings. So much for eating lunch later in the day because I am still hungryyyy. I snack on the small stash of nuts in my desk drawer to make it through the rest of the day. I'd like to leave by 5 but I still have lots of work to do! 5:45 p.m. \u2014 Made it home where a few packages are waiting: one from H&M, and my climbing shoes! I ordered clothes from H&M a while ago and got the cutest apricot striped sweater, an oversized cardigan, a ribbed black sweater, and Chelsea boots. Unfortunately, my climbing shoes are way too small. Bummer. Now I have to figure out how to exchange them for a bigger size. 6:30 p.m. \u2014 My boyfriend gets home from work and we cook a quick dinner of eggplant and chickpea stew in a spiced tomato sauce. We eat that with leftover rice and watch the local news on the couch. Even though my climbing shoes are too small, I really want to go to the climbing gym. We digest and head over there. Advertisement 7:30 p.m. \u2014 I rent a pair of climbing shoes ($6) to try a new problem, and I finish it on my fourth try! I also buy climbing chalk ($2) that will last us forever (and I feel bad because I've been using my boyfriend's a lot). We end up staying at the gym until about 9:15 p.m., working on a few new problems and getting nice and exhausted.  $8 9:45 p.m. \u2014 We get home and while I'm in the shower, I realize how hungry I am.

I know I need a lot of protein to get me through the day today, so I fix up a rice cake with turkey cold cuts and a scrambled egg. I drink tea and eat breakfast while watching the news, and slowly start to get ready for work. The last thing I want to do is change out of my PJs, but I drag myself along. It's \"casual\" Friday at the office, but I still need to wear something other than blue jeans.

It comes with a free drink ticket and we get to hang out at the museum tonight until after hours, which is pretty cool. The museum is also close to my house, so that cuts down on transportation costs! I send her money on Venmo since she bought the tickets on her card. I also remember that my boyfriend paid me for groceries and coffee, so I transfer $47 back to my checking account from the app.  $16.76 10:15 a.m. \u2014 Someone brought a bag of goodies to the office. I snag a piece of pumpkin bread. 10:30 a.m. \u2014 Totally forgot that I scheduled coffee with a coworker to talk about my future and what type of jobs are next in line for me. We walk over to a coffee shop and she ends up paying. She's a really cool lady and we talk about her experiences being a working mom and focusing on your career and your kids. I'm not there yet, but I'm always interested in what's coming up in my life and how I can make the most of it. 1 p.m. \u2014 Lunch time. I am so tempted to go out and grab a big delicious crunchy salad, but I brought leftover eggplant and chickpea stew, so I end up eating that. I also brought tortilla chips for a crunch element (and because we ate all the rice yesterday). It's tasty, but its not exactly what I want, so there might be some snacking later. (I love snacks.) Advertisement 3:35 p.m. \u2014 Stress-eating the rest of the pumpkin bread because of a tight, important deadline that was dropped on me. I tell myself that I can do it and get to work typing as fast as I can. 6 p.m. \u2014 I finally get home and the boyfriend made us dinner! Roast chicken with lemon with garlic potatoes and a salad, all of which is incredibly delicious. (And of course, I eat too much.) I get dressed for the night out at the museum with my friend and watch  New Girl  while I wait for her to let me know she's on her way. The museum is a five-minute walk from my house, so I meet her there. 10 p.m. \u2014 The Museum of Contemporary Art event is amazing, and the weather isn't so bad outside so we drink the beers that come with our tickets at the rooftop bar. After the museum, we walk over to a speakeasy style bar and restaurant for a cocktail. My boyfriend meets up with us there to hangout. I order an incredible cocktail with cognac, smoked black tea, and lemon simple syrup that tastes like magic ($13). We also order a chef-recommended charcuterie board and a very tasty fried pork appetizer. It's nice to chat and feel fancy at an underground bar!

Getting up at 9 a.m. is sleeping in for both of us. I make coffee to bring to the BF to bed, along with a glass of orange juice. I also start making a hash out of the potatoes from yesterday's dinner, eggs, onions, and parsley. We eat, get dressed, and run errands. Today, we need to return my climbing shoes that were too small. I cross my fingers that I find an affordable pair so I can use them today. 11:30 a.m. \u2014 I return the climbing shoes that were too small, but can't find any of the right sizes at the store. I'm a little bummed out, but we end up going to an REI in the same area, where I find shoes that fit great and are surprisingly comfortable (for climbing shoes). They're basically twice as expensive as the ones I had to return, but I'm sick of spending money to rent shoes at the gym and I know these will last me a long time. I use my REI credit card, so eventually I will get 15% cash back.  $86 12 p.m. \u2014 We get to the climbing gym after driving on the busy highway and witnessing two car accidents. Scary! No need to rent shoes this time. Breaking in any new shoe sucks but I tell myself its worth it and try to crush a new problem. No luck, and my boyfriend and I head out to refuel and eat lunch.

It is pretty busy for the lunch hour, but we end up sitting at the bar and having a great time watching the organized chaos of the kitchen. I get three tostadas, one with carnitas and two with chicken. The boyfriend gets a carnitas torta, which I of course have a bite of. I can't finish all my tostadas and give my boyfriend the rest.

After, we go to Target and get paper plates and napkins (not environmentally friendly, but will make our lives easier tomorrow), my BB cream, body lotion, ranch and blue cheese, carrots, celery, canned beans, razors, and Cheez-Its for us to eat while binge-watching TV tonight.

I haven't done yoga in a couple of years so there was definitely a learning curve, but I walk out feeling relaxed, rejuvenated, and physically tired. I feel really lucky that the climbing gym has a ton of options in terms of classes, especially since they are all geared towards making you stronger for climbing. I find my boyfriend downstairs and we leave the gym to go pick up a few more things for the Super Bowl party.

It's Friday but my friend and I have been off from work all week because our firms (big accounting firms) are closed between Christmas and New Year's. Small blessings, but also kind of a bummer for me since I'm a contract employee, meaning this time off is unpaid. My contract started a few weeks ago and it's so far, so good. I drink a hot coffee with collagen, eat a banana, and then my friend picks me up and we go to the class, which we paid for previously on Groupon. It's our first time so we get free gloves and they really take the time to explain things to us.

If there's something that my cousin and I are good at, it's avoiding cleaning. We're not totally horrible though, so after I heat up my leftover curry and she eats a bagel, we go to the grocery store. We stop at the McDonald's drive-through because my cousin wants a coffee, and I pay ($1). We make it to ShopRite and buy the stuff we need to make food for the party later. I decide on croissants wrapped around brie and jam, and I buy seltzer as well. My cousin is making meatballs and a croissant ring stuffed with chicken, sauce, and mozzarella. Yummy situations all around.  $14.16 7 p.m. \u2014 We get home, laze around for a bit, and then start getting ready for the evening. People start coming at around 7 and we eat and drink way too much: prosecco spiked with rose liqueur to start, followed by John Daly's for my cousin and me. We ring in the new year, play a few games of pong and flip cup, and then my cousin and I sneak off to bed at 2.

But after saying my goodbyes, I try to turn on the car and it won't start. Long story short: It's too damn cold and the diesel has gelled. My cousin's boyfriend tries to help me jump-start it in this -8-degree weather (God bless his soul) but nothing is working. We go back inside and eat the McDonald's sandwiches that the girls picked up for us. New year, same us. We try to jump the truck again but nothing happens. Naturally, I'm blocking in everyone else in the driveway, so we have to push the truck to the back as best we can so that the other cars can drive out over the lawn. AAA won't answer us and 2018 is doing me dirty. Advertisement 3:30 p.m. \u2014 I come to terms with the fact that I will not get this truck moved and abandon it. I book a bus ticket for Hartford to NYC and leave the keys with my cousin and her boyfriend before they drop me off at the bus stop. Miserable, I wait on line in the cold for the bus, which is late. I also pull a muscle in my neck during the stress of the day and cannot move my head. I get on the bus and the guy sitting next to me won't get off the phone. I'm over this day so I tell him he's rude and he finally gets off. By some miracle, the bus gets into NYC on time. I take the subway to 175th Street and then the little $2 bus across the bridge.

I definitely have a cold now. But since I've had the past 10 days off, I know I can't pass up on work today. First thing's first, I cancel the kickboxing class that I scheduled for tonight. I have a feeling this neck issue isn't going anywhere for a while. I drink a hot coffee with collagen and half and half while I get ready for work, and make two fried eggs and shovel them into my mouth as I run out the door. I drive my dad's van to work (and he takes a different truck) since mine is still abandoned in Connecticut and walk in a few minutes late. I catch up on emails and get to a few writing assignments. Advertisement 12:45 p.m. \u2014 I bundle up and leave to get lunch. I usually meal prep for the week, but given that I got home at 9 p.m. on New Year's Day, there was no time for that. I go to the salad bar and grab lettuce, kale, broccoli, cucumbers, chicken, feta, and a bean and wheat berry salad. I throw balsamic garlic dressing on it and head back to the office. The rest of the afternoon goes slow since I feel so crappy.  $9.28 5:45 p.m. \u2014 I get home from work and eat turkey soup while catching up on reality TV. I usually like to read after work (my first book of the year is  The Light Between Oceans ) but I'm tired and in too much pain to care.

I had the energy to make pumpkin overnight oats (canned pumpkin, oats, unsweetened vanilla almond milk, honey, chia seeds, cinnamon, and nutmeg) last night before going to bed, so I bring that along with me to work and eat at my desk. I got a Fitbit for Christmas and decide to get my steps in today by taking a few walks around the office. Later, I do some work and then catch up with my cousin. It looks like there's going to be a blizzard tomorrow and my cousin and I are panicking about the truck situation. She has to park her cars in the driveway because there will be a street parking suspension and my truck is still stuck in the way. Not a good day. It's about 25 degrees today and my cousin is going to try and start the truck when she gets home. Prayers up that it moves because if not, I will have to pay to get it towed.

Mmmm. 5 p.m. \u2014 I stop at Trader Joe's to stock up on the essentials I will need. I like to get my cooking oils and shelf items here because they're usually cheaper, while I get my meats and produce at my local grocery store. I pick up ghee, coconut aminos, Turkish honey, yuzu hot sauce (I'm VERY interested in this), Turkish dried figs, New Zealand sweet apple rings (dried apples), kalamata olives in EVOO, canned wild Alaskan pink salmon, nutritional yeast (I literally don't know why I bought this, but I always end up with a few rogue items when I go to TJ's), unsweetened organic pea protein powder, prosciutto slices, riced cauliflower, and a frozen seafood blend.  $67.91 6 p.m. \u2014 After a few days of thinking about it, I decide to buy a membership to the kickboxing place. I know it's a huge expense, but I also know I will really enjoy it and that it'll supplement my home workouts. The manager said the gym would honor the 2017 pricing if I signed up after my second class but I haven't been back since my neck was killing me. I go today to see if they will still honor the pricing (my friend already signed up) and they do! Somehow, I get a great deal for a 60-class package: All told, it works out to just under $9 per class. I hand over my credit card and rip off the Band-Aid, praying that my neck will feel better soon.  $494 Advertisement 7 p.m. \u2014 I get home and there's pulled pork and a red cabbage, red, onion, jalape\u00f1o, and cilantro slaw waiting for me.

The offices are closed because of the \"bomb cyclone\" and I relish in the extra sleep.

I eat oatmeal cooked in unsweetened vanilla almond milk with saut\u00e9ed apples, cinnamon, vanilla extract, and a big scoop of almond butter on top. 2 p.m. \u2014 The weather is so bad outside so there is no leaving the house. I scramble up eggs with Italian sausage and onion and then clean my room. After another half hour of work, I take a shower and ice my neck. 6 p.m. \u2014 I help my brother shovel and clear the snow off the cars outside, even though I am still in pain (maybe not the smartest move) and then have leftover pulled pork with cabbage slaw.

We get free coffee at work and a meal credit for $11/day, which usually covers my breakfast, lunch and sometimes even a snack! The food is surprisingly unhealthy for such a well-respected hospital, but oh well, I can't complain about free food! 2:30 p.m. \u2014 It's a busy day and the hospital is at full capacity lately because of flu and cold season. I've been running around visiting patients and meeting with the medical teams all morning. I grabbed a quick lunch but now it's snack time and I've already used all of my meal credit. Use Apple Pay to buy Boom Chicka Pop. It's SO addicting \u2014 the sweet and spicy flavor is dangerous.  $4.50 Advertisement 5 p.m. \u2014 Finally off work. I've been sitting and charting notes all afternoon and I am sore from sitting so much. (I have sciatica.) I try to take a walk at lunch every day, but on busy days like today, that's just not possible. I take a hospital shuttle across the city (free!) to a location that is closer to my apartment. From here, I walk the last bit home, about 25 minutes. The distance isn't bad, but the walk is straight uphill and then straight downhill, which is challenging to do in my work flats. I usually bring my Nikes to walk home in, but it's Monday and of course I forgot. This routine saves me a lot of money on my commute. Public transportation in SF is not ideal, so I find that taking an Uber to work in the morning and walking home is the best compromise. 6 p.m. \u2014 Make scrambled eggs with salad for dinner (purchased on my Whole Foods run last week).

It's a gorgeous day in San Francisco: Karl the Fog is MIA so a coworker and I sit outside. Vitamin D is just what I needed. We take a quick stroll after finishing lunch. 5 p.m. \u2014 Once I'm off work, I take the shuttle to meet my best friend for happy hour. We meet in NOPA, an up-and-coming neighborhood in SF that is flourishing with new bars, restaurants, and shops. We stop by a bar that has Pliny the Younger (a cult beer that is brewed once a year and requires waiting in long lines to purchase) on tap. Of course, it is already sold out. We leave and go to one of my favorite restaurants, Nopa, for dinner. We both get a drink and split the butter beans, warm marinated olives, and tagliatelle Bolognese. Our tummies are full but our hearts are happy. My friend pays and I Venmo her.  $46 8:30 p.m. \u2014 Uber Pool home after checking out my friend's new apartment. It's so cute!

If I'm feeling extra fancy, I'll use my Chemex, but today, I just used my roommate's drip machine.  $4.40 Advertisement 5 p.m. \u2014 Another busy day! At least it keeps me busy and away from my iPhone. (My Instagram addiction is a real problem.) I packed a change of clothes this morning so I can go straight to my power yoga class after work. I purchased a discounted package last week, so each class is only $12.60. I take the shuttle and walk to my class. This yoga instructor always kicks my butt! I leave feeling rejuvenated and knowing I'll be sore tomorrow. 7:30 p.m. \u2014 On my walk home from yoga, I stop by Mixt for a salad. The line is super long, but I have no food at home. I really need to start grocery shopping more often but it's hard because I always end up wasting so much food. I usually only eat dinner at home two or three days each week and I get free food at work, so it really just ends up being a waste when I buy groceries. Mixt charges a ridiculous amount for their salads, but the toppings are amazing (the roasted squash and kalamata olives!). Plus, it's close to my apartment.  $14.95 9 p.m. \u2014 Do some online shopping. I'm in dire need of work clothes and Everlane just released new work pants. I have a different pair that I live in, so I will give these ones a shot.

I end up arriving right on time.  $6.56 10 p.m. \u2014 We went to a museum, and then had drinks at a bar down the street where we debated about politics for a solid hour. I offer to split the bill but he pays for everything. After two dates, I'm still not sure how I feel about this dude. He checks off all the boxes but I still don't feel any chemistry with him.

When I first started working, I saved almost no money, so in November I created a budget for myself and made a goal to put $10,000 in savings by the end of 2018! It keeps me motivated to not spend as much. Advertisement 7 p.m. \u2014 Home after the gym. I preheat the oven to make more tilapia and broccoli for dinner. While my tilapia bakes, I put chicken in the fridge to defrost for dinner tomorrow and prep overnight oats for tomorrow's breakfast.

I roll out of bed and make coffee and then shower and get ready for the day. 8:30 a.m. \u2014 At my desk I eat the overnight oats, which are surprisingly good. I've got a knot in my stomach, though, because my ex and I work in the same building. He's been traveling most of the month but I know he gets back today so there's a possibility of running into him. We haven't spoken since our coffee and I am hoping to avoid him. Breaking up with someone you love and care for is one thing but then adding in the possibility of running into them every day is a whole new level of emotional torture. I take a deep breath (realize my head cold is better, yay!) and remind myself that there are problems in the world so much larger than mine and that I will be fine.

I have leftover tilapia and broccoli. Inevitably, I see my ex. Try not to make eye contact but feel my face flush bright red. Ughhh. 4 p.m. \u2014 I have a phone interview with my alma mater. They are writing a story on me and I don't feel like I did enough in college for this honor but I'm flattered nonetheless. After, I head home and chat with my roomie and her BF. I snack on a rice cake and strawberries before going to the gym. 7 p.m. \u2014 After the gym, I call my dad and he gives me a quick pep talk. He can make me feel better no matter what. I swing by Trader Joe's on my way home and pick up a few things to make curry for supper. I grab riced cauliflower, bell peppers, butternut squash soup, and red curry sauce. I can't keep away from the snacks so I also grab Joe-Joe's cookies, peanut butter-filled pretzels, and granola bars.  $17.81 9 p.m. \u2014 The curry ends up being delicious.

I got plenty of sleep, but I'm still exhausted because my boyfriend and I have had family in town (including his daughter) for the last week. This morning, I'm dropping off my parents and sister at the airport before I resume my regularly scheduled life. After scrolling through Facebook and Instagram and playing Word With Friends, I finally get out of bed. I bundle up because it is unusually cold outside (29 degrees! In Austin!), and greet my boyfriend and dog. I down a chocolate protein shake with a little cinnamon added in for flavor and then pick up my family from their hotel and drive 20 minutes to the airport. I'll miss them once they're gone, but for now I'm ready for a few days of normalcy post-holidays. 9:45 a.m. \u2014 Traffic wasn't too bad this morning and I make it home at a reasonable hour and start my work day. I work from home, so my schedule is pretty flexible. That said, I have a heavy workload at the moment and I'm motivated to wrap up some of my current projects before new ones are added. Not to mention that reaching project milestones means more monthly bonuses for me and getting closer to my goal of becoming debt-free by the end of the year. (I'm using Dave Ramsey's debt snowball method.) One things I love about my job is that I have uncapped earning potential. With my current workload, at a minimum, I will earn $95,000 in total comp for the year, but I expect that it will be more based on last year's numbers. Advertisement 12 p.m. \u2014 My boyfriend and I need to make a grocery run so that I can make chili for dinner tonight. Ideally, this would have already been prepared in time for today's lunch, but I didn't have time to shop while the family was in town. I buy gas at Circle K on the way there. I can't believe it's gone up almost $0.20/gallon in one week!  $20.06 12:30 p.m. \u2014 We head to Target where we pick up two bell peppers, two cans of black beans, eggs, almond milk, and sparkling water. This will only hold us over for a day or so, but the longer shopping trip will have to wait. We stop at the Starbucks in the shopping plaza (the one at Target is always understaffed with a huge line), and I pick up the trenta unsweetened black iced tea that I've ordered on my app. It's usually $3.19 but I pay with a gift card my friend gave me for Christmas.  $16.51 1:30 p.m. \u2014 Back home, I bake some of the chicken tenders that we bought for my boyfriend's daughter in the toaster oven. While they are cooking, I buy a pair of black Vince Camuto booties that I've had my eye on and two pairs of fleece-lined tights from Nordstrom online. I might have to go to NYC on a business trip at the end of the month, and my old black boots finally died after a recent trip to London.  $162.27 5 p.m. \u2014 I call it a day and head to the kitchen to eat a bowl of the chili that I put on to simmer after lunch. I somehow forgot to buy half of the ingredients that I needed, but it tastes good anyway. My boyfriend and I decide to stay in and watch Netflix tonight. I play games on my iPad, and we go to bed around 9:30. Advertisement Daily Total: $198.84", "day_two": "Day Two: 7:30 a.m. \u2014 Slept in late again! I must have been seriously wiped from last week. I get out of bed, throw on comfy pajamas, and down a protein shake. I forgot to add cinnamon, so it's pretty gross. I crack open the new bottle of mineral oil that I ordered last week from Williams Sonoma, and apply it to my wooden cutting board. It makes an immediate and noticeable difference in the appearance and texture of the wood. I leave it on the counter to soak in and plan to add another coat later. I head to my home office to begin the work day. 11 a.m. \u2013 I get confirmation that our managing partner does, in fact, want me to come to the NYC office at the end of the month, so I book my flight and hotel. Delta has a convenient direct flight to JFK for less than $300, so I book that and pay a premium for preferred aisle seats. I log in to my boyfriend's Starwood Preferred Guest account (he has platinum status and gets better rates) to book my hotel. I find a great deal on a hotel ($440.51) that's just a short walk from my office, and book it.

For now, I forgo my usual phone scroll and hop out of bed to get dressed right away. My boyfriend (who also works from home) and I are planning to check out the H-E-B near our apartment this morning to determine if it will fit our grocery  needs. We just moved to Austin a couple of weeks ago and have yet to find our go-to grocery store. I down my protein shake, drink a glass of water, and make myself a mug of tea before working on a request that my boss sent me late last night. I finish up those emails and we head out to the store. 9 a.m. \u2014 Oh man, I'm starving! In the car on the way back from the store, I eat pepperoni slices that we bought at the deli and drink a bottle of unsweetened iced tea. The store was kind of a bust (we only eat organic and they didn't have a great selection) so we left with just a few staple items: black and cannellini beans, canned tomatoes, baby carrots, bell peppers, avocados, chipotle hummus, baby spinach, deli meats, chicken stock, pistachios, a rotisserie chicken, and my iced tea. The search for the perfect store continues.  $98.44 Advertisement 11 a.m. \u2014 Scrounge around in the kitchen for lunch; end up eating a bowl of rotisserie chicken and baby carrots. 5 p.m. \u2014 Another very busy day at work. Everything that was pushed out for the holidays is coming back to haunt me. I spent three hours finishing up a report to send to one of our clients, made some calls, and call it a day promptly at 4. My company does early release every Friday, which is one of my favorite perks. We ate the last of the chili yesterday, so tonight I make beef stir fry with broccoli, bell peppers, and onions. I buy all of our beef from Crowd Cow (super cool online company that lets you buy \"shares\" of a cow from a local farm), and one order usually lasts the better part of a month. In late December, I placed a huge order for steaks, a roast for Christmas, stew meat, stir fry pieces, and 14 pounds of ground beef that we're still working our way through.

There will be 20-plus dogs of the same breed for her to run around and play with. I'm curious to see if a lot of her behaviors are breed traits that will be mirrored in the other dogs. I quickly get dressed, down a protein shake and a few slices of bacon that my boyfriend prepared, and get ready to head out. The meet-up is at a dog park on the far side of town so we leave a little early to give ourselves time to get lost. We pull into a Starbucks drive-through on the way for an order of egg white sous vide bites and a trenta unsweetened iced green tea. My remaining gift card balance won't cover the $8.55 needed to pay for this order, so I load $30 onto my card.  $30 Advertisement 11 a.m. \u2014 The meet-up was so fun! There were a ton of Vizlas, and it was so cool to watch them all run around together. Our dog passes out as soon as we get into the car, and we drive straight home. I eat a bowl of rotisserie chicken and carrots for lunch. 4 p.m. \u2014 We met with two dog sitters from Rover today, and found a great sitter for when we're away visiting family next month. I book the stay on our drive home, and Rover immediately bills it to my card.  $160.50 6 p.m. \u2014 Dinner was fun to prepare tonight as it was my first time using the spiralizer that my boyfriend got me for Christmas.

I get home and heat up leftovers for lunch.

We just received our cards in the mail this week, and today we've decided to test them out for the first time. We go to the Cinemark by our house to see the latest  Star Wars  movie. 4 p.m. \u2014 The movie is a lot of fun! We decide to pop into Sam's Club afterward to see if it makes sense for us to buy a membership. The main benefit would be the discount on gas that we'd receive as members, since my boyfriend's car requires premium fuel. We explore for 30 minutes and decide to do it. 6 p.m. \u2014 I make dinner (lentil pasta with a beef and veggie sauce), and we watch TV for a few hours before bed.

Work continues to be pretty busy. This morning, I focus on finally clearing out my inbox post-holiday, and take a couple of calls. 11 a.m. \u2014 Lunch time rolls around, and I remember that I was planning another experiment for lunch and dinner today. I am attempting to make pasta e fagioli soup with lentil pasta but what comes out definitely isn't soup. It smells and tastes pretty good, though. I suppose I'm going to strike out sometimes when trying new recipes. Gotta keep at it to diversify our menu.

We're kind of regretting that decision, so my boyfriend checks his Starwood Preferred Guest points balance and we have just enough to stay in Napa for two nights for free, so we book it. We each buy a $75 ticket for the release party for Silver Oak 2013 Napa Cabernet and call it our Valentine's gifts to each other. We also have a membership to one of the wineries up there that includes a free tasting whenever we visit, so it should be a pretty budget-friendly trip.  $75 4 p.m. \u2014 I have a craving for Starbucks and I convince my boyfriend to go with me.

I feed him, pack my lunch, and head out. 7:30 a.m. \u2014 This morning's workout is an amazing class a coworker introduced me to recently: It's a mixture of cardio, weights, and hip-hop. Is there any better way to start your day than with a little twerking? I pay for this class out of pocket because it isn't on ClassPass. I shower and get ready at the studio before leaving for work.  $32 9:20 a.m. \u2014 Once again, I give in to the temptation of grabbing breakfast downstairs at work and get a bagel and coffee. I'm already getting bombarded with calls before I even make it upstairs.  $5.66 Advertisement 11 a.m. \u2014 This morning is hectic but in a good way. I am close to closing a placement that would be huge for me \u2014 if it goes through, my commission would be about $10,000. My candidate's and the client's feedback are really good, and I cross my fingers that we'll make it through the salary negotiation stage without any major problems. 2 p.m. \u2014 I'm out of cigarettes so I reluctantly head to the pharmacy for a new pack. Going through a pack every few weeks instead of every few days is definitely helping my wallet, and I pat myself on the back for the progress I've made. I also grab a lighter, a bag of almonds to snack on at my desk, and two Diet Cokes; the extra one is for my work BFF. Back at the office, I eat lunch from home.  $19.99 6 p.m. \u2014 Time to say goodbye to the second person leaving my team! I try to keep an open dialogue with my team about their career goals, even when it doesn't include staying with me forever. Because of that, I was able to place this employee at one of my clients! I try not to tear up when I give her a hug and remind myself that we will continue to speak daily. 7:40 p.m. \u2014 Finally leave the office and go to my nail salon for my semi-regular gel mani ($34) and neck massage ($14). In addition to doing a great job with nails, this salon is my fave because they are always playing a rom-com on TV for their customers \u2013 tonight's is  The Proposal . I leave a $10 tip.  $58 Advertisement 8:50 p.m. \u2014 My absolute favorite pizzeria in the city is across the street from my nail salon, and I grab a slice and Diet Coke after I do my nails. I enjoy having the entire night feel like a treat.  $5.15 10:30 p.m. \u2014 Finally home! I tidy up the apartment, make a smoothie and lunch for tomorrow, and crawl into bed. I pick up  Difficult Women  but only make it a chapter before falling asleep. Daily Total: $120.80", "day_six": "Day Six: 7 a.m. \u2014 Sleeping in feels amazing this morning! I hit snooze a few times but get up quickly when I hear something crash in the kitchen. Kitty was getting impatient for breakfast and knocked a bowl off the counter; luckily, it's not broken! Get ready for the day and head out. 9:45 a.m. \u2014 I resist the bagel temptations this morning and I drink my smoothie at my desk and hunker down for a busy Friday. 11 a.m. \u2014 Take a break from work and browse the Internet a bit. I order a new vape (I dropped mine the other day and it has been leaking slightly since.) I don't want any excuse to not stick with this new lifestyle, so I'd rather pay for a new one ASAP before the leak worsens.  $28 1:30 p.m. \u2014 Eat the last of my tacos and rice for lunch. I also bring a second helping for my work BFF. He was drooling at the smell of it all week, and I generally bring him leftovers at the end of the week instead of throwing away the extra food I make. Cooking for one person is a difficult science when it comes to portioning. Advertisement 3 p.m. \u2014 I spend another few hours interviewing candidates for my team, and I meet someone I love! She has everything I'm looking for and her answers to my questions don't sound overly-rehearsed. I thank the recruiter who found the candidate and start the process of getting internal approvals to hire. 5:30 p.m. \u2014 We've all had a long week here at work. Some of my recruiters come over to hang and chat for the last few minutes of the day, and I let them leave a few minutes early. 6:30 p.m. \u2014 I meet up with a friend for a long overdue dinner and catch-up. We have reservations at a restaurant near Union Square that has a very weird, almost creepy, Victorian vibe. I love it. I order a BLT with avocado and a side salad. I also enjoy two glasses of sauvignon blanc. We have a great time but are both tired from the week and decide to call it a night after dinner. I put the bill on my card, but she Venmos me for her meal on the spot.  $49.97 10:45 p.m. \u2014 I get home and am exhausted, so no reading tonight. Instead, I watch  Parks and Recreation  on Netflix before bed. I've watched the series twice already but can never get enough Ron Swanson in my life. Daily Total: $77.97", "day_seven": "Day Seven: 10:15 a.m. \u2014 I could have slept in longer, but my kitty had other demands. I get up to feed him but then crawl back into my warm bed and grab my book. I have no plans any time soon and enjoy the lazy morning. Advertisement 12 p.m. \u2014 Finally extricate myself from bed and head to the kitchen. I make coffee with almond milk and brainstorm breakfast ideas. I end up combining leftover ground turkey, scrambled eggs, tomatoes, and spinach and throw it in a tortilla for a breakfast taco. I chat with my roommate and then we watch  Broad City . 3 p.m. \u2014 I finally motivate myself to start my laundry. The amount of dirty laundry that has piled up in my closet is actually ridiculous. I do two loads ($10 total) but I'm stuck paying a $1.75 ATM fee at a corner store because I didn't plan ahead to get cash at my bank. The laundromat is a block away so I come back between loads to clean the apartment.  $11.75 6:15 p.m. \u2014 I finally finish my afternoon chores, shower, and get ready for the evening. I head to Manhattan to catch my college basketball team play at Madison Square Garden. I haven't been to a game yet this year but try to come out for a few and show my alumni spirit! I Venmo my friend on the way for my ticket.  $40 7:10 p.m. \u2014 Meet up with two friends for pizza and beer that all the students and alumni have deemed the go-to pregame spot. I grab two slices ($5.90) and a beer for myself and the others ($16.50).  $22.40 8:20 p.m. \u2014 Game time! We are most assuredly going to lose \u2014 the opposing team is fantastic \u2014but it's nostalgic and fun to be back at a game. We grab two more beers each (we're taking turns paying) and make friends in our section. The game is much closer than it should have been, and we're happy to see our team do better than expected. Madison Square Garden is still wild with fans, and everyone spills out onto the street for the next adventure. Advertisement 10:30 p.m. \u2014 We go to a local bar that is again packed with my school's fans, both students and alumni. While standing in line for the bathroom, my friend and I hit it off with cute guys wearing lacrosse shirts from our school. Unfortunately, we realize that they are  current  athletes and not alumni ... talk about feeling old! We quickly dodge the situation before they realize how old we are and head back to our table. We all split a pretzel and a few more drinks and divide the bill evenly at the end of the night.  $20.53 1:45 a.m. \u2014 Feeling quite proud of myself because I resisted an Uber even after all the drinks tonight! After a long subway ride home, I dive into bed and don't even make it through one episode of  Parks and Recreation  before falling asleep.

He hops out of bed to make coffee and brings me a cup in bed, a sweet little gesture he makes every morning that means a lot to me. I drink my coffee and read in bed for a while. I am obsessed with memoirs and mysteries and am currently making my way through all of Lisa Gardner's mysteries. Her plot twists are unparalleled. 11 a.m. \u2014 B. makes cinnamon toast with bread that his mom made for us! It is delicious and reminds me of what I ate for breakfast as a child. After finishing up our toast, B. pulls me back into bed for some quality time before we both head to work ;). 2 p.m. \u2014 Leave my apartment and go to work, which is only about a 15-minute trip. 3 p.m. \u2014 I eat snack with my clients and then peruse the internet. I've been waiting for a sale on glasses through EyeBuyDirect for a few weeks and today all frames are BOGO so I decide to go for it! I buy six pairs of frames knowing that I will probably return at least four. There is a tool for \"trying on\" the glasses online by uploading a photo of yourself but I never know how the glasses will look until I actually try them on at home.  $163.23 6 p.m. \u2014 Spend the afternoon hanging out with my clients, playing card games, and watching a Disney movie. Dinner is chicken fingers, seasoned fries, and carrot sticks with my clients! I dunk the carrots in a solid amount of ranch dressing because I loathe carrots. The group of clients we have right now is on the quieter side so my coworker and I spend time telling jokes. Advertisement 10 p.m. \u2014 Say goodbye to the few clients who are still awake and then go to a grocery store near my apartment. I pick up a random assortment of items including a tin of raspberries, cotton pads, ice cream, chips, milk, and turkey bacon.  $17.52 12 a.m. \u2014 After I get home I light candles (a nightly ritual for me \u2013 I am a candle maniac) and do my skincare routine. I read in bed for a while and wait for B. to come home from work. When he gets home we talk about our respective days, snuggle in bed, and eventually pass out. Daily Total: $180.75", "day_two": "Day Two: 10 a.m. \u2014 Wake up and snuggle in bed with B. for a while, the most peaceful part of my day. I usually don't set an alarm unless I have to be at work early for a meeting, which makes my slow-moving mornings that much nicer. B. makes coffee and brings me a cup in bed while I read and mess around on my phone. B. eventually joins me back in bed and we enjoy sexy time before cleaning our apartment. This is a Sunday morning ritual for us: I clean the kitchen, living room, and bedroom and B. takes on the bathroom and the vacuuming. 1 p.m. \u2014 Give B. a big kiss goodbye and go to work. Once I get there, I pick out an apple with almond butter and chat with newly admitted clients. 3 p.m. \u2014 It is an incredibly quiet day at work so I decide to do a little bit of online shopping. I see that there are super cheap tickets for a musical I love ( The Last Five Years ) so I buy two ($25) and text a friend to see if he wants to come. Thankfully, he is down and free on the night I booked the tickets! I want to do something fun and special for Valentine's Day with B. because I am mushy like that but also because it is going to be our last Valentine's Day in Seattle. (We are moving in the next few months.) I find a cool event at a distillery where you get a tasting of their liquors and then get to make your own hot chocolate with the alcohol you like the best. I buy two tickets and plan on surprising B. with them tonight! ($43.66)  $68.66 Advertisement 5:30 p.m. \u2014 Tonight, my coworker is covering dinner with the clients so I eat with another coworker in our break room. Dinner is mac and cheese with lots of hot sauce! I snag fresh veggies from the fridge to munch on as well. Once perk of working at the facility I do is that we always get meals/snacks during the workday, which definitely saves me money on food costs. (Although I love to eat out so it's probably not saving me THAT much money.) I notice that two of my Poshmark bids went through. I am the proud owner of a new sundress, earrings, and a cuff with my favorite stone, ocean jasper.  $30.98 8:30 p.m. \u2014 Eat the last snack of the day with the clients; this time I choose a Choco Taco and munch on it while playing trivia at my table. These clients know so many random animal facts, it is amazing! I learn that octopi have three hearts and that a group of parrots is called a pandemonium. After snack I head home and B. is already there since he had the day off. We snuggle on the couch, I pour myself a glass of ros\u00e9, and we watch the new  Blue Planet 2 . We are obsessed with the  Planet Earth  series and spend the next hour geeking out over how cute puffins are. 11 p.m. \u2014 Early to bed for B. and me. I do a quick face mask with Farmacy's Honey Potion (my saving grace for moisturizing \u2013 it always makes my skin glow). Then I finish up with the rest of my skincare routine: Acure's glowing serum, retinol from The Ordinary, and Origins Night-A-Mins moisturizer. Advertisement Daily Total: $99.64", "day_three": "Day Three: 9 a.m. \u2014 Up and at 'em for an early day. I complete my skincare routine (The Ordinary's Glycolic Acid 7% Toning Solution, REN Radiance Perfection Serum, One Love Organics Morning Glory Caffeinated Firming Serum, and then I mix up Kiehl's Hydro-Plumping Re-Texturizing Serum Concentrate with Caudalie Vinoperfect Radiance Serum as well as Origins Matte Moisturizer) and brush my teeth. Then, I throw on mascara and a bright red lipstick and I am good to go. Give B. a big kiss goodbye and drive to work. 10 a.m. \u2014 Answer urgent emails when I get to work and then have morning snack with the clients. Today is a banana, a spoonful of Nutella, and coffee to get the day started. 12 p.m. \u2014 Work, work, work, work, work, work. I feel like this day will never end. I was promoted to a management role a few months ago and it has been extremely busy managing my team and the clients at the same time. I snag leftover tomato soup and salad from the break room and eat at my desk (sad, I know). The tomato soup is amazing and I thank the chef who makes all the food for the clients and staff; she is a fantastic cook! 3 p.m. \u2014 I grab a brownie for snack with the clients and eat that with a glass of milk and water. It has been a tough day for the clients so I try to keep conversation light and playful. After snack, I interview a potential new hire and decide that she would be a great fit for our team. I have a couple of meetings with various coworkers that fill up my afternoon and make it pass quickly. Advertisement 6 p.m. \u2014 I jet out of work and head over to U-Village, a beautiful outdoor mall in between my work and apartment. I have my eye on a turmeric mask from Kiehl's and since they have a deal where you get extra goodies if you spend over $85, I end up buying a microdermabrasion re-texturizing scrub as well. I got a sample of this scrub a few weeks ago and haven't stopped thinking about it. I will definitely be using both the mask and scrub for a little at-home facial tonight. I poke through Anthropologie and the Gap as well but don't find anything that's calling my name. I leave the mall and drop off books at the library, picking up two new books that I had on hold \u2013  Find Her  (another Lisa Gardner mystery) and Marcus Samuelsson's memoir,  Yes, Chef.   $88.06 8:25 p.m. \u2014 I order pad Thai with extra chicken and spring rolls, and get it delivered to my apartment. With my $10-off coupon it's a pretty good deal for the amount of food that I get. I give myself a facial with my new products from Kiehl's and watch  Law & Order: SVU  while eating my dinner. I fill the bathtub and pour myself a glass of ros\u00e9 while soaking in the tub with a Lush bath bomb. The water gets cold after only 20 minutes so I hop out and moisturize head to toe.  $15.34 11 p.m. \u2014 I take a Lyft Line down to the restaurant where B. works to meet him for a drink once he gets off work.  $3.63 Advertisement 12:30 a.m. \u2014 B. and I catch up on our busy days while sitting at the bar; he orders a beer and I get a glass of ros\u00e9. We enjoy relaxing and chatting with some of his coworkers until I realize that I can't stop yawning, which means it's time to leave. The staff at B.'s restaurant loves him and they have gotten to know me pretty well, so our drinks are free! I tip the bartender $5 as a thank you. B and I enjoy the walk home from the restaurant to our apartment, which is made especially pleasant by the fact that it is not raining.  $5 Daily Total: $112.03", "day_four": "Day Four: 10:30 a.m. \u2014 Wake up and snuggle with B. before getting ready. I quickly throw on comfortable clothes, do a quick skincare routine, and brush my teeth. Give B. a kiss goodbye and leave for a doctor's appointment. I have been having abnormally high inflammation on my blood tests and my doctor has been running consistent tests to try and get to the root of the issue. I get my blood drawn and only wince a little. (I am pretty terrified of needles.) No copay because my parents' insurance is amazing. 11:20 p.m. \u2014 I notice that my gas tank is low so I fill up on my way home. I get 10 cents off per gallon due to Safeway reward points. After filling up, I drive home and watch the newest episode of  The Bachelor  while lying in bed. B. has the day off too and is watching a soccer game in the living room. I eat leftover pad Thai while I try to keep my mind off the inflammation thing; t scares me a little to know something may be wrong but not know exactly what it is. B. interrupts my pity party by providing some very welcome sexy time.  $26.81 Advertisement 2 p.m. \u2014 B. and I shower and get ready to go see a movie! We walk from our apartment toward downtown, stopping at a 7-Eleven to buy candy before the show \u2013 strawberry sour straws for me ($1.39) and B. buys his own gummy candy. We enjoy the walk to the theater and purchase tickets for  Den of Thieves  ($5).  $6.39 6 p.m. \u2014 The movie was alright; the way women were portrayed in the movie made me really mad and the general violence was not for me. I guessed the twist very early on in the movie but B. was blissfully unaware and surprised at the end. We decide to go grab food before trivia tonight and check out a couple places before settling on Rachel's Ginger Beer. B. pays for our chicken sandwiches and we dig in. I get an Asian-inspired sandwich while B. gets one with spicy sauce and jalape\u00f1os. 7:10 p.m. \u2014 We swing by one of my favorite coffee spots, where I get a caramel latte and split a pear and almond tarte with B. The coffee is delicious and we both finish the tarte in a matter of minutes. After people-watching through the window, we head over to the bar where they are hosting trivia.  $12.36 8 p.m. \u2014 B. and I manage to get seats by the bar and we are pumped for trivia. We decide on a team name and B. buys us both beers. I give him $3 to cover mine; he gets a Tecate and picks a Bohemia for me.  $3 Advertisement 10 p.m. \u2014 Whomp, whomp \u2014 history repeats itself and we score in the middle of the pack. We felt confident about a lot of our answers, but only got about 70% right. We cut our losses and start walking home. About halfway there, I get a hankering for chips (Cheddar and Sour Cream Lays are my weakness). Before I ask my boyfriend if we can stop at the store, he says he is also really craving chips. I give him a big kiss and tell him I was thinking the exact same thing! We each buy a bag of chips and walk the rest of the way home.  $3.29 11 p.m. \u2014 We arrive at our apartment and break into the chips while watching more  Blue Planet 2 . This episode is all about the deep ocean and while I find it fascinating, it also creeps me out a little. We jump in bed after finishing the episode and fall asleep spooning.

B. makes coffee, eggs, bacon, and more toast from the bread his mom made for us. We chat over breakfast and then B. heads to work \u2013 I have the day all to myself! I hop back into bed with delicious lavender Earl Grey tea and read for a while. 12 p.m. \u2014 Make another cup of tea and spend time writing in my journal while watching  America's Next Top Model  and doing a few face masks. I choose a brightening pumpkin face mask by Andalou Naturals, followed by a clay mud mask by Kiehl's, and then finish with the turmeric mask I bought a few days ago. My skin is glowing after this pampering. Advertisement 2:30 p.m. \u2014 I get a call from a market researcher and video chat with her for about half an hour. I sign up for market research and focus groups as a side hustle and I bring in a couple hundred dollars a month just by doing this for an hour or so per week. I use the gift cards and money I get from these studies to pay for skincare, clothes, and travel. This research interview pays $85 in the form of an Amazon gift card, so I peruse Amazon after finishing the call, but I don't see anything I really need at the moment. 3 p.m. \u2014 B. loves movies and we have been wanting to come up with a way to watch movies since we take forever to agree on one that will fit both of our tastes. I pick out a scratch-off movie poster online that has 100 of the top critically-acclaimed movies, which will be an amazing gift for B. for Valentine's Day. I order it and pay for express shipping so it will be here in time. I have plans to meet a friend for happy hour, so I quickly get ready and run out the door.  $22.95 4 p.m. \u2014 I drive over to a small Mexican restaurant for happy hour and order a winter sangria while I wait for my friend to arrive. I take one sip of the sangria and feel it almost immediately, so I decide to order chips, salsa, and a few tacos to soak up the alcohol before I keep drinking. My friend arrives and we have such a wonderful time catching up. He has a few margaritas and orders tacos for himself as well. In college, we used to go swing dancing almost every week. Neither of us has danced in a while, so we decide to go dancing together soon.  $36.56 Advertisement 6:30 p.m. \u2014 I arrive home feeling incredibly tired even though I did almost nothing today! I am supposed to meet another friend for a late night walk but text him and let him know that I probably am not going to make it tonight, and we take a rain check for later in the week. I crawl into bed and read my book for a few hours, then end up falling asleep for a surprise nap. 11 p.m. \u2014 Wake up with a start to my birth control alarm going off on my phone! I had no idea that I slept for so long but I feel a lot better. I take my pill and then clean up my apartment a little, doing dishes and tidying up the bathroom.

I get an email that I have been waiting for a long time: acceptance into a graduate program for my master's in counseling! I tear up a little and text my family members and boyfriend. I whip out my card and pay the $500 deposit to secure my spot for the fall, which will eventually go toward tuition for the fall semester. I have been working toward this for several years and finally feel ready to go back to school, knowing that my heart and passion is in the mental health field.  $500 4 p.m. \u2014 Drink coffee and eat animal crackers at my desk while working on training and onboarding materials as well as scheduling my team for the upcoming month. 6:30 p.m. \u2014 Leave work to meet a friend at a free DIY Valentine card-making event at a local coffee shop. I am apparently on an Earl Grey tea kick and I don't feel like drinking alcohol so I sip on that while catching up with my friend. We each make several cute cards with the provided materials.  $3.50 8:30 p.m. \u2014 I drive home and end up ordering delivery from my favorite Indian restaurant. The chicken tikka masala arrives at my door in less than 30 minutes and I am one happy gal.

Work through the afternoon, have dinner and snack with the clients, and handle some minor disasters along the way. One thing I love about my job is that I never know what is going to happen when I walk through the door in the morning. 8 p.m. \u2014 Head home to quickly put on makeup and change my clothes before going to karaoke with friends! A friend picks me up and drives me to the karaoke bar, something I really appreciate since I don't have to spend money on a Lyft.

My friend and I are visiting a close friend of ours and we sleep in much later than we expected. The friend who is hosting is already awake and so is her partner. She makes us delicious cold brew coffee, eggs, and toast. The four of us decide to head to the gym since we know we have a day of gluttony ahead of us. We hit the road (which is a bit icy from snow the night before) and work out for about an hour. 1:30 p.m. \u2014 The four of us head into downtown Albany to meet another friend for lunch. We order two orders of pretzel bites, three orders of wings, beers all around, and a salad (for balance). We are all stuffed but happy and split the bill.  $28 3:30 p.m. \u2014 My friend's partner bought a Groupon for us to do a beer tasting at a local brewery. We get to the brewery and are each given five tokens. We drink as many samples as possible before the brewery closes and play Uno. (My friend who is driving disperses her beers throughout the day.) I leave rather tipsy and play DJ in the car. Advertisement 5 p.m. \u2014 Somehow we end up at another brewery with more beer. We spend a while longer here and play Trivial Pursuit. I love the atmosphere and the beer is good. I would spend every weekend in a brewery if it were both physically and financially healthy.  $20 7 p.m. \u2014 Today just keeps going! We end up at a new casino in Schenectady. At this point I am drunk so I need to be cautious on how much I gamble. (I hear my mom's voice in my head!) I take out $20 from the ATM, play a few penny slots and electronic roulette ($20). I also somehow lose (and find!) my wallet within 10 minutes of entering the casino. I buy a beer and cocktail for my friend and then proceed to not win anything.  $30 8:30 p.m. \u2014 I need pizza so I get two slices.  $8 9:30 p.m. \u2014 Head back to my friend's place and play two rounds of Phase Ten. Then I have another beer and watch the Patriots beat the Titans. We all decide to hit the hay around 11 as we are exhausted and already hungover from the day.

My friend makes us breakfast and coffee and we finish watch a few episodes of  Chopped . 11 a.m. \u2014 I hit the road back to Worcester, only after spending 15 minutes scraping ice from my car. When I left Worcester on Friday it was 60 degrees and raining. As soon as I got to Albany, it started snowing and sleeting. I love the winter, but not when it's two degrees outside. Advertisement 12 p.m. \u2014 My travel companion and I decide we are hungry so we stop for ramen to warm our bellies (and it's freezing outside). I get miso ramen with pork and a Diet Pepsi. We split the bill and continue on our way.  $20 2 p.m. \u2014 I drop off my travel companion because she is meeting other friends for the afternoon. After I am almost back on the highway, I remember that I will need gas to make it back to Worcester.  $20 4 p.m. \u2014 Back in good ole Worcester and happy to be reunited with my kitties. I recently adopted a kitten and he and my older cat are still working on getting along. (I call them kitties collectively but my older cat is definitely middle-aged.) I play with both of them individually for a while, clean up their mess from the weekend, and settle in for a night at home. 6 p.m. \u2014 Call my parents for our nightly chat. This is something that started in college and we have continued to talk to each other every night since. It is a nice way to connect even if we don't have much to say. I cherish the conversation. 7 p.m. \u2014 After spending a significant amount of money over the weekend I opt to cook at home instead of ordering in. I make eggs and French toast. I could honestly eat breakfast for every meal. 10 p.m. \u2014 I watch an embarrassing amount of  Chopped  and decide that in my alternate reality, I'll either own my own restaurant or become Alex Guarnaschelli. I go to bed dreaming of the dessert I didn't have. Advertisement Daily Total: $40", "day_three": "Day Three: 9:30 a.m. \u2014 I get to sleep in today since my agency is closed for Martin Luther King Jr. Day. I decide that I want to have a productive but relaxing day and vow to only put a few things on my to-do list. 11 a.m. \u2014 After a quick breakfast of yogurt, apples, and honey, I head to the gym for a quick cardio session. Last summer, I ran a 10-mile race and did a sprint triathlon. I think that was maybe the last time I exercised? I vow to get back into shape and remind myself that I actually feel good when I move my body. 1 p.m. \u2014 After a shower and a quick tour-de-Pinterest, I decide to make turkey chili and creamy lemon-chicken pasta for lunch and dinner this week. I write out my list and head to the store. 1:30 p.m. \u2014 They recently built a Chick-fil-A in Worcester and despite my dislike of the company's politics, I cannot resist their chicken. I order grilled nuggets and a side salad with a Diet Coke. I get back to my car and realize they gave me regular nuggets. Oh well, guess I have to eat these.  $11 3 p.m. \u2014 Back home and feeling proud of myself for not straying from my shopping list. I unload groceries and prep for my night of cooking.  $40 5 p.m. \u2014 The chili is in the crock pot and my water is almost boiling for pasta. I munch on some Pirate's Booty and play with the kittens. Then it's pasta for dinner. Advertisement 8 p.m. \u2014 I notice that my dishwasher is leaking water onto the kitchen floor whenever I use the sink. This is something that has plagued me since I moved into my apartment three years ago and periodically returns for unknown reasons. I make a mental note to call my landlord in the morning. 10 p.m. \u2014 After a couple hours of watching  Friends  (I was one of those people that never watched growing up but now I am kind of obsessed), I crawl into bed, exhausted. Daily Total: $51", "day_four": "Day Four: 7 a.m. \u2014 My alarm goes off and I snooze for eight more minutes. After, I hesitantly get out of bed and instantly throw on my slippers and robe. I get some water boiling for my morning coffee, grounding my beans and getting my Chemex ready to go. (It's my newest toy.) I make myself eggs and an English muffin with a side of cucumber for breakfast, shower, get dressed, feed the kittens, and eat my breakfast while watching  CBS This Morning . I love Gayle! 8:30 a.m. \u2014 Get to my desk and am pleasantly surprised by my lack of emails. I sip my coffee and respond to what is there. I have a big day ahead of me as my colleagues and I are meeting with one of our funders for a new project. I have heard that this funder is intimidating and intense so I try to prep myself as much as possible. 12 p.m. \u2014 My coworkers and I typically eat lunch together and today is no different. I reheat my pasta leftovers and have an apple with peanut butter and a seltzer. Over the weekend, I discovered the Google Arts & Culture app that compares your selfie to a famous piece of artwork. Mine is ridiculous but kinda looks like me and I am not ashamed. My coworkers all take turns with my phone taking their own selfies and we spend our lunch hour cracking up. It's great to work with people who take their work seriously but also find time for pleasure in the workplace. Advertisement 4:30 p.m. \u2014 My afternoon funder meeting went extremely well and I am excited to continue work on this project. It is a financial justice project helping area residents who have no access to banking. Also exciting is the fact that our agency will be closed tomorrow since it is supposed to snow! I am really happy to work at a place that values employee safety and will cancel work (yet still pay us!) if the weather looks bad. 5:30 p.m. \u2014 Home from the gym and eating my chili. It's good but unexciting. I'd prefer tacos. 9 p.m. \u2014 A friend comes over to spend the night at my place since it's closer to her office, and she can walk to work in the morning instead of driving in the snow. I catch up with her and my housemate over a bottle of prosecco and other libations. We watch a few episodes of  Carpool Karaoke  and go to bed around midnight. Daily Total: $0", "day_five": "Day Five: 7:30 a.m. \u2014 I am awake early since my friend is heading to work and my landlord is supposed to come by with a plumber to look at my dishwasher. I have a little bit of a headache from the prosecco so I immediately drink two full glasses of water as soon as I wake up. I make coffee and egg sandwiches for my friend and me and then curl up on the couch with the kittens while I wait for the plumber. (Spoiler alert: He never comes.) I take two Advil and hope that my headache goes away soon. I decide to be productive with my early morning so I reorganize my closet and do laundry. My headache goes away after the Advil, eggs, and cheese do their job. Advertisement 12 p.m. \u2014 I find some mozzarella sticks in my freezer and decide to have those, a salad, and seltzer for lunch. I also watch more  Friends . I try to take a quick nap on the couch but for some reason cannot fall asleep. Instead I decide to do a Cup O' Coffee face mask from Lush. I love skincare products, especially ones from Lush. 2 p.m. \u2014 I must get outside! I don't do well cooped up in the house and I decide to shovel out my car and put some salt on the sidewalk. It's technically our landlord's responsibility, but I'm particular about certain things and sidewalk clearing is one of them. I also like to have some ownership over where I live despite being a renter, so this is a way for me to do that and have a safe home at the same time! 3 p.m. \u2014 I chat with my best friend who recently moved to San Francisco. I can't wait to visit her once she's settled \u2013 I miss her so much! 5 p.m. \u2014 The guy I am dating (P.) picks me up and we go to dinner and a movie. The roads are relatively clear but people are still driving horrendously. We go to a pizza place and then see  The Post  (yas, Meryl Streep). He pays for the food and beer and also the movie. Swoon. 9:30 p.m. \u2014 P. has an early morning and I am beat from the day so we part ways and I get into bed. I recently got a bamboo foam mattress pad and it is literally heaven. I chat with my friends for a bit on iMessage and read Reddit. My kitten curls up next to me.

It's really hard to get out of bed when there is a purring animal anywhere near me. I take a deep breath, move him off me, and get out of bed. I do my typical morning routine (coffee and eggs) and am out the door at 8:15. My commute only takes three minutes and I am at my desk by 8:25. 10 a.m. \u2014 My morning meeting was canceled so I have little extra time to write some speaking points for the city manager for an event later this month. I bang that out and drink my coffee and water at my desk. I snack on some dark chocolate too. 12 p.m. \u2014 Have my lunch (pasta still) and review notes for a meeting later this afternoon. I chat with P. on iMessage and look at Instagram, Facebook and Money Diaries while I eat. I also look at flights to San Francisco and download the Hopper app to help me buy tickets at the right time! 4 p.m. \u2014 I notice that my direct deposit hits, so I pay my remaining bills for the month: a credit card payment, my internet bill, and the excise tax on my car. (Thanks, Massachusetts!) 5:30 p.m. \u2014 I'm home from the gym and starving. I eat some chili with a lot of cheese and sour cream on top, then put away my clean laundry from yesterday, shower, and have my nightly chat with my parents. Advertisement 8 p.m. \u2014 I decide I want a cocktail and make myself a vodka seltzer. I also settle in and do some work for a part-time gig that I have, which is coding wire-taps for a friend's company in Philadelphia. It's an interesting way to make a few extra bucks, but it's only temporary. I have  Friends  muted on the TV. I plug in my headphones and hunker down. 10 p.m. \u2014 Finished with the taps for the night and I crawl into bed. I love food and cooking and am trying to read more instead of looking at screens before bed, so I read a few chapters of  Blood, Bones and Butter  and fall asleep. Daily Total: $0", "day_seven": "Day Seven: 7 a.m. \u2014 It's Friday and for some reason it's always easier to get out of bed on Fridays. I shower, feed the kitties and myself (eggs and coffee \u2013 I am a creature of habit), and hit the road to work. 12 p.m. \u2014 I had a series of phone conversations this morning about a different food-related project that I manage at work. I am re-energized and excited that people are interested in the work we're doing. I finish the last of my pasta and take a walk to get an Americano. It's sunny and in the mid-30s today, which is practically summer here, so I take advantage.  $3 4:30 p.m. \u2014 I submit my timesheet and am outta here! After work, I meet up with my friend and we cook a homemade dinner of steak quesadillas with strong whiskey drinks on the side. After dinner, we go to a local hockey game (sponsored by my work, so tickets are free!). Advertisement 9 p.m. \u2014 The game is a blast. It's always fun to hang with coworkers outside of the office. My friend and I head back to my place and have a couple more drinks as we get ready to go to our friends' birthday party at a local spot. After buying drinks for me and the birthday girls ($30), I Uber home around 2 a.m. covered in glitter.  $40 Daily Total: $43", "url": "https://www.refinery29.com/money-diary-worcester-ma-program-manager-salary"},

Advertisement", "day_one": "Day One: 8:30 a.m. \u2014 My boyfriend always gets up before me, which always wakes me up. I love it though: I get to roll around and scroll through the news and Instagram for a bit. It's Saturday so he's not working today. He makes us bacon, egg, and cheeses on everything bagels (which he made from scratch!) with arugula on the side. We watch  The Daily Show  while we eat on the couch; Ricky Martin is the guest and I didn't expect him to be super interesting but he has amazing energy that is actually lovely. 11 a.m. \u2014 I'm getting my period in a week, so this is always a hard time of the month for me emotionally, plus I'm stressed about a project I have. I almost want to go cry in bed but I know I'll feel way better if I work out, so I go to the climbing gym with my BF. He's paying for my membership fee as a sort of birthday present. (It's his way of trying to convince me to get back into climbing.) I climb a 5.10b-rated route that was really hard for me the other day, and today it comes more easily to me. I'm so stoked about the progress I'm making! It's my birthday tomorrow and crushing this route was a goal for me. 2 p.m. \u2014 Back home, we drink smoothies and eat leftover meatballs in a marsala cream sauce I made late last night. I also sneak in the last piece of leftover pizza while BF is outside spreading salt on our icy sidewalk. I've been joking forever that all I want for my birthday is Papa John's pizza because BF thinks it's so gross (and it is), but he finally let it happen the other day in a fit of hunger. He's the best. We hang out and nap before going out tonight. Advertisement 6 p.m. \u2014 We Uber downtown to go to a cool distillery for cocktails before dinner. BF has a whiskey sour and I have gin with grapefruit, basil, honey, and probably some other stuff. We have a hilarious and awkward encounter when a larger group at a two-top table sizes up the spots around us at the communal table and we end up switching places with them. They offer to pay for our drinks but we politely decline. BF is paying anyway since it's my birthday celebration. I pay for the Uber though.  $9.66 7 p.m. \u2014 Fine dining opportunities are limited here in Montana but we pick a place that at least has white tablecloths and looks decent. We enjoy the bread, soup, and salad courses, but we're underwhelmed by our entr\u00e9es. My short rib is practically swimming in the red wine reduction and I can't even see my mashed potatoes! We get chocolate cake for dessert and it's pretty good. BF gets the Uber home. 9:30 p.m. \u2014 Our landlord's cat is waiting outside our house, so we let her in and pet her for a while. We can't have pets in our place, but we love to be with animals every chance we get. I wash my face, use my favorite Glossier serum, and watch bad TV in bed for an hour. ( The Four  is so stupid. They all sound and look like rejects from  The Voice .) Daily Total: $9.66", "day_two": "Day Two: 9:30 a.m. \u2014 Happy birthday to me! I wake up to a few texts from friends and family. I didn't sleep great, so BF brings me tea and a buttered bagel in bed and I watch  SNL  clips from last night. Advertisement 11 a.m. \u2014 It's nice outside, so we go for a walk and talk about our plans for this year. We are moving in May, and I might be going to Europe then also, so the logistics are nagging at me. 12 p.m. \u2014 I browse Craigslist for apartments and then end up on Brandless, where I buy organic cotton rounds, two packs of organic beef jerky, shave gel, and maple cinnamon twisty things. Shipping is $1 since it's my first order with them (and I'm a sucker for a promo code). I look at ladles on Amazon but can't make up my mind. I'm very particular about my kitchen things being good quality.  $16 2 p.m. \u2014 We're watching football playoffs today. BF makes pizza dough and then we make a pie with garlic cream sauce, sausage, cherry tomatoes, red onion, and arugula \u2014 my favorite! Except we forgot to make mozzarella. (My BF makes mozzarella at home. He's such a crazy weirdo, I love it.) So we make a plain one with olive oil, salt, and red pepper flakes. 3:30 p.m. \u2014 The Patriots are winning so we're cranky. I spot the landlord's cat when I'm taking out the trash, so we get some awesome cat therapy snuggles for a bit. 4 p.m. \u2014 I want to make cookies but we don't have enough butter so I walk to the corner store and get unsalted butter, eggs, and two bags of Juanita's Sweet Chili chips. Important side note: Juanita's are the best tortilla chips. (I've only seen them out West.) The flavored ones are what Dorito's should be.  $14.19 Advertisement 5:30 p.m. \u2014 We watch the second playoff game and have cookies for dinner! We put a votive on top of one and BF sings a little \"Happy Birthday\" because I tell him to. I make a wish. 9 p.m. \u2014 Birds win! Not my wish but super awesome! BF is from the Philadelphia area so he's stoked his team is going to the Super Bowl. We met in Philly, so it's a second or third home for me, too. We head to bed early. Daily Total: $30.19", "day_three": "Day Three: 9 a.m. \u2014 BF works east coast hours so I hear him on a conference call when I wake up. We both work from home, which probably isn't ideal. (I work in bed and he gets the table.) We're still figuring out what we want to do long-term since we recently took a break to travel in a van we converted for about a year and a half. It's tricky at times to have an unconventional life, but we love the freedom. 10:30 a.m. \u2014 I make us smoothies with pineapple, frozen mangoes, strawberries, spinach, yogurt, milk, and juice, and cut up a kiwi to go on the side. It's a tropical morning inside while it snows outside! 1 p.m. \u2014 I've been struggling to come up with concepts for my current client. They've given me free reign, which is a good problem to have, but it makes it so hard for me to narrow down ideas. BF brings me little ham sandwiches on ciabatta he made (have I mentioned he's crazy and amazing?) and a LaCroix because he knows I'm cranky. Advertisement 3 p.m. \u2014 Best part of my flexible work schedule: I can go to the grocery store during off hours! I get bananas, cilantro, cherry tomatoes, paper towels, vanilla extract, cheddar cheese, local organic butter, local flour, and local sliced bread.  $42.31 4 p.m. \u2014 Score! Birthday cards from my best friend from back home and my mom, who gives me $250 without fail every birthday and Hanukkah. And packages arrived while I was out: a mid-thigh-length down coat from L.L.Bean that went on sale after I first ordered it. (I ordered it again and will return the first one, saving me $60!) I also got a throw pillow and a pack of cloth napkins from Target. We used to use paper towels with our meals and I'm so excited to switch to reusable napkins. 5:30 p.m. \u2014 BF is taking a nap so I start marinating chicken for dinner and make a yogurt sauce. I also set up the recurring payments on my health insurance for the year \u2013 one major downside of the freelance life. I'm very lucky that my family has been investing money for me all my life, but it does move me into a higher tax bracket. (Ergo, no subsidies on my health insurance and I have a crazy-high deductible.) Thankfully, I don't really use my insurance much. I got an IUD a couple years ago so I have no prescriptions. 6 p.m. \u2014 After BF gets up, I work out to a Yoga With Adriene video. Lots of repetitive vinyasas. Her videos always hit the spot. Then I cook the chicken, make rice, and chop up toppings for one of our favorite dinners: street cart chicken! As former East Coasters,  it's a dish we're nostalgic for here in Montana where the ethnic food is limited. We use a recipe from the latest  Smitten Kitchen  cookbook and for once we manage to save a little for tomorrow. Advertisement 7:30 p.m. \u2014 We hang out on the couch and look at houses and floor plans on Pinterest. We bought a piece of land last fall and hope to be able to build a house on it someday. For now it's just a field, but we'll hopefully plant a big garden there this spring. BF made early investments in Bitcoin and Ether, so he spends a lot of time tracking the charts since they're so volatile. We hope to make good use of his gains for our future. 9 p.m. \u2014 I'm super excited for season 3 of  RuPaul's Drag Race All Stars.  When I try to set a recording, I realize I never watched the season 2 reunion. There goes my night.

We're so lucky to live like this. Granted I'm not saving right now, but I'll get there. I dive into last night's  Bachelor.  So gross but I can't help myself. 11 a.m. \u2014 I smell another lazy day; I end up focusing more on my background TV than the work at hand, I can't seem to dig into this project. Maybe I should go to a coffee shop one of these days. 1 p.m. \u2014 I heat up my leftovers and make BF a sandwich since he's stuck on a call. 4 p.m. \u2014 Finally picked a ladle I like on Amazon, and get a new dishwashing brush, too. The brush is $10, which seems kind of ridiculous, but it's made of natural materials. I'm trying to minimize our use of plastic, so it's worth the extra money to me. I just wish I didn't have to order it online because I know they'll throw plastic filler in the box they ship it in, but the store doesn't have all-wood brushes.  $19.98 Advertisement 5 p.m. \u2014 We have smoothies before we go to the climbing gym with apple, pineapple, banana, almond butter, frozen mangoes and strawberries, milk, yogurt, juice, and a sprinkle of bee pollen. I have no idea what the pollen does but we've had it sitting around, so what the heck. 5:30 p.m. \u2014 We met friends at the climbing gym, which was nice but meant we stayed a little longer than normal. I did climb a 5.10c route, though, so that was cool! I need to get stronger so I'm not exhausted after just a few routes. 8 p.m. \u2014 I whip up a Thai noodle dish (pad see ew, which I get at literally every Thai restaurant I go to) in a sweet soy sauce with bok choi, broccoli, and carrot. We wolf it down on the couch watching  Black-ish , have cookies and milk for dessert, and pet the landlord's cat for a bit before bed. Daily Total: $19.98", "day_five": "Day Five: 9 a.m. \u2014 One of those mornings where I feel dead asleep like a rock but also very aware of what I'm dreaming about. BF pops in to wake me up for real. We're hopefully going snowboarding today after he does a few hours of work. This will be our second attempt this winter: Since we officially live in Montana now, we're trying to take advantage of all the outdoors things, and all our friends snowboard. The first lesson was brutal and I pray this time won't be as rough. Advertisement 9:30 a.m. \u2014 I force down Cold-Eeze gummies because I woke up feeling a little sick. BF brings me tea to huff over while he makes breakfast. He probably does more than his fair share since I'm a bit of a princess, but I think it all shakes out sort of evenly because I do a lot to keep the house running, like making sure all our bills are paid and doing laundry. I want to stay in bed and watch figure skating videos (they always make me feel better and I'm looking forward to the Olympics) but I drag myself out to the couch so we can eat together. The plate of migas he gives me makes my stomach turn a little, but I still eat most of it hoping it will make me feel better while we watch  The Daily Show . 11 a.m. \u2014 I can't make up my mind about whether we should go snowboard, but we're supposed to go to Big Sky in a couple of weeks with friends and I hope to be able to do some of the easiest runs when we're there. We suit up and I put on a thick layer of face moisturizer to prep for the outdoors. 11:30 a.m. \u2014 We get gas and start the half hour drive up to the hill. It's awesome to have all this great, inexpensive recreation nearby! It's been pretty warm so the road is wet and dirty and our car gets covered in a layer of grime. I kind of love it. Shows we've been out there!  $47.76 Advertisement 12 p.m. \u2014 Our snowboard practice costs $21 each (I pay for us both), including the rope tow on the bunny hill. I'm still not as good as I'd like to be, and I know I should cut myself some slack, but I can't help but compare myself to my BF curving down the hill effortlessly. I'm sending up huge sprays of snow as I bail out of heel-edge turns. This shit is terrifying and I don't know how I'll manage on a real run with other people zooming around. A posse of little kids learning to ski on the bunny hill rolls around adorably in the snow.  $42 2 p.m. \u2014 Despite my struggles (and one breakdown because I cry when I'm frustrated), it was a great afternoon. We stop at a deli I've been wanting to try and get an Italian sandwich, a turkey pesto one, a pickle from the barrel, and a blood orange San Pellegrino. Turns out the slaw on the Italian is mayo-based and BF won't touch it, but that's okay with me.  $25.20 3 p.m. \u2014 I vent to BF about my current project a little. He tries to help but he's an engineer, so talking about design with him can be frustrating. I reply to an email from my client and try to slip in some of my issues. Hopefully she doesn't think I'm being a total pain in the ass! 4 p.m. \u2014 Lazy afternoon; BF takes a nap and I get into those skating videos. I tell myself I'm getting better at judging the performances but there are tons of people in the YouTube comments with insane knowledge so I just read what they say and pretend I thought it too. It's really fun seeing the ladies I watched in the Olympics from 1998-2006 when I was into ice skating. I remember all the outfits and Michelle Kwan's Chinese dragon necklace that I totally copied in middle school. #Fangirl. Advertisement 7 p.m. \u2014 I watch  Fixer Upper  with my BF. They work on a tiny cabin, which is right up our alley. Then I catch the second episode of  The Assassination of Gianni Versace: American Crime Story.  It feels like all other Ryan Murphy stuff in that I kind of hate it but I keep watching until I lose interest or something better comes along. 10 p.m. \u2014 I put on a charcoal mask because I feel a zit brewing on my cheek and get in bed, focusing in on a crossword puzzle.

We have one bagel left so BF makes a bacon, egg, and cheese and we each eat half. 12 p.m. \u2014 I want to get out to see if working somewhere else can help me focus better, but I know the caf\u00e9 at the grocery store will be super busy right now. I decide to wait it out and make a smoothie with milk, juice, yogurt, apple, pineapple, banana, almond butter, bee pollen, and frozen blueberries. It's kind of a weird mixture but comes out in a pretty color! I watch  Riverdale  while I wait for the lunch rush to ease up but then end up just walking to a coffee shop nearby. We don't really need much from the store anyway. 1:30 p.m. \u2014 Wow, this coffee shop is actually kind of cool. Go, Montana! It's also kind of tiny so I'm at the cramped bar with my cappuccino, but I manage to make good progress on this project.  $3 Advertisement 3 p.m. \u2014 I hit a wall and buy a cardamom snickerdoodle cookie to help me along. It's pretty good but I only last 20 more minutes.  $5.25 4 p.m. \u2014 BF baked ciabatta while I was gone. I truly live Oprah's bread dream. We snack and catch up \u2014\u00a0and my latest Glossier purchase arrives! I can't wait to cover my face in acid and also read and reread all the instructions and ingredients, probably while peeing. 5 p.m. \u2014 BF's dad and stepmom got us two Hello Fresh gift certificates for Christmas and our first box came yesterday; we're trying the first meal tonight. BF is most excited about the orange cashew chicken so I get the rice and sauce going. Before I finish, it's time for  RuPaul's Drag Race.  This is live TV, not a drill! 7 p.m. \u2014 The Hello Fresh was a really sweet gift idea and it's tasty, but the chicken has a funny texture. On TV, BenDeLaCreme comes with the shocking elimination selection! Even though I adore Aja, I've gotta give it up: DeLa definitely deserved to win this one. 9 p.m. \u2014 We're already getting ready for bed. We're such boring old people. I tried putting on my new face acid with toilet paper (still awaiting my new cotton rounds) and I get tons of little flakes of paper stuck to me. My face feels smooth though! BF helps me struggle with last night's crossword some more. He comes up with \"peekable\" for the clue, \"see-through.\" So groan-inducing.

The fan theories and dirt on there is exceptional. 8:30 a.m. \u2014 Email from another client; I forgot this project would be starting so soon and I hope I can juggle both projects at once. This one is at least a recurring project I've been doing for a few years now, so I can kind of do it on autopilot if I want to. The style could really use a big refresh at this point but I don't know if I have the bandwidth to go there now. Maybe I'll devote time to inspiration and templating when things calm down with the larger project. 12 p.m. \u2014 I work on more concepts for the first client, and do that thing where you write an email, edit it a couple of times, look at something else for 10 minutes, and then hit send without looking at it. ( Is  that a thing?) She replies back quickly, very pleased. Holy farts, what a relief! We were thinking about going snowboarding again today because it's been snowing off and on the past couple days, but I feel like today might be better for working and running errands. (Even though the hill will be more crowded on the weekend.) 1 p.m. \u2014 I make mac and cheese with broccoli and ham and side salads. Turns out I was wrong about having a productive afternoon. Aunt Flo is here! Advertisement 2 p.m. \u2014 Since I work at home, I make a point to go outside for just a little bit every day. I walk over to a UPS drop box to send my L.L.Bean coat back. I stop at CVS, too, to get a few boxes of tissues ($5), black nail polish (my favorite toe color \u2014 $3), and a mint Oreo candy bar ($1.22). It tastes like a crunchy Andes mint and I love it. As I walk up my street I see a deer cross the road, which is totally normal here. Sometimes I feel bad about being a transplant and inadvertently contributing to the growth and sprawl that is going on, but that's just the way it is I guess.  $9.22 4 p.m. \u2014 Lie down with BF while he naps but I'm too wound up from my walk so I watch TV on my phone. I'm seriously craving carbs but BF talks me off the Domino's ledge and into spaghetti and meatballs. 5 p.m. \u2014 We watch  The Good Place  while we eat. We don't often watch shows together but we stumbled on this one and both really love it so it's nice to save it to watch together. 7 p.m. \u2014 I look at flights to Europe, and also home for a wedding this summer. It's so freaking expensive to fly anywhere from here, which kinda drives me nuts. I also really hate flying after two years of being able to drive everywhere in our van; there's nothing like being on the road and then being able to stop, make a nice lunch in the kitchen, and stretch your legs before continuing on your journey. I'm not making any decisions tonight, so my bank account is safe for now. Advertisement 9 p.m. \u2014 I pop over to Backcountry.com to see if anything good is on sale. I've been monitoring prices on Ibex stuff since they're going out of business. Do I need a third wool shirt? Probably not, but I wear them almost every day in the fall and winter, so yes ($68). I also need snowboarding lenses for sunny days and find some that fit my frames on sale for $33. I ogle a Patagonia duffel in bright violet as well, which I'd love to have for Europe this spring, but I've been on a spending bender lately so I'm just going to add that to my wish list.  $101 10:30 p.m. \u2014 Definitely time to get off the computer.

I do, but I know they'll get dirty and we'll have to shower them, which takes two hours. Plus, they just got haircuts last week and still smell good. We to flip a coin \u2014 heads for bringing them, tails for leaving them \u2014 and my boyfriend calls heads.

We brought our fancy camera with us and take great scenic and doggie pictures. Advertisement 3:30 p.m. \u2014 Finally back to the car. I take more pictures with my car for new Instagram content. (I have an Instagram dedicated to my car; it's weird, I know.) Then we head back home. 5:30 p.m. \u2014 Done with the showering! The bigger dog is exhausted and keeps falling asleep while we're showering her. Much cute; so tired. 5:45 p.m. \u2014 I review the pictures we took earlier today while my boyfriend calls his mom and brother; we decide to all go out to eat. I was born and raised a vegetarian, so sometimes it's difficult finding a restaurant that caters to everyone. Usually we can go anywhere but my boyfriend's family is on the Keto diet right now and today is a bit different. 6:45 p.m. \u2014 We wait out the very long line at the restaurant we picked because it'll take at least another 20 minutes to find another place. After we get seated and order, we catch up on everything that's been going on in our lives. My veggie omelet arrives and turns out amazing, complete with hash browns and pancakes. My boyfriend's mom pays. 8:15 p.m. \u2014 On the way home, we decide to stop by the Chinese supermarket to get a few groceries. My boyfriend's mom and brother join us because they're looking for Chinese BBQ sauce. We get frozen veggies, fish, two bags of edamame, Chinese eggplant, long string beans, Sriracha, veggie canned duck, and veggie rou song. I pay with cash.  $35.76 Advertisement 9 p.m. \u2014 My boyfriend's mom and brother stop by our place afterwards for a bit and to say hi to our dogs. While they're all talking, I pack up Etsy orders from my shop that are ready to ship. My shop is mostly dedicated to selling handmade hair accessories and it's well worth maintaining for the amount of money I make from it. Plus, sewing is therapeutic. I made about $100 this week, which is not bad! 10:30 p.m. \u2014 They leave to go back home and I head straight to bed. I scroll through the Internet until I fall asleep at 11:30.

Fail. I don't want to turn around so I just hope they'll be okay until I go home for lunch. 9 a.m. \u2014 I put aside my egg sandwich and see that another department has brownies. I take one and eat it at my desk. Advertisement 10 a.m. \u2014 I get a phone call from a recruiter saying that one of the companies I applied to wants to do a phone interview with me later this week.

I call my mom every day after I get home from work so she knows that I'm safe. (Otherwise she freaks out.) She's been sick the last few days so I encourage her to make a doctor's appointment and get antibiotics. 5:45 p.m. \u2014 I'm in the car with my boyfriend on the way to the gym when my sister calls me. She had a miscarriage recently and is still recovering, physically and mentally. I sent her a little gift from Etsy and she just received it, so she calls to thank me and to tell me how she's doing. 6:15 p.m. \u2014 Bench press day! The flat benches are taken so my boyfriend and I head to the incline bench. Why is the gym so packed?! We do chest, triceps, and shoulders and then go to the sauna.

We end with rows and the sauna. 8:30 p.m. \u2014 After the shower, I decide to make myself instant noodles and add in tofu, broccoli, edamame, two eggs, soy paste, and sesame oil. The end result turns out nothing like it's supposed to taste but it's still good and at least I'm getting protein in so I don't have to feel that bad about eating packaged noodles. 10:30 p.m. \u2014 I spend the rest of the night preparing for my phone interview and am asleep by 11:30.

I sign up for a stock alert email. 12:30 p.m. \u2014 I heat up the second half of my pad Thai for lunch and grab a bag of Sun Chips from our office snack cabinet. I'm back on the Kenzo website. I convince myself that I should go for the heeled boots instead of the flat while they are on sale. Free shipping and the fact that we are returning the sneakers soften the blow.  $228 1 p.m. \u2014 We need a new voice recorder for work, so I buy two on Amazon Prime that have the best reviews.

A. cleans snow off my car (what a gem) while I bundle up for the weather. 9:30 a.m. \u2014 The drive to the office was easy because the roads are fairly clear. Someone brought in a giant container of chocolate chip cookies and I help myself to two. These will be gone by lunchtime in my office. 12 p.m. \u2014 I have a 12 o'clock meeting on Wednesdays so I grab the container of pub mix in our kitchen and bring it to the conference room to snack on.

It looks great! I have been volunteering for them for five years now by offering my graphic design skills pro bono. I text A. and ask if he wants to buy us two tickets because his company might expense the event. 3:45 p.m. \u2014 Snacktime. I raid the kitchen for a handful of candied pecans and a bag of Sun Chips. Free snacks are crucial. Advertisement 7 p.m. \u2014 Today was crazy busy. I finally call it quits at 7.

It helps me focus to get fresh air and move throughout the day. I can't sit too long.

A. and I think it is important to meet your representatives face to face, so we try to attend events and town hall meetings. 8:30 a.m. \u2014 Breakfast is packed. I am so happy so many people are here to support women running for office. We manage to get a bagel, coffee, and some pastries from the self-serve buffet. 10:30 a.m. \u2014 After breakfast, we head to the march to meet up with A.'s parents and uncle. We walk to the town hall to grab a spot and see the speakers and newly-elected governor. (BYE, CHRIS.) We manage to meet up with more family friends while we listen to the speakers. Around noon, we begin the march to the park in the middle of town. There are so many people; it's a huge turnout. At the park, the new governor is supposed to speak but he defers to his wife, who talks about a time she was sexually assaulted. I am a ball of tears. It's hard to hear but I am happy she told her story.

There are a lot of people, food, and wine, and it turns out to be a great time. I indulge in more than a few glasses of wine. 6:20 p.m. \u2014 We decide to leave the housewarming party with a group of friends to go get drinks. We try three different places before finding a fancy cocktail bar that isn't packed. The group orders cocktails and appetizers but I don't eat because I'm stuffed from 2 p.m. burritos.

I also pick up Breathe Right strips since I'm sleeping over at N.'s house tonight. I've recently started snoring (something I detest in other people when they sleep) and it's been disturbing him. I feel like a shitty hypocrite.  $8.20 7 p.m. \u2014 Catch another Uber back to the office and take a short nap. ($14.29 expensed) 7:15 p.m. \u2014 I get a bit of a tummy ache and am stuck in the bathroom for a bit. Things get kind of weird when my other producer starts asking me questions from outside the bathroom about work. I yell back saying that she can text me instead of asking me through the door, but she says it's important and then goes quiet. I exit the toilet and realize that the office lights have been switched off. What's going on? My colleagues surprise me with a huge \"Surprise!\" and sing \"Happy Birthday\" to me! My birthday's tomorrow and it's a really nice thing of them to do. They take a couple of photos and the office cat tries to swipe a taste of the cake. I pick the little guy up and pose for a photo. 7:45 p.m. \u2014 I finish the cake with my colleagues and get back to finishing a copywriting job. I'm staying late in the office today as N.'s flight from Bangkok lands at 8:30, and I'll meet him at his place. Advertisement 8:45 p.m. \u2014 I walk to the nearest train station to get to N.'s place. I tap in with my preloaded train card and switch trains from the yellow to the purple and finally the green line. 9:45 p.m. \u2014 N. is ecstatic to see me. We haven't seen each other since mid-December as he was spending time with his family. I've really enjoyed spending time with him for the past two months and our relationship was kind of going somewhere, although it's not so great now. His company is in a bit of a situation and there's a huge possibility that he'll be returning to Switzerland. We sit down and talk about how things will progress and decide to go with the flow and enjoy what we have now. It's shitty but we try not to think about it. We snuggle and watch  Peep Show . 12 a.m. \u2014 He surprises me with a small ice cream cake and a candle. I get pretty emotional soon after as I receive a message from my mom, whom I haven't spoken to in three months. I moved out in September as things were very rough at home and my mental health was deteriorating. It's very uncommon for Asian kids to move out, especially at my age, so I've been a bit of a black sheep in the family. She apologizes for the things she said and did and asks if we can have dinner next week. I decide not to reply yet and cry for a little bit in N.'s arms.

Apparently, with the flu and my snoring, it just got worse! I feel super bad and crawl out of bed to snooze on the sofa. N. refuses to let me sleep on the sofa and drags me back in. He's a swell guy; I'm going to be really sad when he leaves. 8 a.m. \u2014 We roll in bed some more and then quickly get ready for work. I have to be at the media campus by 8:45 and book an Uber. N. yells from the shower that he'll get reservations for my birthday dinner tonight. He gives me a wet kiss and I run down to catch the Uber.

We vaguely talk about our appraisals and complain a little about issues in the project. 12 p.m. \u2014 I cuddle the office kitty for a bit and continue sourcing dresses for other talent. This is getting annoying due to unreasonable demands... 1:30 p.m. \u2014 A group of colleagues and I head out for lunch. I'm not very hungry and order chicken cutlet rice and iced tea.  $4.51 6:30 p.m. \u2014 As the day goes by, it gets really busy. I panic as I was supposed to leave an hour and a half ago to pack things to stay over at N.'s and then get the train to meet him for dinner in town. That's definitely not happening. I call an Uber back home ($5.26), pack up most of my things, and then book another Uber to meet him. I use a $5 discount code ($5.26).  $10.52 Advertisement 7:15 p.m. \u2014 I am shook! I got a text from N. before seeing him saying that he wanted to get me something for my birthday but wasn't sure if it would be the right pick. After we kiss hello, he takes me to a bookstore and points to a Dan Brown book. Confused, I ask why Dan Brown (nothing bad about DB, just saying) and he cheekily tells me he's pulling my leg. Amused, I walk with him towards a game shop and he asks the shop owner to pick up the \"reserved gift\" \u2014 a brand new PlayStation 4! I've wanted one since last year but never bought it because it was more of a want than a need and I could definitely use the savings for much more important things. I get slightly tearful and give him the biggest hug ever. We also get a couple of games to play later. I'm excited! 7:50 p.m. \u2014 Since N. got me the PS4, I call an Uber to get to our dinner location.  $5.26 10 p.m. \u2014 Dinner was at a popular Mexican place on a quaint hill in town. We have a reservation on the terrace with sparkling fairy lights. We order totopos con todo with salsa roja, pi\u00f1a habanero salsa and guacamole, tostada de at\u00fan, pollo quesadilla, tacos (carnitas, chorizo con res, camar\u00f3nes), a margarita (for me), two micheladas with Coronas (for N.) and four shots of mezcal.

But first I call PlayStation Hong Kong to remove two-step verification from my original account. I've been procrastinating on this since November. It takes a while (their security is top notch!) and all's settled.

I've been meaning to try GuavaPass for the longest time and now they're offering a six-month unlimited class pass at $44. I go for it. The classes are all super interesting!

This is probably the result of taking the medicine without eating anything. I grumble the whole way with N. sympathetically patting my back. I see that the pastries that I found so delicious on set yesterday are being sold in the mall, and I wolf one down and feel much better ($2.60). I hate forgetting to eat. N. gets two grilled chicken burritos with tons of veggies and rice and bubble tea. When we settle in on the sofa back at the apartment, we look at each other and realize we didn't get groceries. Doy!  $2.60 Advertisement 3:30 p.m. \u2014 We play Overcooked on the PS4 while the kitty nibbles on our ears. Around 5, I get sleepy and take a nap.

My best friend got us tickets to  Call Me By Your Name  and for some reason, I thought it was at 1:45. Turns out it's at 8 p.m.! My best friend and I make plans for me to return the kitty back to the office, set up the PS4 at my place, and take the bus to a dinner place near the movie theatre. N. has his helper coming over at 3 p.m. to clean up and he has to study too. We agree to meet up again after the movie ends. For now, we head out to get lunch.

N. gets lor mee (a Chinese-inspired dish with thick, starchy gravy and yellow noodles) with shark nuggets. I chastise him quietly for contributing to the extinction of sharks. He pays for our lunch and we walk back, looking around at the quaint houses in his neighborhood; it's pretty gentrified but still so beautiful. We also get two pricey but delicious coffees at a nearby hipster caf\u00e9. N. covers this as well. 2:30 p.m. \u2014 I kiss N. goodbye and he gets ready to call his family. He's an Orthodox Christian and apparently, it's Christmas today. I wait for the UberPet to take me to the office and use my boss' card again. The kitty looks kinda bummed to leave. 3:30 p.m. \u2014 I handle the kitty's needs and meet up with my best friend to take the bus back to my place. We discuss the movie and my friend's enlistment life. 4 p.m. \u2014 We play Overcooked! It starts to rain heavily and we worry a little about how to get to the dinner place. I quickly do a load of laundry and we leave. 6:30 p.m. \u2014 We get to the place on time and I get kind of suspicious when my best friend starts looking shifty. He brings me out to the patio and one of my best girlfriends is sitting there! Apparently, they've been planning to surprise me for a while. I am definitely surprised and am very happy to see my friend. We have a nice dinner of chicken karaage don (me) and kimchi ramen (best friend). They decline my efforts to pay.

I am mortified and also very amused. They know I hate grand gestures and snap photos of me looking embarrassed as heck. We stash the balloons in my friend's car and head up to the movie. It's a small, local theater that mostly screens indie films. We get three bottles of Evian, Thai iced tea, and fries. They pay for this, too. 10:30 p.m. \u2014 That. Was. Amazing. Holy shit, it was so good! Armie Hammer looks so delicious. Kinda sucks as he and Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet reportedly support terrible men as directors (whom I will not bother to name).

I pick up three pairs ($29) at my local shop, along with bobby pins ($3.50) and concealer ($8)  $40.50 8 p.m. \u2014 We meet for drinks at a winery. We each buy rounds ($34) and share tapas ($20 but my date pays). It's a lovely, cozy place; everyone is very friendly and the wine is excellent. We leave to catch a late movie showing.  $34 9:45 p.m. \u2014 We just make it on time to see  Molly's Game . I insist on paying for my own ticket but the guys are sneaky and beat us to it. So, I pay for the popcorn ($17) and my friend pays for the drinks. We all enjoy the movie a lot; Jessica Chastain never disappoints. It's long past midnight when we come out and I'm very tired. I call an Uber and my date waits for it with me. It was a lovely evening. I don't have dates or even nights out very often.  $17 Advertisement Daily Total: $156.50", "day_seven": "Day Seven: 9 a.m. \u2014 It's Sunday! My favorite day of the week. I love how everything slows down on a Sunday; lazy days are the best. I ask my neighbor to watch my daughter, who is still asleep, while I get breakfast. It's an agreement we have: I get croissants, pains au chocolat, and baguettes ($6.50) and I give a couple to my neighbor as a thank you. I also get a small bouquet of wild flowers from a stall by the shop ($6). I also buy ingredients for lasagna at the small grocery store next to the bakery ($17)  $29.50 1 p.m. \u2014 We eat the vegetable lasagna I made earlier and watch  My Neighbor Totoro  on pay-per-view ($6.20).

I usually like Monday mornings; I like waking up at 6 a.m., working out in my apartment, having a nice breakfast, and starting the week off right. But after being sick for an entire month, this is  not  one of those Mondays. I barely make it out of bed to wash my face (I'm  deep  into Korean skincare) and heat up oats, which I mix with peanut butter and chia seeds. I also have a much needed cup of coffee with almond milk to try to turn myself into a person who can entertain tiny humans all day. I take a multivitamin, a turmeric capsule, and a fiber supplement. They're a bit costly but my body needs the extra help right now. Advertisement 8:30 a.m. \u2014 I arrive at work (a 12-minute walk from my apartment) and again try to shake myself into being prepared for the day. I really like my job most of the time, but as an introvert, teaching wipes me out and being sick is not helping. (It's not a normal type of cold, either, but this strange dizziness I've been feeling constantly.) Thankfully, I only have three classes on Mondays and they're all third grade, which is honestly the easiest grade I teach. I can do this. 12:10 p.m. \u2014 Lunchtime, finally. Korean school lunches are fantastic. Today's is multigrain rice, kimchi, shredded potatoes, seaweed soybean soup, and breaded chicken with green onions. The cost of lunch is roughly $2.70 a meal, and it's taken out of my paycheck each month. I take another fiber supplement with lunch. 2 p.m. \u2014 Thanks to the aforementioned dizziness, I leave work early today to talk with my doctor. He tells me the blood work I had done last week came back clean. Then he does an ultrasound on my back, since I have some bumps that I want to get checked out, and takes a couple of X-rays. Neither provides any insight into what's going on with my body. Over an hour later, I leave frustrated and with essentially no answers. He does prescribe medication that he thinks will help, though, plus antibiotics for a small infection in my throat and probiotics for my constipation. Picking up prescribed medicine is always easy in Korea because in every commercial building there's at least one clinic and one pharmacy. Usually, you get prescribed enough medicine for three days worth of treatment, which then gets divided and packaged into breakfast, lunch, and dinner sections.  $28.76 Advertisement 3:45 p.m. \u2014 On my way home, I pick up a couple of things at the store: bananas (I like them in my morning oats) and crackers for a taste-testing activity I'm doing at work tomorrow.  $4.67 6 p.m. \u2014 I like the idea of cooking but I haven't matured enough to the point of taking the time and money to do it well, so my meals are always simple. Dinner tonight is my go-to stir fry: tofu in sesame oil and soy sauce, bean sprouts, bell pepper, spinach, and multigrain rice. I also take my fiber supplement again, plus the cocktail of drugs the doctor prescribed, and chocolate afterward. 8 p.m. \u2014 I usually go to sleep around 10 p.m. but I'm so exhausted I go to bed much earlier. At night, my Korean skincare routine really comes out \u2014 cleanser, toner, essence, vitamin C serum, eye cream, and moisturizer. It sounds excessive but I can honestly see how much brighter and happier my skin is because of it. After my routine, I write in my diary and go to bed with Trevor Noah's  Born a Crime . Daily Total: $33.43", "day_two": "Day Two: 6:40 a.m. \u2014 I get up early today to shower before work. (Showering is something I'm willing to put off for a day, but not two.) After my shower, I put on toner, face moisturizer, argan oil hair essence, and then heat up my usual oats. I drink coffee and take my multivitamin, turmeric, fiber, and medicine from the doctor. It's a lot of pills. I feel like I'm 87. Advertisement 8:30 a.m. \u2014 I'm back at work, not feeling like the medicine has done much of anything, but that's life. The doctor's pretty sure I have a type of vertigo that I'm just going to have to wait out. My fifth graders have been learning words to describe the taste, and today we're going to be taste testing various foods. It's going to be a long day, so I've got to pull it together. 12:10 p.m. \u2014 I truly love lunch time. Today is kimchi soup with tofu, multigrain rice, radish kimchi, a green root vegetable I still can't identify, and a small cheese omelet. It's enough to keep me going through my last class at 1 p.m. I also take my fiber supplements and medicine again. 2 p.m. \u2014 After finishing my last class, I'm at my desk with a free cup of coffee from my office. We used to have a lot of snacks at work that we'd all pitch in for, but the times have changed, and coffee and tea are all I get now. I watch YouTube videos for a bit and then plan my classes. 4:30 p.m. \u2014 I like to go for a walk after work but I'm really not up for it today; being dizzy constantly is exhausting, so I just walk home and tidy up. My laundry's been hanging up in the middle of my kitchen for a bit too long now. 6 p.m. \u2014 For dinner tonight, I'm having an omelet with two eggs, cheese, ham, and spinach, with a carrot on the side and sweet potatoes with jam for dessert. And chocolate. Oh right, and my fiber and medicine. I know they say you're not supposed to watch TV when eating, but I'm a rebel and turn to Netflix for the rest of the night. Advertisement 8 p.m. \u2014 It's time again to wind down with my skincare routine and to brush and floss my teeth. I switch off the main lights and turn on my fairy lights so my brain relaxes more naturally before lights out. Daily Total: $0", "day_three": "Day Three: 7 a.m. \u2014 I go through the motions and figure out what to wear. I can't explain it, but I seem to care more about what I wear when I teach sixth grade than other grades, which I will be doing today. I put on a blazer before grabbing my umbrella and heading out into the rain. 8:30 a.m. \u2014 Wednesday and Thursday are my longest days of the week: I have five classes before lunch and an after-school class from 6:30 to 8 p.m., which I teach alone and make all of the materials for. I haven't yet made any materials for my class tonight, nor did I have time to pack a snack or lunch, so today should be fun. 12:10 p.m. \u2014 We have the usual multigrain rice and radish kimchi for lunch, plus tofu with soy sauce, a root vegetable covered in a sweet red sauce, and some sort of soup with beef, egg, and noodles. 1 p.m. \u2014 It's time for my afternoon coffee, which I make after downing my many pills and a substantial amount of water. A small part of me worries that the acid in the coffee will disintegrate the pills I'm taking but I always drink coffee anyway. I need the caffeine to focus and plan the class I have to teach this evening. Advertisement 4:50 p.m. \u2014 Since I didn't pack dinner, I'm walking home tonight to eat before going back to work. It's nice to go home and watch a little Netflix, eat my leftover stir-fry, and take my fiber and medicine in the privacy of my own home, but it does make going back to work harder. At least the rain has stopped. 8:10 p.m. \u2014 I manage to make it through my after-school class in a good mood thanks to the sweet and hardworking girls I teach. On my way home, I stop at a convenience store for an ice cream bar.  $1.87 9 p.m. \u2014 I do my skincare routine, write in my journal, and make it into bed by 9:45, only to stare at my phone for a while. It's literally the opposite of relaxing even though I do it with that intention. I really need to fix this habit. I fall asleep around 11.

On Thursdays, I like to use a quick hair mask because my hair's really over-processed and needs all the help it can get. 7:20 a.m. \u2014 I've run out of oats and have to improvise for breakfast. I heat up sweet potatoes to put jam on, grab a banana, and crack open a hard-boiled egg. I eat the oats more out of necessity than desire (I'm struggling with IBS, thus the fiber supplements), so it's kind of nice having a change of pace. I take my usual supplement load, still feeling 87 years old. Advertisement 8:35 a.m. \u2014 I get to school a little late, but I honestly don't care with all of this dizziness going on. At least I'm showing up. Today, I teach sixth grade for three periods and then third grade for two, followed by lunch. Thankfully these are my nicer sixth graders (not to say I have favorite classes or anything, but there are definitely some that are easier to teach...). I can do it. 1 p.m. \u2014 I hoped a miracle would happen that would give me early lunch again, but I have no such luck and have to wait it out until 1 p.m. Feeling dizzier than usual, I make my way to the cafeteria, where we have rice, kimchi, rice cake soup, kimchi pancakes, a pork and vegetable mixture, and apple slices. 1:30 p.m. \u2014 After lunch, it's time for my fiber and medicine. Since I was only given three days worth of medicine, this is the last dosage I have left. I'm not sure if I'm going to go back for more we'll see. It's also time for coffee, planning my classes, and preparing an article for my weekend tutoring session. 5 p.m. \u2014 I walk home for dinner again because I did not have enough time this morning to pack food. Tonight, I'm mixing tuna, bean sprouts, and carrots with multigrain rice for what is probably my simplest meal yet. I'm running out of options and need to go grocery shopping soon. 9 p.m. \u2014 With my after-school class finished for the week, I feel so relieved. It's a nice way to make a little extra money but it's definitely a commitment. Now it's time to wind down again. The lights are down, my various essences and serums are have been applied, and I sit down with my diary and laptop. I can't stop watching interviews with the  Avengers: Infinity War  cast. I'm so excited for this movie! I think I'm going to try to see it this weekend.

Still dizzy, but managing. TGIF. I gather my combination of sweet potato, jam, hard-boiled egg, banana, and coffee, grab my supplements, put together an outfit, and happily leave for work. 8:35 a.m. \u2014 I've stopped caring about being a few minutes late at this point, especially on Fridays. I saw a fifth grader who was just as late as me run down the street to school, and I couldn't help but laugh. At least he cares. (Students have to be in their homerooms by 8:30, but I don't start class until 9.) Today, I teach four classes of fourth grade and one of fifth before lunch. All of these classes are quite well-behaved, so I'm feeling much better about life today. Things are on the upswing. 1 p.m. \u2014 I cannot properly convey the bliss I feel when I sit down for lunch every Friday. I have made it through the week! It's truly a special time. Today's lunch is spaghetti (which I have learned to eat with chopsticks), chicken and rice soup, radish kimchi, kiwis, and something they call pizza that is actually a tortilla wrapped up with cheese, cubed ham, and corn inside. It's not the best-tasting thing to come out of the kitchen, but the kids like it. 2 p.m. \u2014 It's time for fiber and coffee. The fiber I take is in the form of psyllium husk capsules, which I get online because it's the only kind of fiber supplement known to not aggravate IBS. I should be planning classes today, but I'm just going to sit at my desk watching more interviews with the  Avengers: Infinity War  cast until I finish at 4:30. I've made plans to go see the movie later tonight with my friends. Advertisement 6 p.m. \u2014 Joined by three of my closest friends, I get on the bus ($1.17) to head to the movie theater. It takes us about 30 minutes to get there from our part of the city. I'm not a very social person during the week, which is mostly due to how exhausted I get from teaching, but on Fridays, I always try to see my friends.  $1.17 6:45 p.m. \u2014 We go to the theater early to get tickets and are all surprised by how cheap they are. (We're all foreigners living in Korea.)  $11.24 7:40 p.m. \u2014 Eating out in Korea is a community event; portions are rarely intended for one person. We find a chicken place near the movie theater (fried chicken in Korea is so much better than American fried chicken, and I'm ready to fight about it) where we devour a platter of crispy fried chicken and a side of cheese balls. We split the cost. It's typical to have fried chicken with beer here (there's a Korean word specifically for that), but we plan on having soda and snacks at the movie and thus decide against the beer this time. It's so nice to get together on a Friday and enjoy good food and good company as we share our horror stories from the week.  $6.24 8 p.m. \u2014 My friend and I decide to each get sodas and then share candy and popcorn, and it only costs us about $10 total.  $4.75 11 p.m. \u2014 Wow, that movie was fantastic. I definitely enjoyed it a bit more than my friends did, as they'd only seen a couple of Marvel films in the past, but they still had a good time. We hop in a cab, which ends up costing $7.86, and my friend is generous enough to cover it. I walk around with my friend for a little after getting back home (it's plenty safe to do that here, even surrounded by drunk businessmen), and then we go home. Advertisement 11:30 p.m. \u2014 I remember that I don't have chocolate in my house and even after everything I've eaten today, it seems important, so I stop by the convenience store across the street for a bar of chocolate and generic egg cookies (think Nilla Wafers). I eat as I obsessively look up all of the theories about  Infinity War  and try to get information about similar things that happened in the comic books to give me an idea of how the next  Avengers  movie will go. I wipe my face with a cleansing cloth and go to sleep around 1 a.m.  $2.80 Daily Total: $26.20", "day_six": "Day Six: 11:45 a.m. \u2014 I woke up around 9:30 today but didn't get out of bed until 11 or so.

I eat a banana and the rest of those egg cookies with peanut butter. Then I fry up the last egg in my house and put it on slices of ham with cheese. It doesn't make much sense, but it's enough to take my vitamins and fiber with. After, I go back to lying in bed, watching  Infinity War  cast interviews and reading theories about the movie. I lay in bed until 6 p.m. 7:15 p.m. \u2014 After walking around for an hour to get in a bit of activity on my very sleepy Saturday, I stop by a nearby Paris Baguette for a salad, pastry, and juice.

Despite the time restriction, I take time cleaning my floors, dishes, and drains, still with enough time for my two showers. (On Sundays, I hop in the shower to shampoo, then towel dry my hair, apply an argan oil hair mask, do things around the house as I leave that on for 20-60 minutes, and then hop back in the shower to wash it out.) 11:30 a.m. \u2014 Running out of options for breakfast, I make a smoothie with what's left of my almond milk, banana, chia seeds, frozen pineapple, blueberries, and protein powder. I have almost nothing left in my fridge but I don't have time to worry about that. I have to get dressed, put on my makeup, and run out the door. 12:15 p.m. \u2014 Everything about my tutoring sessions is lovely, except for the fact that I have to take the bus for 40 minutes to get there ($1.17). Thankfully, it's my only expense today; the woman I tutor buys me coffee and even surprises me with salad and a sandwich for lunch from a nearby bakery!

We wake up and grab donuts first; the donut holes I ordered are slightly dry, but the sprinkled one is better. We get a large coffee to share that's too hot to drink.  $5 11:45 a.m. \u2014 We find a place to eat lunch on Yelp and decide to try it out. We split a sandwich and BF pays. 3 p.m. \u2014 We finally make it to the first winery; the wine is amazing and BF buys a bottle of Sangiovese. I don't know that much about wine but I usually prefer whites. We go across the street next, which ends up being crazy since everyone is already drunk. They show us a long list of all the tasters they give out for free and we get excited. I get a bit buzzed and purchase honey chipotle almonds that spill all over the counter when I try to open the bag. Yep, I am drunk. BF drives us to the hot springs.  $6 Advertisement 4:30 p.m. \u2014 We go to watch the sun set at the hot springs. They're nice but the view isn't the best since it is winter and the grape fields are barren. I also end up destroying a silver necklace wearing it in the water! BF pays and also gets us a bottle of champagne to share. 6:30 p.m. \u2014 I am craving Thai, so we find a place neither of us has tried on Yelp. I order pad Thai and BF orders mango curry. I also get us spring rolls. We had a fun day, but it's time to drive back.  $40 8:30 p.m. \u2014 BF is still driving and he needs a Red Bull. I fill up the gas tank while he also buys Reese's Peanut Butter Cups. We eat a lot and contemplate getting boba, but decide we aren't craving it enough.

I decide to grab leggings and a sweater and take her out before getting ready. Later, I make the bed, wash my face, and do my three-minute makeup routine (foundation, concealer, curl eyelashes). Luckily, most Catalan women don't wear makeup, so I won't stand out for doing the minimum. Advertisement 8:35 a.m. \u2014 Bike to the train and skip my usual pastry stop today. I've got yogurt at the office and the train takes an hour door to door. (I buy an unlimited metro pass quarterly, but only use it to go to work on the train since I bike everywhere else.) I hate the commute, but watch  Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt  on my phone and zone out. 9:30 a.m. \u2014 At the office, I grab coffee with milk. The coffee is free, but I upgrade to organic and share with a colleague. This week is my turn to pay, $1.50 for the liter. When I'm done, I grab  yogurt and add a spoonful of black-cherry-and-dark-chocolate jam from France, a gift from family friends I hosted a few weeks ago.  $1.50 1 p.m. \u2014 Starving! I spent the morning preparing analytics and weekly reports for my CEO and checking in with my team. It went quickly while I listened to \"Your Release Radar\" on Spotify. I grab some of my team members and head up to the canteen-style restaurant my work pays for at lunch. The food is always lukewarm and never great, but it's free. I grab disappointing potatoes, a grilled chicken breast, overcooked broccoli, a sparkling water, and two tiny, chocolate-covered profiteroles. Sometimes I think about bringing my own food, but I'd lose the interaction with my colleagues and would spend more money. I'm back at work within 35 minutes. ($10 expensed) 2:30 p.m. \u2014 It's someone's birthday, and there's a tradition that the person whose birthday it is brings breakfast pastries. They show up after lunch, but they smell like preservatives and are presented in boxes lined with plastic sheets. I pass and get back to work. Advertisement 7 p.m. \u2014 Whoops! It's 30 minutes past when I should have gone to get my dog. I leave a few things for the morning, slap on the noise-cancelling headphones, and head for the train. My dog has a knee injury right now, and I know she's going to be a handful. 9 p.m. \u2014 I have leftover butternut-squash-and-ricotta filling that I made on Sunday afternoon, so I whip up a batch of fresh pasta and roll out sloppy tortelloni. When you know how to make it, it goes pretty fast and is satisfying. I make a small salad with radish, fennel, and lettuce, and while I'm cooking, my boyfriend shows up unexpectedly to join. After dinner, I squeeze in 30 minutes of yoga. 10 p.m. \u2014 It's the last hours of Cyber Monday in the States, and I'm headed back for the holidays. I stock up on some of my favorite skincare items I haven't found here, and order a couple of toners from Boscia at a discount. I'm tempted to pick up stuff from Herbivore, but I'm on a tight budget to pay off my credit debt, and I resist since I'm not 100% out of the products yet, and it's only 25% off.  $46.95 10:30 p.m. \u2014 Last dog walk of the night. I live in the pedestrian historic center and the Christmas lights are already out. They're strung to one of my balconies, in fact. I think about how rent in my neighborhood has gone up 40% in three years, and hope my landlord doesn't raise my rent. I also buy chocolate H\u00e4agen-Dazs ice cream in a moment of weakness. I get home and am asleep by midnight.  $8 Advertisement Daily Total: $56.45", "day_two": "Day Two: 7:45 a.m. \u2014 I hit snooze for 10 minutes. I finally get up and do my skincare routine and makeup; I usually shower at night. I don't have to be to work as early today, so I take the pup to our favorite coffee place where she can socialize a bit; she's still not allowed to exercise due to her knee injury. I order two six-ounce flat whites, but use my prepaid card. (It's five coffees for \u20ac10 euros, about $12, instead of \u20ac2.50 to \u20ac3 each.) 10 a.m. \u2014 I arrive at work, caffeinated, and grab a yogurt before sitting down to go through email and organize my day. Amazingly, my calendar isn't full of meetings, so I might be able to check off looming tasks on my to-do list. Looks like it will be a good day at work. 1 p.m. \u2014 So hungry! At the company canteen again, but I decide to get a 'full meal' today instead of a single plate and pay an extra \u20ac1.60 for it. I get fideu\u00e0 (the Catalan version of paella, but with noodles instead of rice), pork cutlet with vegetables, and a baked apple. My neck is killing me from being at my desk, and I resist booking a massage.  $2.15 4:40 p.m. \u2014 Need to walk around a bit, so I run down three double-flights of stairs to grab a Kit Kat and back up again.  $1 7 p.m. \u2014 Made it home and boyfriend is already there visiting with my dog. I kick him out for a bit and do 35 minutes of yoga to unwind after being at my desk. I sit on a ball at work, but it's not enough to avoid serious pain in my thoracic spine. Later, I heat leftover pulled pork with a scoop of polenta and steamed cabbage with carrots. I make fried rice with carrots and cabbage for my boyfriend, who isn't feeling well. Advertisement 11 p.m. \u2014 After we take a nice, calm walk with the pup, I browse the J.Crew sale but don't find anything compelling. We go to bed for the night; my boyfriend will take dog out in the morning so I can sleep in 30 minutes longer. Sweet, sweet sleep. Daily Total: $3.15", "day_three": "Day Three: 10 a.m. \u2014 I was up and out the door by 8:45 a.m. today. I grab my usual office breakfast, then dig into my email. I chat with a few other team leaders at our coffee bar about an upcoming organizational meeting. 1 p.m. \u2014 I'm starving and spent the last 10 minutes zoned out staring at my dog on the webcam. Head to the company canteen for a lackluster lunch: cold, gray, overcooked cauliflower, weird chicken breast, and watery rice pudding. I can't bring myself to pay out of pocket for something else right now; maybe that'll change if I secure the $20,000 raise I'm after in the next three months. 5 p.m. \u2014 My neck is killing me, and I need to get up and walk around. I'm also hungry \u2014 another sugar low. I grab vanilla flan (which is sadly tiny, like three ounces) from the caf\u00e9 downstairs and use my members' card for a discount.  $1.20 6:15 p.m. \u2014 Right before I leave work, I take care of Amazon orders that are being delivered to my parents' home for pickup over the holidays. I get biodegradable poop bags for the pup (they aren't a thing here in Barcelona, so I order 270), pure pine incense (no artificial stuff), and two plush dog toys for her to play with over the holidays. I take advantage of the exchange rate, which is in my favor.  $39.81 Advertisement 7:30 p.m. \u2014 I meet an ex-colleague and friend at a bar near my house, dog in tow. It's cozy and warm inside, and I order a glass of tempranillo while I wait. We end up having another glass, and two tapas, Mah\u00f3n cheese with membrillo (quince paste) and olives, and pan cristal. I coached him through getting a new job offer recently, which raised his pay 80%, so he treats me \u2014 and reveals that a baby is on the way. 9:30 p.m. \u2014 Boyfriend meets me at home and eats leftovers. He bought fresh chestnuts, and we cook them in a cast-iron pan; it's one of our favorite winter activities. We've been debating breaking up for two months, and tonight we end up getting into an argument. We've been together a year and a half, and he moved out of my place six weeks ago. Since then, we've been trying to patch it up. He goes home, and I'm actually pretty happy to have my place to myself. I curl up with the dog and breathe because I'll be able to sleep in a little tomorrow; I've negotiated starting at noon on Thursdays. I'm thinking of hitting up boxing and yoga, but I'll probably end up sleeping. I'm asleep by 11:30. Daily Total: $41.01", "day_four": "Day Four: 9 a.m. \u2014 I hit snooze from 8 a.m. onwards, and finally rise at 9 because a friend I usually meet at my favorite coffee shop is almost there. I get ready fast and take the pup out to meet my friend. I've prepaid for coffee already, and enjoy a flat white while chatting. Advertisement 12 p.m. \u2014 I decide to work from home today. I shouldn't, but I really need a day without two hours on the train, and my boss is in Madrid. I take the opportunity to run errands around the neighborhood and pick up panettone for the weekend from a nice bakery ($30). When I get home, I order new linen sheets from Latvia on Etsy ($214.97) because my bottom sheet is totally full of holes. I also get two containers of cocoa-lavender dry shampoo ($34.50 for two) from my favorite Etsy store, which I ship home to the States. The two containers will last me most of next year.  $279.47 2 p.m. \u2014 I make leftovers for lunch, and I'm happy to not be at the company cafeteria. Orange-cinnamon pulled pork, carrots, and cabbage, along with a plain yogurt. I see that my paycheck came through, so I pay my rent on my phone. 5:30 p.m. \u2014 I gave the dog walker the day off because I'm home today, even though I pay him in-full at the beginning of each month. I take the pup out again and swing by my waxing place to make an appointment for later in the month, then stop at the restaurant where my company is dining tomorrow for our holiday dinner. I want to make sure all the details are buttoned up, but no one is there yet. 7:30 p.m. \u2014 I get a facial and a 30-minute neck-and-shoulder massage at my social club and gym ($165). I need it badly and don't feel bad about treating myself because last month I lived on about \u20ac400 due to a big tax payment that was due. My work operates on a Spanish schedule of 14 payments per year, so I'll receive two paychecks this month and all will be fine. I'd prefer the cash every month because I lose the opportunity to invest it this way, but as they say in Spanish, \"es lo que hay.\"  $165 Advertisement 10 p.m. \u2014 That was so what I needed; my esthetician is awesome, tiny, and French, and she gave me an incredible drainage massage of the face and neck. I'm home and not hungry so I wash my hair, water the dog, and hit the hay. Fridays start extra early here, as most companies do an intensive schedule \u2014 8 a.m. to 3 p.m. \u2014 so it's important that I get to sleep early. Plus, tomorrow is our company holiday dinner! Daily Total: $444.47", "day_five": "Day Five: 6:45 a.m. \u2014 I slept well! Could use more, but my shoulders and neck feel way better. I'm up, dressed and out with the dog. It's cold! I make a mental note to grab gloves for my commute. I bike to the train. 7:45 a.m. \u2014 I buy a new three-month train pass since the old one expired. It's the first of the month, I haven't even paid my dog walker yet, and my account is below \u20ac1,000. I planned it that way until my extra salary payment comes in this month, but it still stresses me out. 11 a.m. \u2014 There's leftover carrot cake from someone's birthday yesterday, so I grab half a slice. I drank two coffees earlier this morning and ate the rest of my yogurt and jam. Maybe I'll eat yogurt next week, too, and save the \u20ac1.35/day I usually spend on a palmier half-dipped in chocolate. A few minutes later, I'm still hungry so I grab chicken curry with rice from the prepared food shop downstairs; no lunch is provided on Fridays since we work a short day.  $2.50 Advertisement 2 p.m. \u2014 My back and neck are killing me again, so I hole up in a conference room with a high table to change it up. Only an hour or so left, and I have my afternoon free; then, later, there's the company dinner in my neighborhood. (I volunteered to help organize it this year so that I could ensure dinner was near my home.) I check on my dog using the webcam; she hasn't moved. My boyfriend promised to take my pup out for another walk around 11 but never showed up. It's typical for him to be late. When I ask him if he's getting her or not, he starts a fight with me. I ask him if he'll be home later so that I can get my keys back. He insists on dropping them off at my house instead, now. I think it's really over. 4 p.m. \u2014 I get home and clean the house. I feel really tired and hope the dinner tonight energizes me. I had too many carbs this afternoon while cleaning \u2014 a piece of fresh bread and two candied chestnuts I picked up at an Italian specialty shop on the way home \u2014 and I'm now in a sugar low. Wish I had time to work out.  $7.13 8 p.m. \u2014 One of my employees swings by my place on her way to the restaurant, and we walk over together. I bring a great bottle of wine I've been saving from from a small winery in California and crack it open for the early-comers, my CEO included. It's a nice cocktail hour, and we don't end up sitting down until 9:30 for dinner because some key people are running on Spanish time. Right before the main course, I zip out to my house (four minutes away) and grab my dog to join us. She is a total ham and works the room like a pro! Advertisement 2 a.m. \u2014 That was such a great night! People loved the restaurant I suggested, and the staff did an amazing job of taking care of nearly 30 people at once. It was really special. Two people ducked out early, but everyone else stayed until 1:30, at least! Pup is exhausted. I'm pretty hammered, but I still manage to take my makeup off before slipping into bed. Daily Total: $9.63", "day_six": "Day Six: 10:30 a.m. \u2014 I'm awake, but the dog is not. I rouse her because we have a vet appointment today to check on her injured knee and take care of other small things. I grab a flat white on the way ($2.70) from a new caf\u00e9 around the corner I hadn't tried yet. My favorite coffee place is closed on the weekends, so it's a good opportunity. At the vet, we have the exam ($17.80); she's healing well, but needs two more weeks of rest. I pick up her preventative monthly meds ($41.60).  $62.10 1 p.m. \u2014 A hangover is really setting in, but the market closes at 3 today and won't be open tomorrow, so I head out to pick up the week's groceries. I drop my recycling in the bins and pick up cash to pay my dog walker for this month. (Less than normal, $135 this month, since we're traveling some and have some bank holidays.) At the market, I pick up a whole chicken ($11.84); a piece of organic steak to use in a vegetable stir fry ($9.50); eggs ($2.85 for six); a small piece of goat cheese ($2.21), and plain yogurt ($2.08 for four). I already have all the veggies I need at home from my bimonthly farm box that arrived last week, which is usually \u20ac26 or about $30.  $28.48 Advertisement 3 p.m. \u2014 In a moment of weakness, I take the pup and get a burger from a good spot nearby. My hangover is demanding it. Thankfully, it's fairly easy to find a good hamburger in Barcelona, while I can't say the same for the rest of Europe. The line is horrendous, but they know me and sneak my order through the pickup line. I take it home to eat and get ready to meet a friend in another neighborhood.  $10.10 4 p.m. \u2014 I grab my bike and cruise to the neighborhood of Sant Antoni to meet a friend I haven't seen in a while. We get a tea ($1.78) and chat, and make our way to an artisanal fermentation shop that opened recently. I buy lacto-fermented veggies, their house \"live\" olive mix, and a big kombucha to sip on this week ($30.05). My stomach has been really weird and bloated lately, and I'm trying to incorporate living foods into my diet again. I used to make the stuff myself when I lived in San Francisco but don't have a good set up for it in my tiny kitchen.  $31.83 7:30 p.m. \u2014 A friend pops over before an \"Eat Art\" dinner she's going to nearby. I'm still off alcohol and on kombucha. I make my friend a vermouth with live olives, and we chat for an hour about our recent breakups. I'm exhausted, and when she leaves I take the pup for a final evening walk and am in bed by 9:30. It takes forever to fall asleep because my central heater broke on Friday, and the space heater isn't cutting it. Landlord says he's on it Monday morning.

We head to the park, and I let her sniff everything since she still can't go off leash or run; vet's orders. After half an hour, we make our way to the best bakery around, and I have a caf\u00e9 con leche and a mascarpone croissant. As I pay, I see several missed calls from my ex. I call him on my way home, and he asks to see me. I agree to meet him mid-afternoon to walk the dog, so he can visit with her, and we can avoid being in my house.  $4.75 11 a.m. \u2014 Time to cook for the week! My friend E. pops over with ingredients I've forgotten, and refuses to let me pay for them. We make chicken tikka masala, chicken stock (which I freeze to use later for soups, risotto, polenta, etc.), and a beef-veggie stir fry. We eat some of the stir fry, take the dog for a walk, and pick up dessert while we're out (tiramisu and carrot cake, \u20ac3 each). She pays and leaves around 1. I send her home with a portion of the chicken tikka masala. 2 p.m. \u2014 Pup and I head out to meet the ex for a walk. It's a hard couple of hours, and we almost walk away from each other a few times. I don't typically argue, but he has really brought it out in me. He is Portuguese, and there are definitely differences in our communication. On the way back towards the neighborhood, we each buy pizzetta at a new Italian place that opened on my street. The pizzetta is okay and gives me the carbs I was craving after a beef-and-veggie only lunch. We part ways with a hug, but he's been crying off and on. I always loved that about him \u2014 that he's never been afraid to let his emotions surface. I never met his mom, but I imagine she's a good woman. I head home around 4 and snuggle the pup, trying to get warm.  $1.18 Advertisement 7:15 p.m. \u2014 Ex texts me and asks if he can stop by the house a few minutes. I think about it for a while and eventually agree, with the stipulation that if he gets angry or upset, he has to take a walk immediately, and that he needs to bring over a space heater to help warm my place up. He shows up around 8, and I make pasta puttanesca with groceries I already have: good quality spaghetti, the last of the jarred fancy tuna from my company's Christmas basket gift, the last of the anchovies, the last of the capers, and the last of the tomato paste. There's more crying, but we part on good terms and he seems to have more clarity now. I'm his first girlfriend ever, and he's 30, so I find myself having to be pretty clear about what I expect to be different moving forward. 10:30 p.m. \u2014 Ex leaves and takes the cozy heater with him.

Usually, I'm not a morning person, but I slept fitfully, aware of a big, looming morning deadline looming. Now, it's go, go, go.

I'm mostly okay with my decision, but a 20-minute walk still feels long on New Yorker time. 11:30 a.m. \u2014 The first thing I do when I get to the office is find an empty room and call a senior manager I recently worked with. She complained to my boss about a slip-up on my team and considers me responsible, so here I am, steeling myself for an \"adult\" conversation. She warms up once she realizes this is an  I'm sorry, let's fix this  call, not a  Here are all my excuses  call. Another sigh of relief for the day. 12 p.m. \u2014 For the rest of the work day, I attend an internal workshop on cannabis banking and legislation (consulting's latest \"green field,\" pun intended). A pre-workshop lunch is provided, which is great since I forgot breakfast; I eat half of a sliced pork and apple sandwich before losing interest, and drink my watery mocha latte. The discussion is brisk and fascinating, and the audience is one of the most demographically diverse I've seen in my firm. Color me impressed. 6:30 p.m. \u2014 The workshop ends with a drinks reception. I help myself to a half glass of wine and a few prosciutto-wrapped dates before leaving, and then swing by Zara on my way to the subway.

Decide to pull myself out of the flow to get personal work done, mainly because it's my only free weeknight this week, thus, my only night for adulting. I make myself a Dark and Stormy, text my sister, eat a pita pocket filled with hummus and half an avocado, and prep salads for the next two lunches: kale, baked chicken strips, avocado, and beets.

Good thing I had my work outfit laid out. 8:42 a.m. \u2014 Grab an Uber to the subway and jump on the express train; expense it to work. I could technically expense an Uber straight to the office today (I'm guest-presenting to a global working group) but experience has shown me that the express subway is more reliable than morning traffic in midtown.

I make a coffee (hazelnut creamer, yesss) and find a granola bar in the depths of my bag. 9:30 a.m. \u2014 Showtime. My presentation goes over well, and I'm invited to join the next working session as an internal advisor for a workshops series they're creating. I'm excited but can't say yes until I run it back up my leadership chain. Working on a global team means lots of bureaucracy over what is a strategic use of my time. 12:30 p.m. \u2014 I am tempted by the pierogis in the office caf\u00e9, but I have my packed salad for lunch. I nurse a second, and then third coffee from the pantry over team meetings and calls for the rest of the day. 6:30 p.m. \u2014 A senior manager (and very good friend) from out of town is here on business, so we go out for dinner at a Thai restaurant with a group of colleagues. We share a ton of appetizers, and I pack half of my huge plate of delicious, basil chicken fried rice to-go. A handful of us move on to a nearby bar, where the Hall & Oates song \"I Can't Go For That (No Can Do)\" inspires a fascinating (and NSFW) conversation on personal boundaries. The senior manager picks up both tabs. 1:50 a.m. \u2014 Share an Uber home with my colleague, who's crashing on my couch so she doesn't have to trek back to New Jersey.

We dress speedily, and I wash down milk thistle with lemon water in light of the drinking we did the night before. On the way to the subway, we get lattes and pastries at a hipster caf\u00e9. I suggest we use this commute time for our mentoring check-in, which gives us time to get back later in the day and allows me to expense breakfast. ($12.50 expensed) 2:30 p.m. \u2014 It's a full-on day with back-to-back working sessions, planning workshops in Brussels, Zurich, and Montana. I usually travel twice a month to deliver these sessions, so when I'm back in the city like I am now, all of my time is spent planning for the next round. I eat my Thai leftovers for lunch during a conference call. 4:30 p.m. \u2014 After some internal debate, I text N. to ask if he's free later that week to hang out. We had a great first date a few weeks ago, then he went on holiday, and we both got wrapped up in respective Thanksgiving plans. We really hit it off, but I don't want to build my hopes up. I definitely have a list of men who've ghosted after, and despite, fantastic first dates. While my New Yorker friends assure me this is common, it's still baffling. You agreed we had a great time! You proactively asked to meet again! And then when faced with the actual planning ... silence. Aziz, write a sequel and break it down for a sister. Advertisement 7:30 p.m. \u2014 Meet my friend for a quick bite at a nearby diner (his office is just a block away) before we head to a concert. Unfortunately, the Christmas tourist crowds have hijacked most restaurants. It takes forever to get a server's attention but the food comes super fast, which makes up for it. We split a burger, have a beer each, and catch up. My fatigue is definitely setting in, but my friend \u2014 a master of puns \u2014 gets me laughing, and I get a second wind of energy. We usually take turns paying so he picks up this tab, knowing I'll get drinks at the concert. Hop the subway together to Brooklyn. 9:15 p.m. \u2014 I get us beers, and we catch part of the opening act (a fantastic Bibi Bourelly) before Jacob Banks gets on stage. It's an intimate but danceable gig, marred only by an annoying couple in front of us that can't decide whether to make out or dance with abandon; either way, they keep blocking our view!

I make a cup of pumpkin spice tea, and eat some chia seed pudding with almond milk and turmeric. Like the lemon water, I've found it helpful to constantly maintain a jar of this in the fridge and top up when it's low. I mentally prepare myself for three hours of conference calls, all of which I'm leading. Advertisement 1:30 p.m. \u2014 Break for a homemade salad of kale, roast chicken strips, almond slices, sliced apples, and roasted sesame dressing. 4 p.m. \u2014 Still hungry, so I snack on black sesame ice cream. I'd hoped to go to an afternoon yoga class but my inbox is seething with things that need a response before end of day. This is the primary reason I don't work out enough. 5:30 p.m. \u2014 Close my laptop for the day! Take a leisurely stroll to a South African restaurant in the neighborhood near mine, and meet a friend for a quick, pre-theater bite. The menu has lots of interesting dishes I try to work through each time I visit, so we split an appetizer and grab a drink.  $23 6:45 p.m. \u2014 Brisk walk to the playhouse. My friend stops dead in his tracks and doubles over when I mention that the version of  The Fountainhead  we're watching is four-hours long ... and in Dutch. Turns out, I forgot to mention those key details. This was a birthday gift to him (he prefers experiences to objects), and now I worry it was a bad choice. It turns out to be riveting! Even though there's an intermission to break up the four hours, I get extremely fidgety in the last 20 minutes. 11:30 p.m. \u2014 We meet up with other friends who were also at the play and eat a late dinner in the area. We order oysters and cocktails and debrief about the play; none of us can remember the last time we dedicated four consecutive hours to an endeavor, let alone sat still for four hours. Midway through our meal, the cast walks in and we applaud. They still have a few nights to go and must be exhausted.  $46.78 Advertisement 1:15 a.m. \u2014 After all that sitting down, I decide to walk back home while the others grab cabs. One friend joins me for part of the route, then jumps on a Citi Bike. I love the peacefulness of walking home alone.

I usually don't come in on weekends, but my boss is heading to Zurich and needs me to print and prep materials. I have dinner plans in Midtown East anyway so this is basically a free, fast trip into the city. ($18.71 expensed) 3:40 p.m. \u2014 Oh my god, I forgot about holiday crowds. Traffic is diverted, some streets are pedestrian only, and I totally underestimated the throngs of tourists clamoring for a glimpse of the tree at Rockefeller Center. Getting to the office is an exercise in patience. Advertisement 4:45 p.m. \u2014 Take the subway then walk to my friend's apartment. She's an aspiring chef who runs monthly supper clubs in her one-bedroom apartment, and tonight is the first time we're co-hosting an informal storytelling supper club. The premise is simple: She cooks; I facilitate; everyone brings their own story, and it's BYOB drinks. I help with food prep and run out to Trader Joe's to get ginger beer for a large pitcher of Moscow Mules. While there, I pick up cannoli, Christmas cookies, chocolate oranges, beet crackers, and sausages for my week ahead.  $27.45 7:45 p.m. \u2014 Our friends start to arrive and pour themselves drinks; someone even brought all the ingredients to make Negronis! I kick off the night with improv storytelling, share ground rules (basic things like, \"Don't be judgmental.\"), and we're off! Over the first course, I share my story; over the courses that follow, I fish names out of a bowl and invite that person to share their story. We're seven people in total and the conversation spans Scientology, travel snafus, Burning Man, moonshine, tipping etiquette, and the Singularity. Everything is themed around \"the first time\" (since this entire night is a pilot), and my friend also cooks dishes she's never made before, including wild venison in lettuce cups, minced buffalo with Szechuan peppers, broiled sea bass, Indian carrot salad, and roast quail. 1:15 a.m. \u2014 We finish with cannoli and a bottle of cava, feeling pretty pleased that the storytelling supper club construct worked! We already have ideas brewing for the next one. Advertisement 1:35 a.m. \u2014 I'm ready to call it a night after several consecutive late nights, but one of my friends at dinner convinces me (begs, really) to be his wing woman. He has a crush on a good friend of mine, L., who couldn't make it to dinner but is up for a nightcap. I'm already seeing her for brunch tomorrow, but he's like a brother to me, and the bar is somewhat close to home, so I consider it a favor. We jump in a Lyft Line; he pays. 2 a.m. \u2014 We sit at the bar and realize that it's the fourth weekend in a row we've all hung out \u2014 mainly because not having to travel for the past five weeks means I've been available to hang out. This kind of uninterrupted stretch only happens twice a year and I have to really push for it. It took weeks of repeatedly voicing my recent work fatigue and \"brownout\" before my boss agreed that I could focus on remote projects for the last month. 3:19 a.m. \u2014 Two drinks later, I jump in an Uber home while my friend walks L. home; wink, wink.

Advertisement 12:25 p.m. \u2014 Cross the road, literally, to brunch. I order a fried chicken sandwich and coffee, and L. orders mac and cheese and a Bloody Mary and proceeds to spill on the night before. I pass on some of the more intimate details \u2014 he's my friend, after all \u2014 but hey, at least someone's making progress. N. still hasn't texted me back, and L. agrees that I shouldn't text again, even if the instinct to get passive aggressive is floating right below the surface. We chat about the ex she's meeting with to clear the air, and decide that I'll accompany her to an apartment viewing later. I get half my chicken sandwich to go and a few spoonfuls of her mac and cheese. She pays, and I immediately Venmo her.  $30 1:45 p.m. \u2014 L.'s ex shows up so I make a graceful exit. I walk to the bank to withdraw cash, and then head to a nail salon, only to end up making an appointment since they're full. On my walk home, I drop into a random boutique and walk out with a Christmas present for my best friend.  $25 3:15 p.m. \u2014 L. meets me in in front of my building, and we walk a few blocks to the apartment viewing. With the pending L train shutdown, she's exploring other neighborhoods; it would be great to have a girl friend so close. The viewing reminds me that I should definitely be paying less in rent... Advertisement 3:45 p.m. \u2014 I want to hear how the conversation with her ex went, so we get coffee and cake at a charming caf\u00e9 we passed on the way to the viewing. We marvel at emotionally mature men, and the ones that get away.  $16 4:30 p.m. \u2014 Leg it to my mani-pedi appointment, where I switch my phone off and read  Here  (the magazine by Away) cover to cover. I bought myself Away luggage for my birthday last month and it was worth every penny.  $55 6:30 p.m. \u2014 Much needed night in. I water my plants, pack for my work trip to Dallas, and do a round of laundry.

It's a random holiday in France today so I get to spend it with her. I get a quick workout in before she arrives and greet her as her Uber gets to my apartment. We take the metro into Le Marais and get some French bread in her system. We split a cheese and meats plate (yes, we're well aware it's only 10:30 a.m., but it was on the petit dejeuner menu so I don't feel weird ordering it), pain perdu (a.k.a. French toast, which was to die for), a baguette with jam and butter, and I can't not order a cappuccino. I've been in Paris for a month now, and it was the perfect time to get a dose of my closest friend from home.  $17.78 12:30 p.m. \u2014 After brunch, we walk around Le Marais and head to the Picasso Museum. Luckily for me, I have dual citizenship \u2014 American and French \u2014 and since I'm still under 26 with an EU passport I get all the perks of the free museums. Unluckily for my friend, she still has to pay. Advertisement 3 p.m. \u2014 My friend was battling a virus the week before. With the jet lag and no sleep on the plane, she's starting to wear down. We stop at a caf\u00e9 and order espressos and French onion soup, because of course. Funnily enough, we spot another friend from New York walking by the restaurant who is also visiting this week. We stop and chat. I get to expense this because I get a \u20ac150 stipend a week from my job as part of my three-month exchange in Paris. ($16.60 expensed) 4 p.m. \u2014 We stop into a boutique that has gently-worn designer clothes for less money. I end up trying on a navy Maje skirt that still has the tag on it and is grossly marked down, despite no one wearing it. I love these stores. I also have a weakness for anything navy. It's cash only and luckily I have the exact amount. My friend contemplates buying a lightly-worn Alexander McQueen sleeveless leather jacket, but I advise her that she could probably find something similar for a lot less elsewhere. She passes, but still thinks about the jacket later.  $55 4:30 p.m. \u2014 Directly next door is another designer, gently-used store. I know I'm in trouble as soon as I walk in. I've been searching for a shearling coat for years and find one for only \u20ac200. My friend deliberates between a cheetah coat, a long, suede, trench-like coat, and an emerald green peacoat. She has an eclectic, but amazing sense of style. I end up finding another coat that is much more practical \u2014 a winter puffer by Patagonia. And it's in navy. Although I bought a coat this weekend, I kept the tags on because I wasn't sure of it. In the end, I rationalize that since the shearling and Patagonia coats together are the same price as the one I bought a few days ago, I will return the other one. Score! Two coats for the price of one, and the shearling is very unique. My friend ends up buying the cheetah coat, and naturally I feel less guilty.  $408.02 Advertisement 6:30 p.m. \u2014 With our wallets in mourning, we opt to do a casual dinner at home tonight. Being in Paris, I have three different cheeses left in my fridge and grapes. We opt to buy a baguette, a dip, prosciutto, and a pastry and almond croissant to split.

Post workout, I head home, shower, change and eat petit-suisse yogurt (THE BEST) with strawberry jam and a glass of OJ. I head out for work as my friend gets ready, awaiting our other friend who is arriving soon. 12:30 p.m. \u2014 I have a lunch with someone I met this morning by the espresso machine. She seems nice and is here for an internship. My friend from work comes along with us. I buy a lentil salad and yogurt for dessert, resisting any of the other tempting delicious desserts. It seems like Paris' biggest meal is always lunch. People typically have a soup, sandwich, and dessert \u2014 very different from my Chopt/Sweetgreen salad life back in NYC. I fully embrace it, except for today since I'm anticipating the big dinner I'll have later with my friends.

I've been wanting to try this place, as it was on many of my friends' lists, but it's walk-in only. As I arrive, my friends are bickering about how they have different tastes on the wine. They rely on me to pick a bottle. We end up with something we all like. Phew. We're big splitters, so we split the burrata with caraway seeds, foie gras, pappardelle with lamb, and a cheese plate. Everything is divine. We split another bottle of wine between the two of us; it's Thursday after all and I feel like celebrating that they're here. We end up debating about whether to get just one or two desserts, but I force them to get two: a pear ice cream crumble (the waitress said was her favorite) and a decadent chocolate cake. YUM. Probably didn't need the secnd bottle of wine, or the second dessert for that matter, but c'est la vie?  $73.63 11:15 p.m. \u2014 We head home on the metro and get ready for bed.

It's nice to hang out with them and we discuss office gossip and our plans are for the weekend. I get to expense it as part of my weekly stipend while working here. ($16.37 expensed) 5:15 p.m. \u2014 I checked out some new online shopping websites. I found an awesome pair of sneakers for $55, and an oversized denim jacket I've been eager to lock down for only $30. Definitely don't need either, but they're a good deal so I decide to go for it anyways. During checkout I realize it only ships to the U.S. I think of them as a welcome-back gift to myself for when I return to New York after my exchange. I tend to rationalize purchases like these in this manner. At least I'm not paying rent for these three months.  $85.80 6:15 p.m. \u2014 Meet my friends back at my apartment and we decide to chill for a bit before our dinner reservation instead of hitting up a happy hour. After getting ready, we take the metro around 8:45 p.m. and stop at a cool speakeasy-type of cocktail bar across the street from the restaurant. Each drink is crafty, and costs \u20ac16 each. My friend pays as a treat. They taste like spa water in the best way possible. We chat for a bit and then head across the street for our reservation.  $1.80 Advertisement 10:30 p.m. \u2014 This is going to be more of our \"bourgie\" dinner. This spot is supposed to be quite chic and the upstairs turns into a club. We split the burrata (no other appetizer catches our eye), the steak frites for two, and the mushroom truffle ravioli along with one bottle of wine this time. The food wasn't great and the ambiance actually reminded me a lot of a place in NYC, but we still have a great time. Our waiter is a hilarious man who makes our experience extra lovely. We check out the upstairs after din, but decide to ditch for a more local spot as it's not as \"lit\" as we were expecting.  $59.69 12:30 a.m. \u2014 We get to one of my favorite spots from studying abroad in Paris that hasn't changed for decades. It's a restaurant upstairs and an old wine cave downstairs with great music. It tends to get a bit hot down there without any air circulation, but never disappoints. I order us each a drink and my friends both Venmo me back. Unfortunately, it's closing at 2 a.m., so we don't have much time to people-watch and dance. We have a big day ahead of us tomorrow and decide to call it quits when it closes.

Before ordering the Uber, we stop at a boulangerie across the street and get treats \u2014 pain d'amandes au chocolat for me. My friend pays since she's trying to get rid of her cash. I order the Uber and my friends Venmo me for their share.  $11.50 Advertisement 1 p.m. \u2014 Museum entrance is free for me; love these under-26 passport perks! We decide to start with the gardens and then the chateau since the weather doesn't look too promising. My friend and I stop and take a picture with each statue, and pose just like it. We think we're funny. People are staring, but I think they think we're funny, too. The gardens are absolutely beautiful with the season's colors starting to change. We continue towards the domain of Marie Antoinette; this place is HUGE. 3 p.m. \u2014 We stop at Angelina's inside the Chateau grounds because I refuse to have my friends leave Paris without having one of Angelina's famous hot chocolates. Seriously, if you come to Paris and you don't get this hot chocolate, shame on you. It's literally chocolate bars melted. Insane. We each get a hot chocolate and a sandwich, and I split a dessert with my friend because I have zero willpower and pretend that everything in Europe is made with better quality ingredients and therefore is good for me. I still kinda believe this is true.  $15.32 4:30 p.m. \u2014 Halfway through the tour of the castle, we stop at Ladur\u00e9e and get macarons. My friend is enamored by them and he says it's his treat, so I can't resist despite still being full from the hot chocolate earlier. We each take a bite of each one and end up scarfing down the whole box in probably two minutes or less. The cashier looks at us half laughing, half filled with scorn, and probably screaming,  typical Americans , in her head as she watches. Oh well. Advertisement 6 p.m. \u2014 We are literally closing down Versailles. No, seriously: Security guards are yelling at us to leave as we take pictures we  must  post on our Instagrams later. We get the shots and finally get going. We choose to train/subway back to Paris for our dinner reservation. We each buy our respective train tickets and are exhausted. We reviewing the photos we took, trying to cackle silently as to not disturb any Parisians on the train and be rude.  $4.27 7 p.m. \u2014 I had made us a different dinner reservation, but my friend hasn't had his dose of French onion soup yet, and I'm scared the bourgie restaurant won't have it, despite having a cool view of the Eiffel Tower. We opt to go to the Montmartre area, which is very cultural and filled with local artists, to get a more classic French meal. We each order the appetizer, entree, and dessert prix fixe, plus a bottle of white wine the waitress recommends and cheese fondue as our entrees. DIVINE. We each test our respective appetizers: escargot, a salad with jambon, and of course, the French onion soup. We also taste each others' desserts: crepe a nutella, creme brulee, and a tarte tatin. All amazing. After dinner, we stop by the Sacre Coeur and peep inside the beautiful old church. We head home on the subway since my friends leave early tomorrow morning.  $39 Daily Total: $70.09", "day_five": "Day Five: 6 a.m. \u2014 My friends leave and I roll around in bed as I hear them get ready to call the Uber. I say goodbye half-asleep and get back into bed and set an alarm for 11 a.m. I'm meeting old family friends in the outskirts of Paris at 1 p.m. for lunch. Advertisement 11 a.m. \u2014 Alarm goes off. I swear I could've slept for five more hours. Entertaining your friends nonstop is tiring, but worth it! I get ready and take the bus/RER out to St. Geramin-en-Laye where I apparently I used to hang out a lot at as a two year old, but it doesn't spark my memory much. I have to buy more Metro/bus tickets along with the RER pass, and I opt for the 10-metro ticket deal, which gives you a free ticket.  $23.38 12:40 p.m. \u2014 I arrive in St. Germain-en-Laye, see a Starbucks and am dying for a coffee. I already feel guilty going into a Starbucks knowing how much I'm about to spend on a cappuccino, but they have soy milk and I don't want to be tired and rude at the lunch, so I splurge. I can't believe it's nearly $7 (with the conversion rate) for a TALL cappuccino. I declare this robbery and vow to never go to another Starbucks in Europe again. I arrive a bit early for lunch, so I walk around the old castle grounds before heading to the restaurant. I love how Europe just has casual castles standing around.  $6.61 1 p.m. \u2014 I was a bit nervous I wouldn't be able to recognize my family friends as I haven't seen them in a solid 10 years, but they are luckily entering as soon as I do, and I semi-recognize one of them. Not as awkward as I expected! We talk in French the whole time, as I prefer to do this whenever I have a choice, even if they do speak English. I'm practically fluent, thanks to my French mom, but I still want to perfect it whenever I can. We have plenty to catch up on and they both work in my industry so it's nice to hear their points of view. They end up treating me to lunch, which is nice for my wallet after the past few days. I head back to Paris around 3:30 p.m. taking the RER/bus again. Advertisement 4 p.m. \u2014 Once I get off the bus, I stop at a Monoprix to pick up laundry detergent and a few things to eat for the week. I plan to expense it since I have my weekly stipend. I get laundry detergent, softener, ham, authentic Italian-looking pasta (instead of the typical packaged stuff), and gruyere. ($28.20 expensed) 4:35 p.m. \u2014 I get home, throw a load of laundry in filled with all the towels we used the past few days, and listen to the  Jimmy Fallon Live  episode of Jennifer Lawrence interviewing Kim Kardashian. It's hilarious! I promised myself earlier I'd go out for a bike ride after everything I indulged in with my friends visiting. I realize I only have an hour until sundown. I throw my gym clothes on and hop on a Velib, the Paris bike rental program, and head towards the park. It's not SoulCycle class, but I got a membership for only \u20ac30 for the entire year before I arrived (it was the reduced price because I'm under 26). It's crazy how much cheaper things are in Europe, especially for those under 26. I thought CitiBike's for $163/year was a good deal in New York! 5:40 p.m. \u2014 The bike ride was lovely and energized me. I love this time alone, while still getting to enjoy the outdoors. I get home right as it's getting dark, shower, and cook up the pasta with the ingredients I bought earlier, adding in pesto from my fridge for added flavor. I'm exhausted and get to sleep by 10 p.m. after watching  Real Housewives of Dallas  and  O.C.  These shows are my guilty pleasure to the max!

I get ready for work, eat my usual yogurt with strawberry jam, and head out. I stop and chat with my super for a bit, who compliments me on my shearling coat. At least someone's noticing my new purchases! 12:15 p.m. \u2014 Since I live so close to the office, I like to have one day where I head home and eat in the comfort of my own home. I contemplate eating my leftover pasta for lunch, but am craving a soup so I stop off at the grab-and-go spot next door. I get a potato and leek soup, a small side salad with mini-shrimp and avocado, and of course, a piece of baguette as is tradition in France. You simply cannot eat a meal without bread! It comes out to $9 and change, but I will expense it with my stipend later. I eat the soup and in the end, also eat the leftover pasta. I save the side salad for tonight's dinner, as I'll get home late after ballet. I finish up the last 20 minutes of the documentary I was watching the other day and head back to work. ($9.24 expensed) 6:40 p.m. \u2014 I leave work and head home. I've been craving a dance class, as I used to do ballet for the majority of my life. I researched a place where classes are only \u20ac15 and it looks pretty decent. I stop and talk to my super again, and he says he has a present for me. He's cute and young and I haven't been able to tell if we are flirting with each other until this moment; he gives me a gift of a pink ribbon. I have no idea what this means, but am curious and thank him. I munch on eggplant dip I have so I'm not starving by the time I get back from dance. I get ready and hop on a Velib to cut down on walking time to the studio. Advertisement 7:30 p.m. \u2014 Shoot! I get to the Velib station near the studio and there are no spots left to drop my bike off. Panicked I'll be late for ballet class, I try to search for another Velib spot nearby on Google. Luckily, someone comes by two minutes later and takes a bike out so I'm not late for class. I get into the dance studio and the teacher is super nice; we emailed before so she remembered me and I pay for the class. I was worried I was a bit out of shape for the advanced class, but to my surprise I still got it! The teacher was fantastic. I'll definitely be coming back.  $17 9:30 p.m. \u2014 I choose to walk home this time, about a 20-minute walk so that I don't have to deal with not having any open spots to park the Velib. I stop into a store to grab water as I'm dying of thirst after the ballet class. Each stride I take makes me note how sore I will be tomorrow. When I get home, I eat the side salad and have a spoonful of Nutella so I can't complain about being hungry if I wake up in the middle of the night. I watch some Netflix and swipe on Bumble and Happn. I've gotta say, the dating scene and these apps are much more successful for me in New York. It's probably the culture difference, but every time someone messages me some weird slang I don't understand, I deem them as being creepy and never respond. I end up passing out around 11:30 p.m. without much hope for finding a French lover during my short time here.  $1 Advertisement Daily Total: $18", "day_seven": "Day Seven: 8:15 a.m. \u2014 Alarm goes off and I'm feeling very drowsy. I attribute this to leaving my heat on high all night and drying me out. I better not get sick again. I was sick two weeks ago! I eat my typical yogurt and strawberry jam with a glass of OJ. I never get sick of yogurt that tastes this good. 11:45 a.m. \u2014 At lunchtime, I have two back-to-back calls for the global millennial core group I'm a member of at my company, so I decide to run out and get something to eat at my desk during the calls. I can expense this with my stipend. I get the special of the day, which is salmon and mashed potatoes with some sort of green sauce I can't figure out. Because it's a French lunch, the offer also comes with a small carrot-apple fresh-pressed juice and an apple crumble dessert. Nom. ($14 expensed) 4 p.m. \u2014 I'm WhatsApping with my mom and semi-harassing her to give me a definite date she wants to leave to see my grandmother for Christmas, before prices get outrageous. She'll be coming to Paris before and then we will take the train to my grandma's together. I finally get her to choose and she says if I get the train tickets for the both of us online, she will reimburse me as a Christmas gift. I was expecting to have to pay for my ticket myself which would have been about $85 for my part, so I'm a bit relieved, especially after the shopping splurges last week and my friends being in town. ($205 expensed) Advertisement 6:15 p.m. \u2014 I stop by Monoprix and pick up a few things I need: two hand creams (one for my purse, one for my apartment), body wash, and hair ties. I will use my stipend money and expense this later. I head home and despite still feeling drowsy and sore AF from ballet last night, I force myself to hit the gym. I try out a Kayla workout after a 15-minute cardio warm-up. Damn that was hard! Her Bikini Body Guide is no joke and makes me reminisce on how dependent I am on Equinox classes to force me to work hard, and how much I miss their classes. ($16 expensed) 8:30 p.m. \u2014 I get home, shower, and make dinner: chicken and green beans. Back to being healthy and on a budget. Le sigh. My body and wallet desperately need this, I remind myself. I crawl into bed and watch Bravo before calling it bedtime around 11 p.m. I'm a huge sleeper and this past week has taken its toll on me. No wonder I felt a bit sick this morning. If I don't get an average of eight hours minimum a night at least four times a week, I really feel it.

Our lawyers have asked that my team complete a review of a legal document before 10 a.m., having only provided it at 5 p.m. on Saturday night. I do this and a few other things. I'm in the middle of a deal, and it will make my life for the coming week so much easier if I just do it now. I drink three espressos, three glasses of water and a vitamin D tablet (which I do every morning as per NHS guidelines!). 10 a.m. \u2014 I catch the bus into the city to meet my friend for brunch at Soho House. On the way, I see a large suitcase completely alone on the side of the street, just near Oxford Circus. This has genuinely never happened to me before, having lived in London for six years, but I follow the protocol and ring the anti-terrorism hotline to report it, all the while feeling silly but knowing it's the right thing to do. The police arrive in a very impressive three minutes, sirens blaring. They don't tell me what happened, but it appears that a tourist left their suitcase on the street. On the way to brunch, I get papped by a street photographer for looking \"cool,\" which has genuinely never happened to me either. I laugh, knowing that this will make me sound like someone I completely am not (i.e. cool).

We take a quick stroll around Trader Joe's for items for the week: baby spinach, sweet potatoes, zucchini, chips, salsa, mini-peppermint ice cream treats, meatless sausage patties, pasta sauce, and parmesan. My boyfriend pays ($70) since I bought the flights. 9:15 p.m. \u2014 I lay in bed and finish my book before falling asleep.

Since I got an IUD and stopped taking the BC pill, my face has had some rough breakouts. I also have a horrible skin-picking problem that I'm trying to overcome. I try to not wear makeup to work so that I can wear my prescribed acne medication. I microwave and eat two meatless sausage patties for breakfast; they're actually very tasty!

I need to be more willing to delegate and be patient with the process. 10:10 a.m. \u2014 I've really missed playing sports since post-grad.

I Venmo my playing costs to reserve my spot.  $80 11:50 a.m. \u2014 A friend and I eat our lunch together every day. I love L.A. because even in November we can sit outside! I eat my lunch of a 99-cent tuna packet, peanut butter and jelly, and strawberries. After eating, I walk to the library across the street from my office. I drop off two books, one I read and one I did not. I stroll through the \"popular\" section and pick up two books I've heard great things about.

If I let myself sit on the couch, I'll be stuck there until 10 p.m. I call my best friend from home and we catch up on each others' lives for 30 minutes; it warms my heart. Head down to the gym and walk on an incline while starting a new book from the library,  Commonwealth .  $4.99 9:20 p.m. \u2014 Not too hungry after the gym, I eat applesauce with cinnamon and paint my nails. My nails have been a money compromise for me. I love mani-pedis but I couldn't accept the cost. I have been using Sally Hansen Miracle Gel and I love it!

I'm so happy he cooks because I used to eat way too much takeout before we lived together. 1:20 p.m. \u2014 After lunch, my friend and I take a short walk to Starbucks for a caffeine fix.

I'm planning a crucial conversation with my boss: I want more responsibilities and to be more involved with our business partners. I really hope I can grab time with him this week. 11:30 a.m. \u2014 I remember my grandma mentioning that she wanted a new robe. Since I don't know exactly what she likes, I order four from Macy's via eBates (6% cash back) so she can take her pick.

I know it will be a fairly busy day since it's the end of the month. 1:10 p.m. \u2014 Today is so meh. My period is absolutely coming soon. For lunch, I eat leftover pasta and watermelon from the cafeteria. Post lunch, I read a few Money Diaries. I notice I'm antsy and have bitten my cuticle to a point of pain. I decide to make a deal with myself that I can't buy any new makeup (I asked my mom for an Ulta gift card for Christmas) until I make positive progress on this issue; help wanted! 2:45 p.m. \u2014 My work friend and I decided to take a break and walk to a bakery for a pick-me-up.

He's a fifth-year senior (I'm jealous) and lives about three hours away. I usually visit him, but this weekend we're going to watch the Ravens play in Baltimore. We finally get up and head out to breakfast before we drive up. I get breakfast tacos, he gets an omelet, and we both get iced coffees. The bill is about $30; he picks it up. 3 p.m. \u2014 My boyfriend and I check into the hotel we're staying at tonight before the football game tomorrow. I work for a hotel company and get a pretty great employee discount. I get 50% off, making the room rate $99 (normally $200!). I splurged on this hotel a little; it's nicer than where we would normally stay, but the tickets for the football game were an early Christmas gift for my boyfriend and I want it to be special. After taxes and fees, a daily \"resort fee\" of $9.95, and parking for one night ($18), the grand total is $142.87. Splurging pays off: We get a complimentary bottle of wine at check-in!  $142.87 5:30 p.m. \u2014 I sent my mom tons of pictures of our hotel, and she tells me she wants to pay for us to have a nice dinner out! We're staying right in Inner Harbor, so there are tons of cute restaurants all within walking distance. She deposits $100 into my bank account, which is extremely generous of her. My boyfriend and I stop at the wine and cheese event the hotel is hosting on our way out to eat. We each get a glass of sangria and cheese, and then head out to eat. We walk around and survey our options, eventually landing at a burger restaurant and bar. It's really crowded, but somehow we're seated right away. We both order burgers, and each have a couple of beers while we watch college football. The bill comes to $89.09, which comes out of the account my mom deposited money into.

We head out to the breakfast spread, which has locally baked pastries, fresh fruit parfaits, and fresh juices. I grab an almond croissant, an oatmeal and yogurt parfait, and a cup of coffee. We finish eating and order an Uber. I figured it would be just as expensive to drive to the stadium and park, so I leave my car at the hotel and we hop in the Uber.  $11.16 10:30 a.m. \u2014 We arrive at a bar that one of our friends recommended. We've never been to a Ravens game before and we're actually rooting for the opposing team. This bar is cool; there's an outdoor area with a DJ and booths selling drinks. It's a little chilly and they're selling spiked hot apple cider. I order one of those and my boyfriend gets a beer. It's cash only and I have no cash, so he pays. We have Orange Crushes and more beer, and then walk over to the stadium feeling pretty good! Advertisement 1 p.m. \u2014 We get to the stadium just in time for kickoff. As we go through security, I learn that the NFL doesn't allow bags bigger than your hand inside the stadium, and mine is too big. They tell me I can put it in a locker outside the stadium, or throw it out. Ugh. We don't want to get out of line and then wait in it again. It was a cheap bag, so I toss it, but I'm not happy about this. How do you not give advance notice on the tickets for something like that?! We head up to our section and buy a few beers before finding our seats.  $17.87 1:30 p.m. \u2014 We go back down to the concession level for a bathroom break.

I have nothing to eat for breakfast because I'm almost never home on the weekends, so I usually only grocery shop on weekdays.

I load $10 onto my Starbucks card and order ahead for a coffee and a bagel with cream cheese to pick up on my way to work.  $10 11:30 a.m. \u2014 Monday morning is already pretty busy at work. I have a couple of meetings that run through lunch today. I know I'll be starving and cranky if I wait to eat until after it's over, so I head out to grab something early. There's a local, natural grocery store right by our office, which is a blessing and a curse. It's so convenient, but it is not cheap. I manage to find a pre-made ham and cheese wrap that has been discounted, and a brussels sprout and butternut squash salad. I head back to the office to pop the wrap in the fridge and eat a little bit of the salad before I head into my meetings.  $7.54 1:30 p.m. \u2014 My second meeting wraps up and there are snacks!

Normally, I go to Safeway or Trader Joe's and can keep my spending for the week around $25 to $30. Today, I don't feel like fighting the traffic to get to TJ's, so I walk back to the little grocery store by work. It is unreasonably expensive, but just so easy. I grab salad mix, chicken breast, an avocado, cucumber, spaghetti squash and pasta sauce, milk and cereal, and frozen eggplant. I'm a little disappointed in myself as I check out.

Every time I get paid, I move whatever is left in my spending account over to my savings account. It usually ranges from $50 to $100 every paycheck. I also Venmo my boyfriend $40 for all the drinks he bought on Sunday. He texts me and tells me I didn't need to, but I don't mind.

We head to the restaurant and find out we're early for our table, so a few of my coworkers and I head to the bar to grab a drink. We're seated and I order salmon over brussels sprouts and lentils. It's delicious. My coworkers continue to indulge in drinks but I told myself I was going to work out after this dinner. That doesn't end up happening, but at least I saved myself the calories.

A lot of my coworkers live in D.C. and take the metro into Maryland where our office is. I decided to live close to work since I'm still new to the area. A 45-minute commute is considered \"normal\" here, but I don't know if I could do it. I told myself I'd move into the city when my lease was up, but it's way easier being close to the office.

I grab half a bagel with cream cheese and half of a pastry and sit down for their presentation. 12 p.m. \u2014 Lunch arrives! I grab chicken, plantain, beans, and rice, and am so hungry that I eat it too fast. I sit uncomfortably through the rest of the presentation, wishing I hadn't. After the meeting, I work at my desk for the rest of the day. There are leftover beans and rice and I can't stop taking some. I've essentially eaten nothing but carbs today. 5:30 p.m. \u2014 I leave the office and head to Marshalls to get gift-wrapping supplies for Christmas presents. I'll be exchanging gifts with my boyfriend and his family over New Years. He's driving home from school and I'm flying out, so I want to give him the gifts now so I don't have to bring them on the plane. Normally, I raid my mom's stockpile of wrapping supplies for the holidays; this is the first year I'm on my own. I grab a roll of wrapping paper, a few gift bags, tags, and ribbon. I also end up getting a candle, a pink bodysuit that's on sale, and an eyeshadow palette that caught my eye while I'm shopping.

It's hard to find the balance between saving to put extra payments toward my loans, and still having fun without getting too hung up on being in debt.

I prefer to wait until traffic dies down so I don't wasting time going nowhere, even if it means I don't get there until later. That also means the demand-based toll prices for the express lanes will be cheaper. When I'm about to leave, I realize I left the wrap I bought earlier for dinner in the fridge at work. Womp. It will be bad by Monday since it was already discounted. I scold myself and figure out what I'll eat instead. I stop at the Safeway by my apartment and pick up a pre-made turkey sandwich and an iced caramel macchiato to keep me awake.

The stress was not worth it, so I leave at 8 today and eat breakfast at the conference. Standard muffin, fruit bowl, and coffee. At least it's free. 12 p.m. \u2014 Lunch break, buffet style. The Palace Hotel has surprisingly good food. I get raisin walnut bread, salad with crab meat, grilled salmon with fingerling potatoes, and asparagus. I'm also making sure to sample two types of dessert each day: the tiramisu was good, but the chocolate cookie is average. I eat while listening to a long presentation on the global biotech outlook for 2018. 3 p.m. \u2014 I stop by Stuart Weitzman at Columbus Circle. My feet have widened after having two kids, and now only SW shoes are comfortable for me. I love their stretchy boots, but I can never buy them on sale because my sizes are always gone by then.  $707.40 6 p.m. \u2014 I take the subway home. Dinner today is Vietnamese spring rolls, yum \u2014 but my husband refuses to eat because it's fried food. More for me! (We mostly cook at home and spend about $800/month.) After dinner, my daughter goes to a swim class with her father. They don't come back until 8:30 because  apr\u00e8s  swim, she is entitled to visit a dessert place. On swim day, both kids go to bed at 9:30 p.m. After that, I have just enough time to prepare myself for bed.

I have no time for breakfast and am starving by the time the publishing party is done at 9:30. 10:30 a.m. \u2014 I discover that I need to attend a conference in early January. I am probably the last person to register, and it seems like the whole investment community will be there. Luckily, I get the last room left near the conference for $600/night. That same room will cost \"only\" $200 any other time. Unfortunately, all the business class flights are also sold out so I will fly economy. ($4,300 expensed) 12 p.m. \u2014 I plan to fly my family out to join me over the long MLK Jr. weekend. While I'm at the conference, my husband can take the kids explore the city for two days. Then I will join them for the long weekend, and we can take a day trip and a weekend trip to the beach. Flights for them cost $660, but hotels on Saturday, Sunday, and Monday are \"free\" because I have lots of hotel points. (Otherwise, it would cost us $850 plus tax.)  $660 3 p.m. \u2014 I have a meeting with the CEO of an insurance company followed by another meeting with a pharmaceutical analyst. After, I need to do a few write-ups on investment ideas I got from the conference yesterday. 7 p.m. \u2014 We meet up with a group of my husband's friends for dinner at a fusion restaurant in Union Square. The restaurant only opened a few months ago and the food is good; I overeat as usual.  $160 Advertisement 10 p.m. \u2014 My son is still awake when we get home and because he napped earlier.

Today is not too busy, only two meetings total, but some of my investments are not doing well. I need to finish up my write-up and Excel models. 12 p.m. \u2014 I attend a luncheon with Girls Who Code at Bank of America, and get seated next to a very arrogant male hedge fund managers, which kind of ruins the mood. Still, the speaker is passionate and funny, and I will definitely encourage my daughter to code. I can't really help her though because I got a C+ in my college coding class. 7 p.m. \u2014 I have a conference call with an overseas company at 7, so my husband takes the kids to our building's playroom where they can be loud. Later in the evening, after putting them to bed, I enjoy my time planning our trip to Asia next year. I've gone to a conference in Asia every year for the past 10 years, and this is the first time my husband will join me toward the end of my work trip. My flight and I hotels are expensed ($6,500 for the business class flights and $3,000 for the hotels). 11 p.m. \u2014 My husband and I are celebrating our 10th anniversary in 2018, so we \"deserve\" a trip without the kids. We'll spend three days in Tokyo, two nights in Hakone (known for their onsen, or mineral hot springs) at a ryokan (traditional Japanese house with homemade meals), and four days in Kyoto. It is so hard to choose a hotel because they are all rated highly by travelers. That's Japanese hospitality for you. I finally book my husband's economy flight ($1,100) and our accommodations in Hakone and Kyoto ($1,500). The hotels are not fancy, but are in a central location.  $2,600 Advertisement Daily Total: $2,600", "day_five": "Day Five: 8 a.m. \u2014 I take my son to school today. His grandma said he has been fussing and did not want to go to school, but he seems very happy when I take him. He knows how to push our buttons to get what he wants. 12 p.m. \u2014 I am taken out to lunch by my favorite salesperson and good friend. We often go to 15 East in Union Square, and it is absolutely the best sushi place in New York. We do omakase at the sushi counter and chat about work, life, vacations, and girly stuff. ($200 expensed) My friend will also join me during my work trip to Asia, as she has for the last 10 years. She is nine years older with two kids but we are on the same wavelength. (And in fact, most of my friends are older than me.) 9 p.m. \u2014 After the kids are in bed, my husband books a car to drive to Maryland for Christmas ($800), and I book a one-night hotel stay in Washington, D.C. for my family and his sister's family.

Our kids spend hours climbing in several story-high jungle gyms and bouncing around.  $120 Advertisement 12:30 p.m. \u2014 We have lunch at The Cheesecake Factory.

The menu is huge and kids  must  end the meal with two different slices of cake.  $80 2 p.m. \u2014 After lunch, my daughter goes on the merry-go-round.

I bring a gingerbread house kit and all the baking ingredients ($20) since, apparently, my husband's friends do not cook or bake. The kids have a blast cracking eggs, mixing cupcake batter, and decorating a just-out-of-the-oven cupcake we make with lots of icing and sprinkles. They want to eat the gingerbread house too, but that would be too much candy, so I tell them no.

This includes taxes, $200/month FSA, and medical, dental, and vision insurance for my partner, Eric*, and myself. Check From Eric:  $1,428.80 Monthly Expenses Housing Costs:  $1,300/month to rent a one-bedroom apartment with a yard, deck, and driveway. (Free parking is a major bonus.) Our apartment is very, very cheap in part because the unit shares utilities with the other tenants (one-third us, two-thirds them), meaning we have less control over our costs.  Loans:  $100/month for husband's car loan. I finished paying off my student loans last year. Partner student loans are also $0.

I save for Eric's retirement too as he has no benefits. Check To Eric:  $980", "day_one": "Day One: 6:40 a.m. \u2014 It's Friday so I'm allowed to work from home, one of the perks of my smaller biotech company. Everyone in my department works from about 6:30/7:30 a.m. until 3 p.m./4 p.m. so I'm up early with my coffee and cereal. I love my job; a couple of years ago I switched careers and got a salary bump. Because I graduated prior to meeting Eric, I used my salary to pay off my grad student loans last year. I'm also adding to our house down payment fund using my raise. Paying 20% on a condo or house around here costs at least ~$120,000, so despite our income, we struggle to meet our financial goals. I'll pay two-thirds of the mortgage payment due to my higher income but we just throw everything we can into the down payment fund at this point. I log into my credit card account and pay the monthly balance. We put everything on our cards to get points and cash back!  $1,130 12 p.m. \u2014 I make a turkey sandwich and eat an apple, and remember to write Eric my monthly check ($980). Our financial situation is probably the most controversial part of our relationship (aside from the polyamory) as we maintain separate finances aside from the house and retirement funds. When we moved in together, we worked out how much we each spent; the check covers my half of the household costs for the month. It also takes into account that I pay for half his insurance since I have him on all my insurance (health, dental, vision, life, disability). Since Eric and I are married, people think maintaining separate finances mean we are selfish or juvenile. But we don't want to juggle multiple accounts, watch our balances, and check in all the time about spending. We both know how much we have in our accounts all the time, but it takes all the accounting headaches out of the finances to keep them separate. Advertisement 4 p.m. \u2014 After work, my close friend comes over for a bike ride on our town bike path. We stop for oatmeal cookie ice cream ($4.75) and water ($2.25) during our ride, then end at her house where several other close friends come over. We order eggplant and pepperoni pizza (my part is $10) plus I buy wine for the group ($11.99). I ride my bike home; I always bike, walk, or take the T.  $28.99 Daily Total: $1,159", "day_two": "Day Two: 7 a.m. \u2014 I get up early and do our laundry, which costs $2 for each load on our second-floor landing. I save $1 on some of the dryer loads by hanging up my work clothes. I find they last longer that way.  $5 12 p.m. \u2014 Eric and I take a long bike ride and stop to buy groceries for lunch (pork chops and quinoa and carrots) at home. Eric is a fantastic cook, so it's not a hardship to eat in.  $17 2 p.m. \u2014 Eric takes the car to the mechanics. I'm like a 1950s housewife when it comes to the car; it's totally Eric's domain. It's embarrassing but I justify it with the fact that I rarely drive. Because of that, I pay for one-fifth of the maintenance and gas, and nothing for the monthly car payment or insurance. (It was $120 and dropped a ton when we got married, so I save Eric money.) The maintenance check costs $313, and my share is $62.60.  $62.60 Advertisement 6 p.m. \u2014 Today is date night with a new guy I'm seeing. Somerville has a polyamorous community, and my goal is to have a permanent relationship with one or two other people aside from Eric. I broke up with an LTR partner recently so unfortunately, I'm back in the dating world. I'm not sure this will turn into anything, but we'll see. I walk into the square, which is conveniently close to nightlife, and we meet at one of the classier places for dinner. Good conversation, but I don't think I'm feeling it with him. At the end, I offer to split the bill but the guy insists; I know he makes a lot more than me so it's fine. We walk around the square and have fun pointing out how old we are compared to the college kids. He told me a story about being confused about Venmo, and I laugh since I still write checks like an 80-year-old. We grab drinks at another bar and I pick up the tab this time. I walk home around 1 a.m.  $27.16 Daily Total: $111.76", "day_three": "Day Three: 10 a.m. \u2014 Eric and I get up and eat bacon, eggs, and toast at home, then take a long hike. We swing by Starbucks after and I pay. It's kind of a waste of money, but I love my chai tea.  $8.45 6 p.m. \u2014 My Starbucks pastry tides me over until Eric makes an early dinner of spaghetti, homemade meat sauce, and broccoli. He always makes enough on Sundays for either his lunches or our dinner until Wednesday, which saves money. We head out to our local indie theater in the square to see  Professor Marston and the Wonder Women , a movie about a poly family. I pay for tickets ($20) and snacks for us ($9), and we love the movie. It makes me sad about not having another partner though. Eric doesn't care; he's not dating and hasn't in years, so he's not as wistful. We fall into the odd category of being a poly-monogamous couple, which is unusual. We started off both being poly but Eric hates dating and decided to quit. He's too introverted for it to be fun for him, which I get because I hate dating too, but I have always loved being in a serious LTR with a couple of people so it's worth dating to get back into a triad.  $29 Advertisement Daily Total: $37.45", "day_four": "Day Four: 5:40 a.m. \u2014 Coffee and cereal at home. Since it's Monday, I take the T to the office at 6:45. I know I'll be I'm hungry later this morning, so I go to the corner caf\u00e9 and get a muffin ($3.20) which is pretty much a daily thing. I also pick up a fruit cup for later ($2.65).  $5.85 11:30 a.m. \u2014 Lunch at the office cafeteria, which is pretty outstanding. I always get a sandwich and a yogurt and either a granola bar or cookie. I used to be great at bringing food into work when I made less money, and this has become my biggest indulgence. I just don't make an effort anymore to pack food. Our household takeout food budget, which includes lunches like this, is shamefully higher than our grocery bill. Inertia gets me every time though.  $10.47 5 p.m. \u2014 I'm heading home and I'm starving. Eric took the spaghetti to work for his lunch for the week, and he's working late today. I'm too lazy to cook, so I get us burritos from our local place. Eric thinks I'm a hero for getting him a burrito even though it's cold by the time he gets home. We have this quasi-embarrassing habit of eating in front of the TV and watching Netflix until I fall asleep, which is exactly what we do tonight.  $19.04 Daily Total: $35.36", "day_five": "Day Five: 5:40 a.m. \u2014 Coffee and cereal at home. I'm a creature of habit. I get to the office two hours after I get up; it was pouring so my walk to the T and the ride to my office were unpleasant and slow. I never take cabs or Uber though; they add up way too fast! When I walk into the corner caf\u00e9, the ladies get me a muffin as I walk up to the counter without me asking. I'm a baller.  $3.20 Advertisement 11:30 a.m. \u2014 Lunch at the office cafeteria. Today's total is less since I've skipped the cookie. I know there's a social hour at work this afternoon and it's always loaded with food. At social hour two hours later, the catering is on point and I shamelessly grab food and leave it on my desk for later. I'm so proactive.  $8.23 3 p.m. \u2014 My ortho takes my monthly payment out of my FSA account for my Invisalign. My teeth were always straight as a kid but they shifted as an adult. Since my work pays for a portion, plus I have adult orthodontics insurance coverage for the first time, I decide to get them. I'm on month four of an 18-month payment plan, no interest. My one regret is not getting this done prior to my wedding three years ago, but I couldn't justify the expense back then. 5 p.m. \u2014 I'm home and find out Eric has to work late tonight. I'm sort of annoyed I didn't know that before, because I could have either cooked or gotten a pizza instead of burritos yesterday. I get us a pizza and a salad. We're usually way better at cooking dinner, partially to offset the amount Eric and I spend on lunches at the office.  $21.94 Daily Total: $33.37", "day_six": "Day Six: 5:40 a.m. \u2014 Coffee and cereal at home. I go into the office, but no muffin today since I've stored pastries from yesterday's social hour at my desk like a squirrel. I score at lunch too because there's leftover catering which is pretty common in this office. I grab a sandwich and OJ and congratulate myself on being frugal. Advertisement 5 p.m. \u2014 I have a couple of items to return at Ann Taylor. With my new job comes a wardrobe upgrade since the dress code is way fancier. I've spent about $600 or so on clothes in the past several months, which is  much  higher than my usual budget. I take the T to Harvard Square and learn my items are in final sale mode and I can't get the full value back. Instead, I get $50 in store credit and then decide to check out the sale rack and buy a dress ($65 minus the $50 credit).  $15 6:30 p.m. \u2014 I catch the T home, although I could walk. As luck would have it, a friend is on my train and I take it as a sign that we should get dinner together. She just moved into my neighborhood and is demonstrating why I like my area so much \u2014 I run into friends a lot in my small-big city. She offers to split the bill, but I know she makes far less than me so I pick up the check for dinner plus drinks. She doesn't know how much I make and I prefer to keep it that way. My income seems high on paper, but really isn't that great given our area and our crappy college housing. I don't like telling people what I make because it gives them the wrong idea. A lot of people don't know the income disparity between Eric and me and assume he makes a similar amount as I do, if not more; people estimate our discretionary income as way higher.  $67.30 Advertisement Daily Total: $82.30", "day_seven": "Day Seven: 6 a.m. \u2014 I struggle to get up, feeling nauseous. I eat coffee and cereal at home and can't finish it, which is a major red flag since I am always hungry. I believe (and also can't believe) that I'm hungover from last night even though I drank so little. I rarely drink hard liquor anymore though, and our after-dinner whiskey drinks might be the culprit. I make it halfway to the train and decide to abort my trip to work. I swing by our local bakery on the way back to my place and get fortifications for the day, a piece of blueberry coffeecake and an apple croissant. I have conference calls from 8 a.m. to 1 p.m. with a small break, and I nurse the coffee and coffeecake at my home desk.  $6.49 1 p.m. \u2014 Since I wasn't planning on being home, I need to run across the street to get lunch as we have no food at home. Eric will go grocery shopping tonight on his way home from work, but in the meantime I grab a tuna sub. It will last me two days since it's huge, so it's a pretty cheap lunch.  $8.98 4 p.m. \u2014 Done with work for the day and contemplating heading back into work for the company's weekly free happy hour. Decide against it because I could run into my bosses, which is a shame because the amount of food at happy hour is always enough to make dinner out of. Last week was Indian themed happy hour and they had samosas, rice, chickpea curry, beef curry and chicken tiki masala. Advertisement 4:15 p.m. \u2014 We're visiting my cousin who lives in the Upper West Side of NYC in a couple of weeks. I check out the plane, Greyhound, and Amtrak options, and end up getting Eric and I Greyhound tickets. Travel is one of the ways I splurge now that I make more; recently I treated Eric to a weekend in D.C. since I was at a work conference. My meals were being comped, and he could use my hotel room. I bought Eric's plane ticket and a lot of the food, but we don't spend money like crazy. It was still a relatively cheap vacation.  $136 5:30 p.m. \u2014 Eric arrives, grocery bags in hand. (They cost $132, but that is covered in my monthly check to Eric.) I help him unload it and I give him extra gas money, as he's done more errands this week than usual for us. He cooks chicken and rice and veggies, and we unwind to some Netflix.  $30 7 p.m. \u2014 Seeing new guy again. Eric and I were discussing his pros and cons, and I think I should give him another shot. He seems nice, and he's clearly looking for something serious. One of the downsides of being poly is that some people think it's like swinging or always casual, and for most poly people, it's not. Many people aren't just trying to sleep around, and you have to sift through people who are. I meet New Guy at a bar that has outdoor seating and I get a Dark and Stormy. It's unseasonably warm so we have a great time sitting outside and the date goes better than last time. Maybe New Guy is going to be Future Guy. I walk home at 10 p.m., which I can do since my neighborhood is safe and full of people at this time of night.  $12 including tip Advertisement Daily Total: $193.47 * Name has been changed for anonymity.", "url": "https://www.refinery29.com/money-diary-somerville-ma-regulatory-affairs-manager-salary"},

My friends make fun of the fact that every clock in my house is wrong, but it doesn't bother me. I enjoy the extra morning time and prefer believing I've slept longer. Before getting up, I take my temperature for my birth control app. About to finish my period so temperature is lower than usual; bring on the red days! Get up and feed my precious pup, let her outside, and start the coffee. Proceed with my morning routine of putting in my contacts, charcoal and normal brushing my teeth, mouthwash, and applying a homemade oil cleanser, apple cider vinegar and lemon toner, and moisturizer. I'm still on my period, so I take out and clean my menstrual cup. Let the pup back inside where she proceeds to gulp down the rest of her water.

She's meowing at me while I'm pouring my coffee into my to-go cup, filling my water bottle, and putting lunch (dinner from last night) in my bag. I figure she's hungry because her bowl's empty, but poor thing got diagnosed with worms and my fianc\u00e9 has been feeding her a mixture of wet and dry food. Give her some pets and let her know he'll be up soon. Leave my house and start my commute. NPR and coffee coast me through my drive.

A few months ago, I started breaking out around my mouth. When the breakouts lasted for months and throughout my cycle, I looked up various reasons and discovered dairy. When I cut dairy from my breakfast (overnight oats with coconut milk, Greek yogurt, chia seeds, and fruit), my breakouts stopped. I've been meaning to sort out something else to eat besides these individually packaged bars, but life has been crazy! Mentally add that to my to-do list for this weekend. Plug in my headphones and turn on my almost finished audiobook  Stay with Me  by Ayobami Adebayo ( so  good).

This episode was about Whitney Wolfe, the founder of Bumble, who left Tinder due to sexual harassment. She went on to create Bumble as a haven for women in the dating world and workplace. If I weren't happily engaged, I'd totally download the app. Girl power, man! Oh shit, realize I have a meeting, quickly fill up my water bottle and head over. 2:30 p.m. \u2014 Leave meeting, print some maps, and run into a few coworkers I haven't seen in a while. We spend time catching up, which is always nice. 3:30 p.m. \u2014 Finish second design update and leave work! My hours are really flexible. I choose to work from 7:30 am to 3:30 pm without a lunch break because I would rather miss traffic and be home with my love and pets! 4 p.m. \u2014 Get home, feed the animals and let them outside. Change, fill up my water bottle, and put on my favorite YouTube yogi, Lesley Fightmaster! She's very sweet and makes you set intentions before practices, and always gives a quote at the end. 4:40 p.m. \u2014 Feeling good! Let the animals back inside and hop in the shower. After, I fill up the sink with hot water for dishes and proceed to chop garlic and onion for tonight's dinner, Greek lemon and chicken soup! It's incredibly tasty and easy, and definitely a go-to comfort meal on chilly days like today. Toss the garlic and onion in the heated pot with olive oil to saut\u00e9, saving the onion ends and skin for veggie broth. Begin to wash the dishes from last night (unfortunately, we do not have a dishwasher), then add chicken breasts, chicken stock, crushed red pepper, salt, pepper, and one zested lemon to the pot to boil. Finish the dishes and set up the coffee for tomorrow. Advertisement 5:45 p.m. \u2014 With my fella home, I finish the soup adding couscous, the juice of the zested lemon, and feta cheese. We settle in on the couch and watch the third episode of  Stranger Things . 6:45 p.m. \u2014 Oh my gosh, that was so good and stressful! Currently sitting here feeling so sorry for Will and a little peeved at Bob's advice. I remind myself that he doesn't know the whole story. Our friends are playing a show tonight at a local bar. Sadly, part of my costume got lost this weekend at the Halloween party, so we dress as Deadheads instead because that's such a stretch for us ;) Fianc\u00e9 puts the leftovers in containers for lunch and washes the pot. 7:20 p.m. \u2014 After an incredible parallel parking job by yours truly, we arrive at the show and see a bunch of people we know. We grab drinks (a beer for him, gin and tonic for me, fianc\u00e9 pays) and catch up with all our lovely friends. 8:30 p.m. \u2014 Decide to head home after another round of drinks, dancing, and merriment! Fianc\u00e9 pays! 10 p.m. \u2014 Home in bed, contacts out, big ole glass of water on my nightstand. Start cuddling with my fur babies and fianc\u00e9 before falling asleep. What a lovely day!

I don't want to slow crews down! Finish weekly updates and summarize and share our progress with the essential parties. Since no one is editing our design geodatabase, I decide to do some maintenance, which is always better with a podcast:  How I Built This  again it is! I honestly feel like my fianc\u00e9 and I will own our own business one day. Both my parents are entrepreneurs, and my fianc\u00e9 and I are hardworking and diligent. It's gonna happen! 10:30 a.m. \u2014 Finish maintenance and return to my current design project. I get an email from our manager with an amazing opportunity, but I wait like a minute to respond because I don't want to seem too crazy or desperate. Happy dance in my chair after saying yes! Advertisement 11:15 a.m. \u2014 Fill up my water bottle and catch my reflection in the mirror. The flare-up I've been feeling from my cheesy weekend is making an appearance.  CHEESE IS ALWAYS WORTH IT , I tell myself. I grab almonds from my desk and snack. 12 p.m. \u2014 I'm starving so I warm up my leftover soup. After much back and forth, I get the official finalized quote from our caterer. Yay! Something checked off our wedding list. 1:30 p.m. \u2014 Fill up my water bottle and am so proud of myself for consuming so much water today! I'm still battling this headache though, and wishing I had some lavender to ease the pain. Realize I have Excedrin in my draw and take one before I finish catching up on  How I Built This  episodes. After, I decide to stream old episodes of \"The Big Fat Quiz\" on YouTube. I love British television and comedians: Richard Ayoade, Noel Fielding, Jimmy Carr, Russell Brand. I think it's that beautiful mixture of self-loathing, intelligence, and complete lack of censorship that does it for me. 3:30 p.m. \u2014 Leave work, woot woot! 4 p.m. \u2014 Get home, feed the animals, change, and start a load of laundry with some homemade detergent. It's a beautiful day outside, so I take my doggo for a walko! Dog is officially acting ridiculous: so many smells, so much joy! I let her walk part of the way without a leash, and she's everywhere and anywhere all at once. Advertisement 4:40 p.m. \u2014 Home. I open all the windows and doors because the weather is glorious. Move my laundry into the dryer and put a new load in the washer, then I turn on some yoga. During this entire flow, the kitty is bouncing off furniture and wrestling inanimate objects. She then runs full sprint into the guest bedroom door. My spastic animals are cracking me up today! 5:20 p.m. \u2014 Finish my yoga practice just when my love comes home. We kiss and catch up while I fill the sink for dishes. Proceed to wash dishes, set up coffee, and cook a dinner of roasted tomatoes stuffed with quinoa, spinach, and garlic. My fella puts on Widespread Panic from their Halloween run in Vegas. Nothing I love more than jamming out in my house on a beautiful day with the breeze coming through! My fianc\u00e9 empties our scraps bin into the compost outside and continues working on a giant play-scratch house for the cat. (I find it incredibly sexy when he builds things! Especially sweet things for our cat who he loves and talks to so much.) Call my buddy who reached out yesterday but haven't spoken to in a while. We make plans to see each other Saturday. 6 p.m. \u2014 Load of laundry done, fold and put away the clothes. Transfer the second load to the dryer and water all the houseplants. My fianc\u00e9 picks the last remains of our garden: jalape\u00f1os, tomatoes, and tiny bell peppers. Dinner is ready! We load up our bowls, grab a beer for him, red wine for me, and settle into the couch for  Stranger Things . Advertisement 6:30 p.m. \u2014 Dinner was delicious but I'm still starving. I peruse our food cabinet for snacks even though we don't keep much beyond my giant stash of dark chocolate. Grab some chocolate and the last pack of peanut butter crackers (sorry babe) and inhale everything. 7:10 p.m. \u2014 Finish the episode (so intense) and fianc\u00e9 gets up to shower. Typically, we shower together but we're off each other's schedules this week. I get a text from my good friend that she and her fella are coming to town this weekend. Exciting! I haven't seen them in forever. Turns out Saturday is the best day to visit so we agree on then. Damn, our Saturday is jam-packed with activities now. Instead of canceling on anything or anyone, I just plan on overextending myself. I want to see all the friends and do all the things! 7:30 p.m. \u2014 Fine ass fella gets out of the shower and is all dried off\u2026 Sexy, sexy time! 8:15 p.m. \u2014 Fella decides to play video games while I stay in bed, finish my wine, and begin reading  The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers . 9:30 p.m. \u2014 Not ashamed of the fact that I pass out so early.

Advertisement 6:40 a.m. \u2014 Hit the road and hear on NPR that the Houston Astros won the World Series! I'm not a big sports fan, but after Hurricane Harvey, I'm so glad that Houston has something to celebrate. Just yesterday, a dude on NPR was discussing what a relief the Yankees were in the World Series after 911. I hope the Astros brought Houstonians some joy and relief after everything they've been through. 7 a.m. \u2014 Oh man: Now NPR is talking about Trump and the poor victims of the New York City attacks. This morning's news has been an emotional rollercoaster; those poor families. 7:15 a.m. \u2014 Get into the office feeling upset. I'm not religious, but was raised so.

Obama promoting the ACA enrollment worked! 8:30 a.m. \u2014 Listen to an interview with  Full Frontal  correspondent Ashley Nicole Black.  Full Frontal with Samantha Bee  is a such great show, and it has a refreshingly feminist take on political satire. Finish design update, send out the necessary maps and documents, and return to my current design project. 9 a.m. \u2014 LOLOL but SAME to the internet's reaction to Beyonc\u00e9 playing Nala in  The Lion King ! That whole cast is excellent! 12 p.m. \u2014 Fill up my water bottle, warm up my stuffed tomatoes, and send my fianc\u00e9 a recipe for tonight's dinner: roasted eggplant, squash, zucchini, tomatoes, and toasted pine nuts over cauliflower rice. I was a vegetarian for five years, so I prefer allotting meat to one meal a day. This means rotating between meat and meatless dinners. Some weeks, we have more meatless meals because veggies are awesome and don't fart out methane! Turn on Derek Trucks Band to sooth my soul.

Say hello to my honey, who's washing dishes, and pour myself a shower wine. All dried off and slathered with coconut oil, I decide to do my morning face routine. I should regularly do this at night but I'm useless once I sit my bum on the couch. Throw the sleeping bags from when backpacked two weekends ago in the wash and fold and put away the towels from last night! 7:15 p.m. \u2014 Grab my wine and the giant blanket I've been crocheting and settle on the couch. Turn on  The IT Crowd  and relax for the evening. My favorite episode, \"The Work Outing,\" comes on. I have seen this show so many times and still can't help laughing uncontrollably. 8 p.m. \u2014 My love is finished with dinner so he joins me on the couch, where we turn on  Stranger Things . 9 p.m. \u2014 Show over, so much stress released!

Toss the tenderloin in the heated oven and begin cleaning the kitchen. 5:30 p.m. \u2014 My fianc\u00e9 gets home and decides to clean the guest bedroom carpet and sheets for a buddy who is staying with us this weekend. We were trying to leave for the dinner once my fianc\u00e9 got home, but we found out today that our friend needed a place to stay. I turn off the oven and have a minor freak-out: I totally misread the diagram for cooking pork tenderloin and thought it was 20-35 minutes per pound \u2014 not the entire tenderloin. Bah, I thought I would finish cooking it at my parent's house. Fianc\u00e9 grabs some craft beer and we hit the road! Advertisement 6:20 p.m. \u2014 Arrive at my parents' house to a counter of booze. They're the best. We tell them my fianc\u00e9's parents don't really drink but they keep everything out anyways. My dad pours me wine as I turn on the oven and prepare the asparagus with olive oil, salt, and pepper. Future in-laws arrive with pie \u2014 and surprisingly accept wine. This should be a fun night! I lower the oven temperature and place the tenderloin and potatoes in with the asparagus. 7 p.m. \u2014 Take everything out of the oven and squeeze lemon over the asparagus. Dinner ready, us ladies and my fianc\u00e9 head to the table. My father and future father-in-law are so immersed in conversation that they delay joining us. Good sign! 7:45 p.m. \u2014 Dinner ended up great with the pork not overcooked or dry. Hooray! My father teased me about potentially overcooking the meat and not preparing gravy. Who knew pork tenderloin needed gravy?! My father and I are the cooks in the family, but everyone loves the banter. I clean off the table and lovingly tell him he's a giant turd. Place the dishes in the glorious dishwasher, and grab the pie and spice bread from my parents. My mother brings out a bottle of champagne and very sweetly toasts us. 9:30 p.m. \u2014 After a truly wonderful night of introductions and conversations, we all leave my parents' house.

Proceed to make greasy breakfast burritos to cure us all: bacon, scrambled eggs, Greek yogurt, sliced tomato, shredded cheddar cheese, and ALL the Cholula. 9:30 a.m. \u2014 Pack my bag for tonight because we're staying with friends, and I request the boys' opinions for my professional meeting attire. The decision is unanimous. I put makeup on to look even more professional. Usually, I don't wear makeup but since my sister taught me how to do it without looking like an alien, I've actually been enjoying it. I'm even experimenting (via Birchbox) for my upcoming nuptials. I invite our friend, but he's broke and just wants to hang at the house. We ask him to water the plants and take care of the kitty while we're gone. Hit the road with my fianc\u00e9 and doggo! 10:50 a.m. \u2014 Fianc\u00e9 drops me off at the meeting and heads to our friend's house to relax and let the dogs play.

I'm so happy to have been invited and am enthusiastic about my future with this company. We park her car a few blocks away and walk to the theater. (Literally can only say that in an English accent.) We're a little late and my friend still needs to buy her ticket, but I bought mine and my fianc\u00e9's a couple of weeks ago. 3:30 p.m. \u2014 Play finished, we hang outside to discuss our thoughts.

Everyone orders beers and we decide upon a caprese salad, garlic bread, and a large supreme pizza for the table. 8:30 p.m. \u2014 After an incredible meal with fine folks, we order two cannolis and ask for the check. I pay $37.63 for our half of the meal, plus a $7.37 tip. My fianc\u00e9 calculated the tip and I'm frankly surprised it's so low. We both worked in the service industry and typically tip over 20%.

My friend's boyfriend and buddy meet up and my fianc\u00e9 pays for his beers and mine. 10:30 p.m. \u2014 About to head to my friend's show when our out-of-town friends reach out, wanting to meet at another bar. I feel bad about missing my friend's show but am still glad I got to see him! We walk over to the other bar where a crew of people are hanging out! 1:30 a.m. \u2014 Drunk, happy, drunk. My fianc\u00e9 foots our tap all night and I have a feeling the price is brutal. (He thinks about 50 bucks.) We sloppily say goodbye to all the beautiful people and hop in an Uber XL.

I sit at her counter and discuss the incidents of last night as well as her miracle condition. Apparently, she didn't drink as much as we did, or drank more water? Anyways, I'm super jealous right now and shocked because I thought we all threw down hard last night. Her boyfriend is hungover, so we're not the only ones!

We pack our things and take off so our friends can get ready for brunch. 11:30 a.m. \u2014 Home and our buddy is just as hungover as we are! We're the most responsible group of people.

Reheat the pork tenderloin, asparagus, and potatoes from the family dinner. Sit on the couch with the boys and explore new music. Julie Byrne, anyone? 1:15 p.m. \u2014 Clean the kitchen, fold and put away those washed sleeping bags, and start a load of laundry. A few friends stop by and drop off our chainsaw. We stand on the porch chatting, \u201cignoring\u201d the limb of the Bradford Pear screeching against the roof. (It will be sawed off very soon...)

Add a salad topped with tomatoes, bell peppers, and sliced almonds as well as garlic bread. Plates full, we settle in for more  Stranger Things ! We've officially decided to binge watch the whole season because we're hungover and it's incredible! 8:45 p.m. \u2014 What a season! Everyone's impressed. I put away dinner for lunch but leave the dishes in the sink and set up the coffee. It's daylight saving time so we adjust the hour on the alarm clock. The extra hour of sleep after this hangover sounds so nice, but going to bed knowing we're about to miss so much daylight in the afternoons is rough. 9 p.m. \u2014 Cuddling with my dog, I notice a knotted circle on her head. When we went backpacking we noticed a circle in her ear but assumed it was from an ember because the hair around was fringed. Show my fianc\u00e9 and buddy and proceed to google ringworm on dogs.

We're really open about financial stuff, but the holidays are still a time for a little minor sneakiness.  $27.50 2:45 p.m. \u2014 I'm in meetings all day, but am suddenly so hungry I feel like I might barf. I go to the cafeteria at school and get a cup of soup and half sandwich. I'm too hungry to be annoyed at how overpriced our cafeteria is for how boring the food tastes.  $9 5:15 p.m. \u2014 Tonight is \"snack-dinner movie night\" at home. I make popcorn on the stove and a frozen pizza for dinner for the kids, along with a bowl full of Halloween candy to nibble on. They choose  Mary Poppins  from OnDemand and I rent it for $2.99. My Friday nights are considerably less expensive than they used to be!  $2.99 Advertisement Daily Total: $44.23", "day_two": "Day Two: 8:15 a.m. \u2014 The weekend starts with a trip to the YMCA. The kids go to the childcare area; two hours are included with the family membership, which is a great deal considering two hours of babysitting would run us at least $20. I hit the pool for some laps and buy a bottle of water from the vending machine when I'm done.  $1.25 10:35 a.m. \u2014 My husband is working at his part-time job at a sporting goods store, so I drag the kids to Costco. We are out of basically everything, so I stock up on meat, toilet paper, snacks, vitamins, laundry soap, and more. After we shop, we hit the food court for the $1.50 hot dogs and share a $1 churro. I'm amazed at how easy it is to spend over $200 on food and household items. I grew up very poor, and was wildly in debt in my 20s, so sometimes it still feels like magic that there is always enough money in the checking account for groceries or whatever else we need.  $254.89 1:30 p.m. \u2014 I take the kids to a private indoor park so they can run off some energy. While they play, I work on a freelance article. Even though my job pays pretty well, I feel more secure if I have extra money coming in, so I have a side hustle. I'll make $150 once the article is finished, so $16 for park admissions seems like a good investment.  $16 Advertisement Daily Total: $272.14", "day_three": "Day Three: 11 a.m. \u2014 My husband and I try to make sure we each get some alone time each weekend, so I head out to a local coffee shop with my laptop.

At $14 each, I order two more colors and try not to feel crabby about the $7.95 shipping charges. I don't succeed.  $37.84 1:45 p.m. \u2014 My gas light is on so I stop for a fill up of my 2010 Subaru. My car has been paid off for a few years now, and is quickly approaching 100,000 miles. It's been totally reliable, so I'm hopeful we'll get at least another five years out of it before we have to replace it. I've been trying to put a little money aside each month toward an eventual car replacement, but I still owe over $65,000 in student loans from grad school and undergrad so I have a hard time not wanting to throw all my extra money at those loans instead.  $35 Daily Total: $77.34", "day_four": "Day Four: 7:30 a.m. \u2014 McDonald's Diet Coke again.

I've never been one to turn down free carbs.  $1.08 Advertisement 12:15 p.m. \u2014 I meet up with a colleague from another college for lunch. I get the salad bar and another Diet Coke. My lunch date is newly married and about a decade younger than me. We end up talking about kids (she's on the fence about having them) and I shock her by telling her how much daycare and preschool cost in our area. My daughter started kindergarten this fall and the fact that we no longer have a $904 monthly preschool bill has been amazing for our finances.  $17.58 6:15 p.m. \u2014 I'm pooped when I get home and my husband is headed out to his drop-in art class ($20), so I make a last-minute dinner decision to get Chinese delivered. I order one soup and three entrees. We'll easily get three meals out of this, so I pack up some of the lo mein for my lunch tomorrow.  $35.12 11:45 p.m. \u2014 My son wakes us up because he has barfed in his bed. My husband starts clean up duties and I drive to the drug store to get Gatorade and kids Pepto. I correctly predict that we are in for a rough night.

I give my son some applesauce we got at Costco over the weekend and hope I don't catch his bug.  $14.45 Advertisement 2:45 p.m. \u2014 I rent a Harry Potter movie for the sick kiddo and we cuddle up on the couch to watch it.

I use a credit card with rewards points for almost every purchase and then every couple of months, cash those in for a gift card to Target, Starbucks, or Panera. We never carry a balance on the card, so the $100 gift card feels like free money. I spend 30 minutes working on my novel before I head into work. 4:30 p.m. \u2014 After a stressful day at work, I do a little online shopping before I head home. Do I need $26 worth of new pens? No. But buying art supplies is soothing and cheaper than therapy. I also order a bottle of lube, grateful to the gods of online shopping that I don't have to buy that when I have my kids in tow at Target.  $36.75 8:15 p.m. \u2014 My son's school is doing another field trip, so I tuck the field trip fee into his lunch box. We've been back in school for less than four months and this is his fifth or sixth field trip. I'm glad he gets to do fun stuff, but I don't know how some families afford the extras for stuff like this. The cost of this one is $5 for the bus, but we put in an extra $10 for scholarships in case there are kids who can't afford it.  $15 Advertisement 11:45 p.m. \u2014 I get an email from Planned Parenthood requesting a donation, so I give $50. I'm trying to be more consistent in our charitable donations but we're still not as generous as we probably should be.  $50 Daily Total: $101.75", "day_seven": "Day Seven: 7:56 a.m. \u2014 Diet Coke and a yogurt from the school cafeteria. I really need to start eating breakfast at home, but school days feel a little chaotic and I try not to keep soda in the house so the kids don't ask for it. Thankfully, the kids both get breakfast at school (free for all kids in our district) so I don't have to worry about feeding them.  $3.21 11:45 a.m. \u2014 My assistant makes a coffee run, so I give her $5 and she brings me an iced latte. Just the thing I need to get through a budget meeting this afternoon.  $5 8:45 p.m. \u2014 Registration opens for some kid activities for the winter. I sign my son up for indoor tennis and a robotics club. My daughter gets tennis, ice skating, and community ed tumbling classes. I'm always trying to find the balance between not over scheduling them and giving them chances to try new things. I'm guessing I'll need to set aside another $50 for new ice skates for my daughter before lessons start.  $260 9:15 p.m. \u2014 Last summer, we went to family camp for a week and it was amazing. The camp is super popular, so they hold a lottery for registration spots. I put down the $150 deposit and cross my fingers that we'll get lucky in the lottery. If we get a spot, it will cost us just under $2,000 for the week, but I've already got money set aside for that.

{"title": "A Week In Oakland, CA, On $450/Day", "intro": "Occupation:  Multidisciplinary Freelancer. I work in the film industry, but my job changes depending on the day and scope of project. Sometimes I work as a production coordinator on national commercials. I got my start as a costume designer in independent film, and my bread and butter has recently been as a tailor and assistant stylist on commercial and editorial projects.  Industry:  Film & Commercial  Age:  29 Location:  Oakland, CA Salary:  My day rate generally floats between $450-$650, with the occasional $1,000/day thrown in \u2014 but it fluctuates. Paycheck:  $450-$4,080, depending on how many days I've accumulated on a job and my agreed-upon day rate. (I can go weeks without a check \u2014 net 30/45/60 with some clients \u2014 so I'll say I get paid about once a month.) Advertisement Monthly Expenses Housing Costs:  ~$2,280 with internet and utilities, split with roommates \u2014 two currently. The split depends who is living in my loft at any given time and their budget. I recently moved out of the master bedroom; I'm gone so much for work and it didn't really make sense for me to have the biggest space in the unit.  Student Loan Payments:  $450 for private student loans All Other Monthly Expenses Hot Spot Yoga:  $99 for an unlimited membership  Dropbox:  $9.99  Health Insurance:  $275  Netflix:  $10  Spotify:  $10  Renters & Life Insurance:  $35  Amazon Prime:  $12.99.

Protein shake and coffee because I have a yoga class in a little bit and I'm feeling too lazy to make breakfast. 10:15 a.m. \u2014 First yoga class of the day. I pay $99/month for an unlimited membership, and I go as often as I can (which, on days I'm not working, is often twice). 6 p.m. \u2014 Second yoga class of the day. This was one was restorative which felt amazing. Note to self: take more restorative classes. I only wish I could double up like this and end every day with a restorative class. 7:45 p.m. \u2014 Right after yoga, I drive over to a new client's home. I'm designing Salsa competition shirts for a new Oakland dance company (it's the first LGBTQ performance and competitive team in the area). I've emailed, texted, and spoken with the company owners, but this is my first face-to-face with them. They're rad, we totally gel, and I'm excited to get my velvet and rhinestone on. Advertisement 9 p.m. \u2014 One of my friends is getting married tomorrow at San Francisco City Hall, and I've decided to hit a store that's still open to see if they have anything I'd want to wear. I tried on a bunch of stuff, but everything was ugly and not worth the money. 11 p.m. \u2014 Home and beginning to wardrobe plan and pack for the next couple of days. I'm heading to L.A. for a table read of a film I'm producing in the spring. It's a quick trip, only 30 hours, and I'm trying to figure out how to get everything into a large tote bag (I hate, hate, HATE carrying anything unnecessary with me.) This includes deliberation about what to wear to the wedding, if I can go to the airport directly in it, etc. Silently thanking my mom for all the fancy skincare samples she passes on to me, because this way I don't have to buy anything TSA-approved. Daily Total: $0", "day_two": "Day Two: 12 p.m. \u2014 Call a Lyft Line to take me to my friend's wedding. (I should say  friends'  wedding, because I'm friends with both the bride and groom.) I was able to fit everything for L.A. into a tote that fits under the airport seat (small victories!) and plan to change out of my wedding garb as soon as the ceremony is over.  $15.30 1:15 p.m. \u2014 City Hall is super backed up; apparently, the Monday before Thanksgiving is a popular day for folks to get married. I'm starving and so are my friends, so we wander outside of City Hall and across the street to the hot dog vendor, where I buy an insanely overpriced Louisiana Hot Link. I'm still hungry afterwards but refuse to buy another.  $6.75 Advertisement 3:45 p.m. \u2014 The wedding ceremony is over, much later than anticipated, so I have to ditch the post-wedding happy hour and get myself to the airport. It works out well because another friend/wedding attendee has to drive *right by* the airport, so he agrees to drop me off. We both need a little pick-me-up so we stop into Philz Coffee before hitting the road. I pay as a thank you for the ride.  $13 5 p.m. \u2014 At the airport, through security, and still hungry. I cave and go to Cat Cora in the airport next to my terminal and get a soup and salad. Annoyed at airport pricing, but I should've planned better. I'm usually all about bringing my own food/drinks on airplanes (I fly WOW and Norwegian and Spirit a lot, so I'm used to it; I self-fund creative projects so I need to be as thrifty about my travel as possible) but today I've majorly failed.  $15.31 6 p.m. \u2014 I grab a decaf coffee to slam before getting on the plane.  $2.50 9:30 p.m. \u2014 Made it to L.A.! An ex picks me up from LAX. (Funny story: I never got airport pickups when we were together. Our split was friendly, and now I sleep in his living room when I'm in L.A.) We hit Petty Cash Taqueria, get spicy margaritas, tacos, and a quesadilla. I'm exhausted, so we split the bill and decide to call it a night.  $50.13 Daily Total: $102.99", "day_three": "Day Three: Advertisement 8:30 a.m. \u2014 Wake up and drink a protein shake that I brought with me from home. Ex-BF works just as much as me, if not more, so he doesn't really have anything in his fridge either. 10 a.m. \u2014 Meet up with a friend at a nearby Coffee Bean, where I get a large iced coffee. I met this friend through work a few years back; she was an actress on one of the first films that I costume designed. I saw her a couple of weeks ago at a premiere for said film, and now I finally get to meet her almost one-year-old twins!  $4.31 12 p.m. \u2014 Our coffee hangout turns into lunch at The Farmers Market at the Grove. I grab a chicken salad and we continue to catch up and talk shop (film) until I have to leave to meet up with the writer-director of the film I'm producing.  $14.32 1:15 p.m. \u2014 Realized I didn't have my notebook with me so I needed to get a Lyft back to ex-BF's place so I can take notes at the table read.  $5.60 1:30 p.m. \u2014 Grab an Uber to the table read (graciously hosted by one of the writer-director's friends). I did a table read of this script a few weeks ago in Paris with other filmmaker friends because we needed to get a rough estimate on timing. (The script is very dialogue heavy.) This will be the first read with actual actors, so I'm excited to see what they bring to the table. A huge plus is that one of our readers today is a good friend I haven't seen in over a year, and it'll be nice to give him a hug and catch up. He and I have both had a big 2017, and there's a lot to fill in.  $8.80 Advertisement 5 p.m. \u2014 Head to a Mexican restaurant with the writer-director, and some of the other people from the read. I grab a tequila and share in the table's chips and guac. We end up talking for hours about the script and project. I was already excited about it, but I'm glad to know that other (accomplished!) film professionals believe in it as well. The writer-director picks up the bill for the entire table. 7:30 p.m. \u2014 We could all talk forever about this project but the restaurant has gotten too loud with a terrible cover band so we decide to part ways. I grab an Uber back to ex-BF's place.  $4.17 9 p.m. \u2014 Should've actually eaten more at the post-read discussion. I briefly consider just drinking a protein shake, but in the end real food wins. I order a burger/salad thing from The Counter, which is walking distance. Spend the next couple of hours drinking \"birthday champagne\" (a bottle of Veuve Cliquot that ex-BF got as a present a few weeks ago) and catching up on work and life (mostly work) while half-watching the second season of a YouTube Red show that he produced and I worked on when we first met. I'm already dreading my 3:30 a.m. wakeup, so it's bedtime for me.  $14.94 Daily Total: $52.14", "day_four": "Day Four: 3:45 a.m. \u2014 Leave for the airport. My flight isn't until 7 a.m., but it's the day before Thanksgiving. I'm chronically early for things and the airport is no exception. I've missed flights before so I err on the side of very early when I can. Plus, my mom sent me a picture of L.A. traffic and I haven't been able to check into my flight online.  $28.90 Advertisement 4:45 a.m. \u2014 FUCK. So the reason I couldn't check in to my flight is because Spirit automatically canceled it, so I'm stuck buying a new one-way ticket. When I first bought the round trip ticket, I didn't know about my friend's wedding (it was a last-minute thing). I ended up having to use flight miles to book a later flight out so I wouldn't miss the wedding. Apparently, when you miss one leg of your flight on Spirit, they auto cancel the other flight(s). Is this a thing? I want to get mad, but I just pony up the new fare and get through security.  $76.20 5 a.m. \u2014 This morning isn't the best. I left my protein shake powder at ex-BF's place and I'm starving, so I grab an overpriced breakfast at Rock & Brews at LAX and watch  The Incredible Jessica James  on my phone while I wait for my flight to start boarding. I'm kicking myself for how expensive this 30-hour L.A. trip has been, but decide to stop beating myself up and travel prepare like I usually do for the next L.A. jaunt (mid-December for a SAG Indie workshop).  $21.51 8 a.m. \u2014 Back in Oakland! Grab a Lyft from the airport and go home so I can pass out for a few hours.  $10.10 4 p.m. \u2014 Wake up super groggy, throw on yoga clothes, and head to the fabric store and pay for parking. I'm sourcing the fabric for the salsa team's costumes. I walk in and am told they're closing at 4:30, because tomorrow is Thanksgiving. I'm usually much better about double-checking closing times for stores (mostly because I hate driving and sitting in traffic), but I didn't even think to today. Do a quick walk through and see that there isn't any fabric in stock that I can use for the costumes. It really hasn't been my best day.  $1.50 Advertisement 4:30 p.m. \u2014 Now I've got a bunch of time on the meter and lots of time to kill before yoga at 6:30. I walk to a nearby coffee shop and grab a coffee and something to snack on while I catch up on podcasts (and people-watch!). This coffee shop is really close to U.C. Berkeley, so there are a bunch of students studying. Every time I see students studying in a coffee shop, I say silent thanks that I finished school years ago.  $6.23 5:30 p.m. \u2014 I still have some time to kill before yoga, so I switch to trip planning mode. I'm co-planning a MLK Jr. weekend trip to Tahoe with some pals. The other host was able to book one suite through her timeshare, but since it's a holiday weekend, a second suite isn't available unless we book at a regular rate. I choose a six-person suite and put down the deposit.  $400 6:30 p.m. \u2014 First yoga class of the day. It's been really nice to get back into my practice. I've had to sit out most of this year because I wrecked my back pretty badly earlier this year in a car accident. Some days are more pleasant than others, and today I definitely bring all my BS from the day onto the mat. The class is hard \u2014 mentally \u2014 to get through. 8 p.m. \u2014 Second yoga class of the day: a yin class to balance out the vinyasa flow class I just did. I thought the yin would help my mental state, but I couldn't calm down or enjoy the practice like I usually do. Advertisement Daily Total: $544.44", "day_five": "Day Five: 11 a.m. \u2014 It's Thanksgiving! My friend from L.A., the one with twins, gave me a bunch of baby clothes to bring to our friend who conveniently lives close to my parents, so I'm stopping by her house en route to my family home. It's my first time meeting her little one, so we spend a couple of hours catching up and playing with her son. 1:30 p.m. \u2014 At my parents' house. I saw them a few days ago for an hour or so, but this is my first time actually getting to hang out and chat since August. We only live 30 miles from each other, but we're all often traveling so it's not uncommon for us to be on different continents at any given time. I chat with my mom as she finishes making dinner and shop YogaOutlet's Thankful Thursday sale. I'm planning to do a yoga teacher training in early 2018, and my yoga wardrobe is very limited so I decide to take advantage of the killer prices and stock up. I get four pairs of yoga pants and three crop tops/bras.  $113.91 6 p.m. \u2014 Still catching up! I fill them in on my seven-week Europe trip and they tell me about the last few weeks away. They bought a second home about 10 years ago with the intention of settling there when they're done with traveling all the time. I mention the yoga teacher training to them because I'm trying to figure out how to swing the cost of the three-and-a-half week program ($3,000). I won't be able to work during those weeks (no paid vacation because I'm a freelancer). I already have a lot of planned travel coming up in 2018, so I'm just trying to wrap my head around everything. My dad kind of scoffs at doing a yoga certification in San Francisco instead of in India (he was an Aikido practitioner for over 30 years and has trained in Japan, so I get where he's coming from). I make a mental note to check on the pricing and availability of programs in India when I get home. Advertisement 11 p.m. \u2014 Last Black Friday purchase: I buy a pair of black high-waist jeans with sailor buttons (stoked!) and fresh tortoise shell cat eye sunglasses, and go to sleep.  $56.81 11:05 p.m. \u2014 Just kidding about those clothes being the last purchase. I buy gnome rubber ducks to send to friends under the name of an inside joke I have with friends. (Gnomes aren't unusual for me; I collect them.) They'll get them on Saturday. I love Amazon Prime.  $7.99 Daily Total: $178.71", "day_six": "Day Six: 10 a.m. \u2014 Sleep in and finally roll out of bed to make breakfast. I work so much and it's not unusual to put in 70-plus hours in a week. On off days or weeks, I try to sleep and stay in as much as possible. I do a quick scramble with eggs, spinach, and bacon. I buy these at Costco every few weeks and I only cook for myself, so the cost is negligible and each haul lasts me a few weeks. 12 p.m. \u2014 Yoga! The class is packed; everyone is stoked to be there after feasting the day before. This class is with a teacher I've never had a class with before and it totally kicks my ass. Love it! 2 p.m. \u2014 Home and checking out yoga teacher training programs in India. I've found a ton in Goa and they're less than half as expensive as doing the certification in San Francisco. Even with the flight, it's about a $1,000 savings. I send an inquiry to the school I'm most interested in, and an email to a friend who lives in New Delhi (yes, I know it's nowhere near Goa) to see if he'd like to go on an adventure at the conclusion of the training. Advertisement 8 p.m. \u2014 Eugh. Feeling SO lethargic because I've spent the last couple hours Netflixing. My friends told me I needed a hobby outside of work (ha), so I've been toying with the idea of designing a simple accessories line. In between dropping out of school and starting fashion school in San Francisco, I was making and selling handbags and clutches. I haven't done it since 2009, but my skills and taste have elevated, so maybe it's time? I sketch and research materials for the next few hours. If I do it, it'll be a nice brain break from the design work I do for film and commercials.

Eggs, spinach, bacon, coffee. I'm a creature of habit when left on my own. My work life is so hectic, so I prefer to keep things easy when I'm not working. That, and I'm the laziest person I know when I'm \"off.\" 12 p.m. \u2014 Yoga! Class today with my favorite teacher. The flow kicks my ass but I'm in a much better mental state today than I've been during the practices earlier in the week. And I can do an unsupported bridge again! This is a huge accomplishment for me, because just a few months ago I couldn't even sit or stand without pain, exhaustion, and a brace. 1:45 p.m. \u2014 Head to the grocery store after yoga/before going home. I'm out of coffee and also need to get some Stevia drops. The coffee (Intelligensia) is pricey \u2014 usually I find it on sale, but no such luck today. It'll last a while since I'm the only person drinking it. As soon as I get home, I make some bulletproof coffee for an energy boost.  $18.98 Advertisement 3 p.m. \u2014 Flipping through Instagram and I see one of my favorite accounts (@garancedore) posted about the book,  Women Who Run With the Wolves . I immediately click onto Amazon and buy it.  $5.74 3:05 p.m. \u2014 As soon as I bought the book, I remembered I needed to get a gift for an upcoming annual White Elephant gift exchange. The rules changed this year: no more gag gifts and only useful items. I was annoyed but realized it makes total sense \u2014 no use in wasting money on things people won't use. (Damn getting older and more sensible!) I look through Amazon's Black Friday deals and choose a rad backpacking double hammock. There are several backpackers in this friend group, but I'm secretly hoping I end up with it.  $34.95 4 p.m. \u2014 Realize that I need to replace my planner and Moleskine notebook soon. I'm super analog when it comes to scheduling, note taking, and lists. Go to reorder my usuals, but I'm annoyed at how expensive they are. Decide to do some comparison shopping and look at notebooks/planners from Muji, but I can't make up my mind. I end up not buying one. 8 p.m. \u2014 Dinner with my landlords! I've lived in my building for five years and my landlords live in the building. We've gotten pretty close. We all have crazy work commitments so hanging out doesn't happen very often; the last time was back in September before I went to Europe. They're chefs, so I know whenever we go out the food and wine will be great. They choose a hot pot/steam restaurant in Oakland, and I defer to them for all ordering. They pick up the bill.

Trip over unidentified body spread out over living room floor, and realize it's my sister seconds before I call the police. I wake her up and send her to make pancakes while I shower. Her having a key might be a good idea after all... 7 a.m. \u2014 Hurrah, I'm out of the door on time! I leave my sister (somewhat) awake and remind her she has a couple of classes today that she really isn't supposed to miss. Make a mental note to add \"Surrogate Mom\" to my job description when our mother is out of town. Get on the train into London with my contactless bank card. The fact I never spend cash on traveling makes me feel slightly better. The fact I'm pushed nose into armpits the entire commute makes me feel less so. Arrive at work without forking out any money on additional coffee or breakfast or Random Amazon Purchases!  $8.99 8:30 a.m. \u2014 I started a  very  small startup with a great coworker about two years ago. At the moment, it's just the two of us and an admin assistant, which works well because we get on great! Anything above salaries, office hires, administrative supplies, and a small reserve fund gets split equally as \"bonuses.\" So far, we're breaking even and are even considering branching out and hiring more, which I consider a plus. The admin assistant (we'll call her A.) brings in Starbucks for the two of us and puts it on a company card. My business partner (H.) is away for the next couple of days so it's just two of us in the office. Advertisement 11:15 a.m. \u2014 After a morning of staring at a computer screen and writing policies, I need to get outside. A newish client of ours calls and asks to meet up, so I head out. The client runs an IT startup and has an issue with a new staff member. We walk around a central London park for a couple of hours and I run down what he needs to do legally, and what I would do in the situation. He seems remarkably happy with the outcome and leaves happy. While we are walking, I buy us coffees from a vendor but they don't have receipts so I can't claim. Doh!  $9.12 2 p.m. \u2014 Get back to the office and eat a KIND bar and a satsuma. We don't usually claim anything other than coffees or client lunches, but we each bring in random crap from time to time and chuck it in a free-for-all pile. (Except chocolate: Those babies stay right in my desk where they belong!) 4:45 p.m. \u2014 I don't usually leave this early but there's such a thing as too many emails, and I've hit that ceiling for the day. Plus, I have plans. I grab a brie and cranberry sandwich, a Diet Coke, and carrot cake bar from the shop on the way to the tube ($4.69) and then get myself across London to my next destination ($3.75)  $8.44 5:30 p.m. \u2014 On Monday evenings, I tutor as part of a disadvantaged kids scheme in a rougher area of the city. I take a group of six 13-year-olds in math for an hour or so, and then swap and get six 15-year-olds in history. Their behavior isn't the world's greatest, but it makes the victory sweeter for me when they understand a concept. After we finish, I grab a slice of pizza the organizers bring to bribe the kids and reward the staff, and chat with a few other tutors. We arrange to go out for drinks after a volunteer meeting on Thursday. Advertisement 8 p.m. \u2014 Home! It's a stressful commute because my mother just arrived back in London and can't figure out how to use Uber. (I've only demonstrated 100 times!) I tell her where to wait, what the Uber will look like, and what the reg will be, and she still manages to miss it...twice. When she's finally in the car and I've paid two $6.70 missed fees, she calls me and tells me (loudly) how great her flight was and how unhappy the driver looks. (Wince.) Well, I guess that's bye-bye to my five-star Uber customer rating. Her ride comes out at $41.02, plus the late fees. At least my Contactless caps, only charging me $5.63 for the way home.  $60.05 10 p.m. \u2014 Get home and realize my sister has left with my favorite PJs and all the 50 ps from my spare change jar. I should probably set some ground rules, but honestly I'm used to it now. And I love her.  And  trust me: I'll make her pay when she gets a job. I eat all the leftover cold pancakes from breakfast because I'm gross like that and super hungry. Roll into bed without spending more money!

Afterwards, I feel like a champion athlete who has her life together and knows exactly what she's doing. Seriously hoping I don't trip over anything and ruin the illusion. Make a smoothie with spinach, bananas, raspberries, pears and almond milk. Eat a slice of sourdough bread with avocado and Marmite. Advertisement 7:45 a.m. \u2014 Today is a Birmingham day, and just in case you ever considered commuting halfway up a country multiple times a week, don't. My train goes from the local station though, so I don't have to go via London! The tickets are bought by the company several weeks in advance. I plug headphones into my laptop and continue with the super-fun policies I am drafting. 9:30 a.m. \u2014 Here's the deal with the commute: A fair deal of our clients are based here in Birmingham and being able to meet at a moment's notice is important for the business, so I position myself up here a couple of times a week. We can't afford office space though, so I normally park out at a cute independent coffee shop and move around as the day progresses, depending on what the clients need. I greet the friendly waitress and the owner, hook my laptop to the Wi-Fi, and check my schedule. I have three appointments today, and all three will meet me here. I order a water and a latte, but they will bill me at the end of the day. 4 p.m. \u2014 All three appointments and the policies are done, and I'm feeling super accomplished. Throughout the day I've gotten through two lattes, a panini, a muffin and at least five waters. Goodness knows what the clients ordered, but I pick that up as well. The total comes to $34.04 which goes straight on the company card, but I tip $13.40 because I understand how annoying it is to have someone invade your coffee shop for seven hours straight.  $13.40 Advertisement 4:15 p.m. \u2014 A. calls me as I leave the coffee shop, and she has H. on conference. We talk shop for a good while and I browse the shopping center by the train station since I have some time. I'm all kinds of distracted, but Black Friday lasts a week in the U.K. and I manage to grab a great deal on a new work blazer ($46.89) a pair of Vans for the sister for Christmas ($40.19) and some gourmet lemon and black pepper popcorn ($6.43). I decide that's enough damage for now and hop on my train, still on the phone.  $93.51 6:30 p.m. \u2014 Still on the phone when I get home, and am getting slightly annoyed. H. and A. seem to be having some long boring conversation about billing (yes, I know I should care, but I honestly don't). Eventually, I put them on mute and start cooking. I'm starving. I make a massive pesto pasta dish and convince myself that because I put mushrooms and asparagus in, I've earned the carbs. The conversation ends and my phone loads all the WhatsApp messages I've missed. One is from a great friend/FWB asking if I'm free. Um, yes? I put on something nicer than I'm wearing currently and tidy a bit before he heads over. We bed down early, since I'm exhausted. Daily Total: $106.91", "day_three": "Day Three: 6:30 a.m. \u2014 Ah, sleep! I feel refreshed and the fact that my FWB brings me coffee in bed only amplifies this. FWB is working from London today too, but he's driving in so I ditch the underground and grab a ride. H. is back in today and I try to get in first. Success! A. brings Starbucks and we start the day with the completion of the billing conversation from yesterday. I try to contribute, and fail. Advertisement 11 a.m. \u2014 Work, work, work. Today I have lunch with a potential client, and I spend most of the morning researching his company. Seems like it would be my dream job if I weren't doing what I am. A. stops by my desk for a catch-up and seems deviously interested in my night with the FWB. She asks if I'm interested in anything more than the somewhat frequent nights we've been having as of late, and I'm not so sure. I've been close friends with the FWB for years now, and don't particularly want to screw it up with the whole relationship thing (which I'm not great at, tbh). 1 p.m. \u2014 Lunchtime, and boy, is this guy cute! We chat and flirt and generally have fun for the entire hour, but I'm slightly dubious of taking him as a client, because of legal concerns I have about the way his company operates. I explain this to him, and he offers to take me out to drinks to discuss it. Um, awkward? But sure. We make time on Friday night. We ate tons at the sushi place we are at, but he grabs the bill before I can, and tells me he'll write it off as a business expense. Fair play. 6 p.m. \u2014 I wait for the FWB for a ride out of the city, and we stop on the way back at our local ice rink. We both have unlimited passes and keep our skates at the rink, so it's normally a spur-of-the-moment thing. I used to skate semi-professionally and so did he. (It's how we met and became friends!) Now we just use it as a fun way to work out and (literally) chill. We grab burgers on the way out; he pays. Advertisement 9 p.m. \u2014 Completely forgot my mother and sister were heading over for a late dinner, and quickly order Dominos. Alas, I am full from my burger, but I get to watch them eat (and steal the best slices for breakfast in the morning!). We catch up on  Designated Survivor,  and I catch up on a few work emails and texts. After they head home, I crash into bed. I only paid for a pizza today: I am a money-saving ninja.  $20.10 Daily Total: $20.10", "day_four": "Day Four: 7:45 a.m. \u2014 It was a BAD morning... I remember little, but my bank statement tells the sad tale: One large coffee on the way to work ($3.75), the commute itself ($9.11), and another coffee and croissant near work ($9.25). I look like hell in the mirror, and am wondering if this is a sign from above that I should not go out to drinks on Friday with this new guy? I contemplate whilst burying myself in a massive workload, surfacing only for the occasional Haribo or KIND bar.  $22.11 12 p.m. \u2014 A. feels sorry for me and brings me a bagel, which I scarf down while browsing Amazon. (Remember when I said I hadn't made any Random Amazon Purchases yet? Here's why I was afraid.) I buy fairy lights for my room, a star-shaped cake pan and pillows. I share an account with my mother, so I transfer her $33.53 to cover it.  $33.53 4 p.m. \u2014 It's been a haze of work and snack food, and I finally leave the office and head across London for more tutoring, the volunteers meeting, and drinks. I teach math for an hour, and then our meeting begins. We discuss some of the regular kids' ongoing issues, what extra support is needed, etc. We are also losing a couple of volunteers so I offer to tutor two sessions on a Thursday instead of one. The leader looks at me like I'm a godsend, and I'm content with my hero status. I beg off drinks because I'm still not feeling great, and head home. Through some weird fluke, I'm not charged for my commute to or from the school I tutor in. Advertisement 8 p.m. \u2014 I get home and pretty much collapse on a heap in bed. I call A. and discover I have no actual clients to meet in Birmingham tomorrow. Unless that changes, I'm not going to make the trek. The FWB calls to see if I'm around. I explain how I feel and beg off, but he shows up with lemons, ginger, and honey to make tea, and basically babies me until I fall asleep. Quite simply, he is the best. Daily Total: $55.64", "day_five": "Day Five: 10:45 a.m. \u2014 Well that was a long sleep! I wake up with the FWB beside me and thank my lucky stars that he is around. I'm beginning to feel guilty about this date tonight though. FWB is beginning to feel a lot more like BF, and I feel like a conversation might be around the corner. I decide I'll wait for him to initiate though. FWB has the day off so we head over to our fave brunch place/old haunt and get waffles with as many toppings as humanly possible. I grab the bill since he's been paying for everything recently.  $43.93 2:30 p.m. \u2014 We decide to make a day of it and head to a local market as we're both pretty much out of food. I buy broccoli, mushrooms, leeks, asparagus, squash, a swede, sweet potatoes avocados and garlic, as well as a freshly baked loaf of sourdough. He buys pretty much the same, but they only accept cash so he pays. Next, we head to the local supermarket and I buy juice, sprite, pasta, halloumi, black beans, almond milk and canned tomatoes. He also picks up a basketful, and I cover the cost for the both of us. We head back to mine for a little Netflix and chill.  $75.96 Advertisement 5:45 p.m. \u2014 I casually (I hope!) bring up my plans of going into London this evening for work drinks, and FWB insists I haven't crashed enough yet and suggests bailing. Though I find the suggestion sweet, I don't generally drink anyways so I know the night won't be too rough. We part ways and I jump on a train into central. Again, my card doesn't charge me for the travel and I feel super lucky right now. This may wind up being a cheaper night than I assumed! 5:57 p.m. \u2014 I spoke too soon on the cheap evening front. The Bestie texts me to remind me to buy Trevor Noah tickets for his show at the O2 in six months, and I head over to the Amazon Tickets website because I have a voucher. All the good seats have sold out and the only ones left are SUPER high and far back. On the plus side, they're cheap! It comes to $80.07 but the voucher knocks a fair bit off.  $46.57 7:15 p.m. \u2014 Well that was awkward. Cute New Prospective Client brings one of his investors, L., and L. brings a date. L. gets really drunk and keeps making super inappropriate jokes about where the evening is going to go. Even his date is embarrassed, as is the Cute Guy. I drink a lemonade, but I'm really not feeling tonight and bow out after a little shop talk. Cute Guy says he will grab the tab we've opened on his way out, but I pay anyway and put it on the company card.

I'm starving \u2014 and take it from a London girl \u2014 Nando's is the only place worth heading for a mammoth pile of junk food. I get a chicken burger, spicy rice and garlic bread to-go, and eat it cross-legged in the middle of an aisle on a packed train. I try not to count all the people judging me right now, but it's hard. The FWB texts and asks how the night has gone. Um, not good? He's near the train station anyway, and swings by to pick me up and take me home.  $16.89 Daily Total: $183.35", "day_six": "Day Six: 8:30 a.m. \u2014 Wake up for the third morning this week with the FWB by my side. Life could be worse. Mindful of all he's been doing lately, I get out of bed and leg it down to the bakery around the corner, and he wakes up to fresh croissants and coffee. He's in the mood for a long, lazy lie in. I'm not opposed, but I have a bunch of work to catch up on from yesterday, so I bring my laptop into bed.  $2.65 11:45 a.m. \u2014 I have plans for the afternoon so I ditch the laptop and put some actual clothes on. I leave the FWB in bed and head into London. Obviously, the day needs more coffee than my place can supply, so I stop at Starbucks. ($4.82) The transport gods are not on my side today, and I get charged for my travel. ($8.31)  $13.13 Advertisement 3:45 p.m. \u2014 The program I tutor for during the week is having a career fair at a large secondary school today, and so I'm speaking for half an hour about the joys of working \"with people\" to around 500 teenagers. I'm not really an extrovert so this takes a lot coming from me. I think it came off well, but I'm exhausted from the second I step off the stage. I thank the organizer \u2014 it is truly a great event \u2014 and head home. I can't resist stopping to pick up my mum's Christmas present from the White Company: a giant, shaggy grey throw. They have 40% off for Black Friday (seriously, stop saying every day is Friday) so I only part with $87.07. Return rail fare is $8.31.  $95.38 5:30 p.m. \u2014 I get back to my place and the FWB suggests we head to his place to cook dinner, which I am totally up for. FWB lives with his parents but they are away a lot. Their house is AMAZING though! My sister texts during the drive to ask if I need anything, which is code for \"I'm broke.\" I'm in a particularly lazy and selfish mood and suggest she tidies my apartment and does laundry while I'm out. She agrees, and I transfer her some cash.  $26.80 7:30 p.m. \u2014 Dinner was amazing; FWB sure can cook! We eat asparagus, chicken, salad, and chocolate fondue with strawberries AND marshmallows. I feel like a kid again. FWB also brings up the exclusivity/dating aspect during dinner, and suggests we do a trial basis of dating, which I'm totally up for, as the main reason I didn't want to dive into this in the first place was the fact I could quite easily screw it up!

Turns out one of our biggest clients is having a mini-meltdown and everyone is heading into London now. I remember the downside to owning a startup, and try not to wake up the BF while desperately hunting down clothes. I find a pair of my jeans in the wardrobe, tuck one of the BF's white shirts into it, and pull on my converse of last night. Look in the mirror. Well, it will have to do. Kiss the BF goodbye and head out of the door. Ticket barriers are down on a Sunday mornings into London so travel = nada. Plus, no time for coffee. Look at me, winning at the whole not spending money thing. 10:15 a.m. \u2014 The client, A., H., and I all meet in a Pret. I'm the last to arrive (imagine that!) but A. has already brought me a chai, a muffin, and dried mango. I realize I would probably die if it weren't for her. It takes a few hours of reading policies, chatting with the client's other staff members over the phone, and generally calming everyone down, but eventually we get everything sorted. The client jokes we should bill her more because we had to come in on a Sunday, and we all give each other looks. I leave and find the BF waiting outside the Pret to surprise me. (Due to the Find My Friends app; he's not a stalker.) Did I mention yet he is the best?

I finally have money saved up for an apartment deposit so I'm ready; my goal is January! Advertisement 12:30 p.m. \u2014 Chicken for lunch. Everyone seems to be in a Friday mood, so I just do online shopping and make tweaks on a writing assignment. My coworker and I also go to the Amazon Book Store and I buy  Mr. Penumbra's 24 Hour Bookstore . It has amazing reviews and I can't wait to start reading. The cashier convinces me to add on a holiday book that will be donated to children in hospitals ($3). Kids are my weak spot, especially since I have a seven-year-old sister.  $14 7 p.m. \u2014 I have to replace my MacBook (another thing that got stolen) so I go check out the laptops. My friends raised money to help me get a new laptop, and friend-of-a-friend is also letting me use her family and friends discount. I am so grateful for the people in my life. I make my decision after talking to some of the employees, who are so nice! I used to work retail during my college years to completely financially support myself and I low-key miss customer service. Going to officially order the laptop in a few days! 7:30 p.m. \u2014 It's snowing tomorrow and I am not ready. I go to Uniqlo and pick up HEATTECH clothing. A lot of it is on promotion, so I get one black crew neck ($10), black leggings ($10), a turtleneck ($10) and socks ($6.99). I also see a cute velvet dress that I can't resist getting ($19.99). I don't buy a lot of clothes but I decide to treat myself. Plus, clothes for the weather are a necessity.  $57.50 Advertisement 9 p.m. \u2014 It's a chill night today. I make tea and toast whole wheat bread and top it with honey. I turn on my YouTube vlogs and play Christmas music in the background.

I'm a Texas native and the most snow I've seen is maybe two inches. It looks absolutely beautiful. I look out the window, boil water for my tea, and make two eggs over toast for breakfast. I pour ketchup on the side. My roommates are starting  Jane the Virgin  so I watch an episode with them. 12 p.m. \u2014 I've got a lot of holiday shopping to do this weekend. I get on the train to go into the city. My first stop is Union Square Holiday Market. 1:30 p.m. \u2014 I ended up getting a colorful wrist wallet for my mom. She loves bright colors and I found a perfect striped one. This is the first year I can actually afford to get my family and friends real gifts, and that makes me so happy. The snow is falling, the vendors are all happy, people are bundled up in their coats, and I smell hot chocolate. It is such a beautiful Saturday!  $30 2:45 p.m. \u2014 I meet up with a friend and her boyfriend at my next stop, the Bryant Park Holiday Market. I need to find something for my Secret Santa today since the gift exchange is tomorrow! She recently moved into her new apartment, so I decide to get home decor. I find a beautiful Italian ceramics vendor and buy a little blue and white bowl. We walk around more, watch people ice skating, and look up at the huge tree. Sometimes I can't believe I'm really in NYC under the snowfall experiencing my first real winter! The holidays make me emotional.  $12 Advertisement 3 p.m. \u2014 I've never been to the Chick-Fil-A in New York so we decide to go there since I am craving it so much. The line is long and filled with drunk people participating in SantaCon but we get our food fast. I order a chicken sandwich meal with lemonade. I am so mad at how expensive this meal is; it's double the Texas prices. Definitely will not be coming here often.  $10 5:30 p.m. \u2014 I'm getting an eye exam today \u2014 a long overdue visit. I haven't gotten a new pair of glasses in three years and my best friend works at Warby Parker, so his discount is super nice. I get an eye exam ($75), which should be reimbursed as soon as I call my mom to get insurance details and the pair of glasses I choose is only $87 after his family and friends discount. They're so cute and I can't wait for them to ship. I love a good pair of statement glasses. Merry Christmas to me!  $162 7:30 p.m. \u2014 Today is a coworker's holiday party! I head back home and watch a little YouTube. My friend is coming over with a bottle of wine before we head to the party. 10:30 p.m. \u2014 My friend and I check out a bar near my apartment that has cocktails on tap. I get an amazing lime drink. I haven't bought a drink in ages (I try not to spend much money on alcohol), so this is a nice treat.  $10 Advertisement 11 p.m. \u2014 We make it to the party. Very tipsy. Let's see how the night goes! Daily Total: $224", "day_six": "Day Six: 9 a.m. \u2014 Well, last night was fun! Recap: My friends joined me at my coworker's party, then we drunkenly had snowball fights at the park on our way to a dance bar, then we danced a lot, left and had more snowball fights, ended up at Popeyes, and everyone crashed at my place. It's been a long time since I had one of these nights and playing in the snow was one of the purest and most carefree times I've had in awhile. But I have an awful headache. Ugh. This is why I don't drink a lot very often. 10 a.m. \u2014 We decide to check out a cute little diner right by my apartment, and it's so cheap I'm in shock. Two eggs, hash browns, toast, home fries, bacon, and OJ for only $5.50! It's so inexpensive that we decide to split two waffles among the four of. us. We order the fresh fruit waffle, which comes with the strangest selection of fruits. Watermelon on my waffle? In this economy? Super weird but the waffle itself tastes good. We make a mental note to never order that again \u2014 but I'm still coming back.  $10 2 p.m. \u2014 After breakfast, my friends leave and I crawl back into bed and slept for another three hours. My headache is, sadly, still not gone. My coworker's birthday brunch is in an hour so I head to the East Village. Advertisement 5:30 p.m. \u2014 Leaving his birthday brunch which really ended up being just an early dinner. I wasn't hungry so I ended up just getting an order of fries.  $9 6:30 p.m. \u2014 I need to get a gift bag and another little thing for my Secret Santa gift, so I go back to the Union Square Holiday Market. I feel like I've spent my entire weekend here. I get a little set of different scented tea candles ($12), a white gift bag ($3), white tissue paper ($2), and a little white bow ($2).  $19 8:30 p.m. \u2014 Secret Santa time!  Eclipse  is playing in the background and one friend brings two boxes of pizza; the host has hot chocolate for us. My person ends up loving her Secret Santa gift! My Secret Santa gets me a candle called City Scapes: Central and it smells like oakwood and ginger; it's beautiful. He also gives me a little pin that I love. 11 p.m. \u2014 We finally leave and my friend lets me sleep over at her place today since it's getting late.

It's Bagel Monday so I have a plain bagel with cream cheese and my usual blueberry green tea. 12:30 p.m. \u2014 For lunch, I go get tomato soup with a free coupon I have. Today's a slightly chill day with just a few meetings and brainstorming my art director and I have to do for some social media posts. The office seems dead today! A lot of people are already gone for the holidays. Advertisement 1 p.m. \u2014 Small Tinder/Bumble break. I haven't been on a date in so long, especially since I've been so jittery lately but I do really want to start dating. I'm a romantic at heart, so ideally, I'd love to just fall in love with someone randomly at like a bookstore and we lock eyes and live happily ever after. But it's 2017, everyone is \u201cfinding themselves\u201d, I'm super busy, they're super busy, and dating is just hard. But may as well make an effort and set aside time for dates. I swipe for a few minutes and immediately am over it. I'll just be single forever! I'll try again later. 6 p.m. \u2014 I leave work and head to the Apple store. I'm picking up my new laptop today! I literally couldn't have done this without the help of my friends and friends of friends. The pick-up line is hectic but it moves fast. I take an Uber home because I don't want to be carrying around a huge Apple bag with a spanking new laptop inside. I have a free ride because of my complaint to Uber of the sketchy driver last time, so this won't cost me anything. 8 p.m. \u2014 Ahh, the new keyboard feels so nice! I set up the laptop and read for a bit. For dinner, I make eggs and black beans. Eggs for dinner are the best. Then, I eat raspberries and blueberries for dessert. I do a bit of online shopping and see an art print that my brother would love so I have to get it. I still have so many other gifts to buy.  $13 Advertisement 9 p.m. \u2014 Short at-home butt and abs workout. I really need to get back to the gym soon. It's been over a week since I've gone, but it's the holidays and I'm going back home for two weeks soon anyways. My mom will be feeding me nonstop, so maybe I can start in 2018?

(The most recent one was over $10,000.) He gets paid twice a month, about $2,500 after taxes and insurance, which he covers both of us.  Paycheck (Weekly):  $1,259. My husband and I do not share a bank account; we keep our personal expenses separate, so aside from household expenses and travel, we don't really keep tabs on each other. What works for us is for him to auto-pay our bills from his account and for me to pay him twice a month \u2014 the first of the month for the mortgage, and around the 15th for electric, cable, internet, water, and groceries. I do all of the grocery shopping and pay for it with an AmEx that is in my name but is his account, that he pays for. As for dining out, he typically pays for the more expensive meals and I pay for the less expensive ones (unless I offer beforehand or it is a special occasion).

I put $500 to each card every month, and when the smaller one is paid off, I will shift that money over and make an even larger payment. So far I am on goal.

I start my usual morning routine: wash my face, skincare, and take care of the dogs and cat while my moisturizer sinks in. I'm a skincare freak. Plus, for the amount I spend on my La Mer cream I want to give it every opportunity to succeed. I start in on my makeup routine, halfway through my process I hear a crash in the kitchen. I run in there to find that the cat has knocked over my crystal vase of flowers, all over my clean kitchen floor; thankfully the vase didn't break. I clean up the water with and vow to re-mop the floor when I get home tonight. Out the door only 15 minutes late, I grab a drive-through sandwich on the way to work from Chick-Fil-A and eat it as I drive. My boss is already at the office when I get in, which is out of the ordinary but she is super chill so I start my day.  $6.27 Advertisement 10 a.m. \u2014 Get a call from my car dealership valet, who is out front with my car. I go outside and it is way chilly in the not-so-winter dress I decided to wear. Everything looks fine, so we exchange cars and he is off. I will admit I probably pay too much for my car, but it is a luxury car and they have so many perks, like valet service whenever I need something. This time it was only an inspection, which cost me, but usually, everything is covered.  $25.50 11:30 a.m. \u2014 I get a text from my dealership service manager saying I left my garage door opener in the loaner car. He offers to mail it to me but I have such a busy weekend, I opt to just go get it. Since it is around the time I leave for lunch normally and the dealership is only 15 minutes away, I get going. As I'm driving down the road I notice a weird rattling sound. It wasn't there before, so I turn my music down to keep listening as I drive. I only notice the sound when I accelerate from a stop. I get to the dealership and get my garage door opener, let my service manager know about the sound, and we drive around the block so he can hear it for himself. He agrees that it is not normal, so I swap cars again for a loaner and go back to my office. 2 p.m. \u2014 Back at my office and starting to get hungry from my no-lunch adventure, I check my drawer and find a KIND bar I stashed away. I munch on that as I work on finishing a bunch of projects. I am taking a vacation day tomorrow and need to get shit done! Advertisement 4:45 p.m. \u2014 My service manager lets me know my car is ready; it turns out someone didn't snap some clip under my hood, he is super apologetic and offers to bring my car in the morning. I decline since I won't be at my office tomorrow and my house is a good 25 miles or more from the dealership. I mentally prepare myself for traffic and leave a bit early. Forty-five minutes later, I am back at the dealership and back in my car. I can now start going home. My BFF texts me and lets me know she is only about two hours from my house, which make me super happy since I haven't seen her since we went to Paris in May. I call my hubby on my way home, stuck in traffic yet again. We chat about my car and his day and what my BFFs and I have planned for the weekend. 6:45 p.m. \u2014 Finally almost home. I call hubby again and ask him if he wants me to grab dinner since I am way too tired to cook tonight, plus the BFF should be here in about an hour. We decide on Chick-Fil-A and even though I already had that for breakfast, I am so tired and hungry at this point that I don't care. I swing by the drive-through to get us sandwiches. I let hubby pay for this one using the credit card I have, and finally get home and eat dinner. Once we are finished I do some last-minute straightening and mopping of the kitchen from the morning accident and wait for the BFF to arrive. Advertisement 8:15 a.m. \u2014 She's here! Once she gets settled we all sit in the living room catching up. I'm so glad my BFF and husband get along and can do things like this, and I don't have to feel like I have to choose who to spend time with. We decide to put on a movie and drink some cocktails. I make them whiskey and Cokes and open a bottle of Mo\u00ebt for myself. I know it sounds so bourgie, but I have been on a serious Mo\u00ebt kick for the past few months (which is weird because I usually only drink whiskey). We finish the bottle and the movie; it's about 1 a.m. at this point so we call it a night. Poor hubby has to work in the morning.

I decide to not fight it and get up and take care of the dogs and cat. BFF is awake too by this point; we chat a little and decide what to do for the day. Shopping, mani-pedis, and drinks are the game plan. We go our separate ways and get ready for the day, then make our way to the mall. 10:30 a.m. \u2014 FOOD is all we can think about! We walk the mall until we get to a cute little brunch caf\u00e9, but they have a weird note in the window saying they are closed all day and maybe tomorrow. Back on the move, we decide to go to the other side of the mall to La Madeleine. We order a salad and half sandwich each \u2014 not the brunch we hoped for but we are so hungry we don't even care.  $9.94 Advertisement 11 a.m. \u2014 Now we are ready to shop! We hit Anthropologie since it is closest. We see a sign that all home stuff is on sale and proceed to smell every candle in the place. I decide on my favorite, \"Volcano,\" and check out. She buys a cute ring tray and candle. We walk around the mall stopping and looking in stores and end up at Sephora. Sephora is having a sale and I have a list of things I want. We go through the entire store grabbing what we want. I grab a Natasha Denona pallet that I have been eyeing but couldn't justify paying full price for, primer, hair oil, a clay mask, and a bronzer kit. We pay and go to Lush so my BFF can grab some things. I decide to get stocking stuffers for my sister since we are there: bath bombs are some of her favorite things. Next is Aerie for undies; they are having a sale too, so I buy a few pairs. BFF gets some too, and with sore feet, we head to our next adventure.  $451.74 3 p.m. \u2014 We drive next to the nail salon, basically a tradition for us. My dip is still looking fresh so I opt for a nice pedicure; BFF gets a mani and a pedi. Mine is a six-step pearl pedi that smells amazing! However, the old man next to me literally won't stop farting, and it's seriously so nasty! The BFF and I catch up on her boyfriend, life, and everything else that has happened in the six months since we saw each other last.  $70 Advertisement 4 p.m. \u2014 By the time we are done at the nail salon we realize we are hungry again. We walk to a taco shop that is having happy hour. The place is totally empty and only one lady is working aside from the kitchen staff. We sit at the bar and it takes a while for her to get to us, but when she finally does I get a skinny margarita and chicken taco; BFF gets a house margarita and a taco, and we order chips to split. We sit and talk for a while, long enough for her to order another marg and me another taco. I don't know what it is, but I am starving! Hubby calls and says he is leaving work early so we agree to meet him back at home soon.  $18.14 6 p.m. \u2014 We get home and hubby has already eaten leftovers for dinner. BFF and I don't want food so we decide to see what's on Netflix and relax. (We share an account with my parents and don't pay anything for it.) We put on  Bachelorette , which is surprisingly funny, make some drinks, and partially through the movie, Hubby and BFF decide to raid the fridge and pantry and share cheese and Oreos. I'm still so full from tacos so I pass. 11:45 p.m. \u2014 I'm falling asleep on the sofa as we all watch episodes of  Family Guy . I decide to go to bed and Hubby and BFF stay up talking.

But we're going to our college's football game and it's basically the whole reason my BFF is in town. We have a tradition in which we always go to this particular game together. We both rush to get ready and pack up the car with tailgate essentials. On the way to the stadium, we stop at Chick-Fil-A for a quick breakfast.  $4.97 9:30 a.m. \u2014 We arrive at the stadium, find our tailgating spot, set up our chairs, and pop a bottle of Mo\u00ebt for mimosas. It is pretty cold out, so we just sit and talk and drink. Once it gets closer to game time, we decide to find our seats. The game is going great, we score in the first 15 seconds of the game; by halftime, we're still winning. We decide to beat the halftime concession stand rush and split a few minutes early. Pizza is calling our names. It's highway robbery, how much you have to pay for food at sporting events, but what are you gonna do?  $17 3 p.m. \u2014 We go home after the game is over. Hubby is working on a project for work and BFF and I sit around talking. Hubby joins us and asks what our plans are for the night. Apparently, when we were drunk-watching  Bachelorette  last night, we decided that going to a strip club would be a good idea. Since my brother-in-law is now old enough to go to one, I had the bright idea of saying we should take him. We do some research to decide on a place and make plans. BFF and I change outfits and I throw on a more daring lipstick for the night. Advertisement 7:30 p.m. \u2014 We go out for hibachi (one of my favorites!) at dinnertime! Brother-in-law (BIL) is meeting us at dinner, so we sit at the bar and have drinks until he arrives. Since it is still happy hour, BFF and I get a martini each and hubby gets his usual. The bartender is cool and gives us alcohol-soaked gummy bears that are surprisingly good. We grab a table when BIL arrives I am due for another drink. I am totally feeling the first one, especially because of all the gummy bears I ate. Everyone orders food and more drinks, and we have a great time \u2014 and end up very full. Hubby pays the tab for all of us and we go back home so that BIL can drop off his car at our house before our adventure. 9:30 p.m. \u2014 We get to the strip club, and Hubby again pays for everyone. We go inside and a waitress leads us to a table and brings us some pitchers of Coke since it is BYOB and we have almost a full bottle of whiskey. Hubby gives us some singles and we enjoy the show. Since it is still somewhat early we are getting a lot of attention. BIL is in total shock since this is his first time. We get a couple of girls to come over to him and it is honestly the highlight of the night. We enjoy the drinks and the show when BIL notices a girl that is more his type. Hubby asks her to come over and pays for BIL to get two private dances; you can tell he is nervous but he follows her to the back room. The three of us proceed to watch some seriously talented girls: one is basically G.I. Jane and can climb that pole! BIL comes back and we keep at it; at this point the place is packed and we are all close to hitting our limit; plus, it is after 1 a.m. at this point. We pay our waitress and leave.

I am super dehydrated from all the booze last night and order a Pellegrino; Hubby and BFF get mimosas. I want brunch food, but I opt for a chicken sandwich since I feel like I need protein and I don't care for eggs. BFF follows suit while Hubby gets a breakfast burrito. Brunch is so good, and exactly what I needed. I offer to pay since Hubby paid for everything last night. Our favorite waiter reminds us that we get $10 off for signing up for their points card. I end up giving him $10 tip just for that.  $47.89 12:30 p.m. \u2014 It is time for BFF to leave. We help her load up her car and say our goodbyes. I'm sad to see her go, but happy for a little quiet time. Kitty is low on food and litter so I run down the road to the pet store. I get talked into buying a different food that is the same price, but half the size. I give it a try because I want my babies to be well taken care of. I grab some kitty litter and remember we are out of paper towels; I run into the store next door and get those.  $37.87 Advertisement 1:30 p.m. \u2014 The rest of the day is about house chores: laundry, dishes, etc., followed by a two-hour nap. 6 p.m. \u2014 I don't feel so great after we wake up from our naps. The lack of sleep and alcohol are taking their toll on me. Hubby and I decide to snuggle on the sofa and watch TV.

I can successfully avoid everyone at the office until after lunch; it's the one perk of working in such a small office. I prep for a few big meetings I have this week for most of the day. After, I break for a quick meeting with my boss, followed by an extremely uncomfortable meeting with our creative team.

I don't like the colors and it makes my eyes itch. I remind myself to do some online shopping when I get to work since today is the last day of the Sephora sale. I leave for work with my protein shake. 9 a.m. \u2014 No one is really at work yet, so I hide in my office and surf the Sephora site. I end up rationalizing a few more purchases since they are 20% off and I need to buy gifts for Christmas. (I am attempting to get all my Christmas shopping done early this year.) I buy concealer, a skincare set, eyelashes, and setting spray for me; and perfume for mom and sister, plus cologne for Hubby.  $256.33 12:30 p.m. \u2014 Just finished a meeting with a vendor and my boss, and I run out to a local Chinese place for lunch. I hate where my office is because there is a small selection of food; usually this makes me bring my lunch, but no such luck this week. Hubby and I text while I eat my orange chicken.  $9.74 Advertisement 1:30 p.m. \u2014 While texting my husband, the topic of Christmas gifts come up and somehow the subject turns to cologne. He informs me that he no longer likes the cologne which, unbeknownst to him, I just purchased. I hit the Sephora site again and buy the one he likes; looks like I have two returns to make now. I check my bank account and see that an order I placed last month finally got billed; I totally forgot about that purchase.  $126.02 3 p.m. \u2014 My meetings are done for the day; all I need to do is finish one project for a meeting tomorrow and I am good! My boss usually leaves early on Wednesdays so I sneak out a little early too. I get home with slightly less traffic than usual and try to figure out what to make for dinner. Hubby opts for leftover burrito bowls and I heat up soup. The only thing I like about winter is the weather being chilly enough for soup. Other than that, I HATE the cold! 9 p.m. \u2014 Soup is starting to wear off so I munch on Goldfish while we watch a little TV and unwind from the day. Hubby is working on his side project and I'm starting to fall asleep. I decide to call it a night.

Slowly meander downstairs and make myself a latte with almond milk and my breakfast staple: oatmeal with peanut butter, bananas, and pomegranate seeds. It's so good! One of my roommates is also up and we start an episode of  The Sinner . We started watching last week and can't stop. It's a great crime thriller that is full of twists and turns. 12 p.m. \u2014 Having a lazy day and the roommate and I decide to do a puzzle. We venture out to Target and pick up a Christmas-themed, 1,000-piece puzzle. She buys and I'll Venmo her for half, or pick up the next puzzle.

This is one of my favorite groups to get together with, and it's always a guaranteed good time. We sneak in a couple of whiskey shots. 10:30 p.m. \u2014 We head out to a dive karaoke bar in our neighborhood. We've been regulars here for the past five years and it's one of the best spots in NE. It's packed so we can't find a table and opt for the bar instead. We order a round of drinks and a round of \u201cVegas Bomb\u201d shots and we all toss in cash to cover. It looks like it's going to be an hour and a half wait to get in for karaoke so we decide to move on.  $20 11:15 p.m. \u2014 We head to another great dive bar that's only a few blocks away. We split a few more pitchers of beer and nachos. My roommate throws the drinks and food on her card \u2014 she'll send out a Venmo for my portion later.

I don't have a lot of grad school homework this weekend so I'm okay with taking it easy. Next weekend, I have a huge project due so I won't have much downtime. I heat up leftover rice pilaf I have in the fridge from last week. 5 p.m. \u2014 We finished the puzzle and  The Sinner ; I'd consider that a productive day. It's a \u201cuse up what's in the fridge\u201d kind of day, so I make myself an egg salad using the last of my groceries.

Advertisement 8:10 a.m. \u2014 I head into work (a few minutes late) and respond to missed emails from the weekend while I eat my oatmeal. I usually keep breakfast ingredients in the fridge and at my desk so I always have food on hand for the morning. It's going to be a busy day; I have a full day of interviews with candidates scheduled. I like meeting with people and it helps the day go by faster. 9:30 a.m. \u2014 My roommate and I talk about going to  The Disaster Artist  tonight. We're big into Oscar season and try to see all of the movies that are getting Oscar buzz. It's showing at Uptown Theater and probably won't go to wide-release so I buy us two tickets ahead of time.  $22 12 p.m. \u2014 Lunchtime! I usually eat with my team and we have a caf\u00e9 in our building that does soups, salads, sandwiches etc. It's perfect for days like today where I'm running low on groceries. I end up ordering a grilled cheese sandwich and fruit. I tend to eat much healthier when I don't eat out, oh well.  $5.57 4 p.m. \u2014 Head home for the day. I'm definitely glad the Monday workday is over. I do homework and reheat more lentil soup. I've been eating this for six days but I still have a lot left. Figuring out portions for one person can be a struggle sometimes. 7:15 p.m. \u2014 Head to the movie with my roommate and I buy us popcorn to share. This is one of my favorite theaters to see movies at and this movie does not disappoint! James Franco gives quite the performance and we're laughing out loud for the entire movie.

It rained and snowed all last night and the temps are now below freezing, so the roads will be pretty unsafe. Because of that, most people are working from home. I don't live far from the office so I decide to go in. 8:30 a.m. \u2014 It took me an additional 30 minutes to get to work (a lot for my short commute) and I'm one of the only people in the office. I actually have a lot to do and have a very productive morning because there is no one around to chat with or be distracted by. I'm not super hungry so I grab a few Wasa crackers I have in my desk and top them with avocado. 11:45 a.m. \u2014 I'm starving at this point and decide to order from Urban Sub because they deliver. I get my favorite vegetarian wrap, which is super delicious. I try to eat meat-free during the week unless I go out. I browse my favorite daily news sites while I eat and am thoroughly enjoying the office being so quiet.  $10.16 2 p.m. \u2014 I decide to go home to avoid the evening traffic because the roads are still pretty bad. The ride home is treacherous and I'm glad to finish the day from the warmth of my living room. I got paid today, so I transfer $1,000 into my savings account. I get a commission check once a month and I've been putting it all away for when I'm a full-time intern next year. I'll be unemployed for the better part of a year, so I've been saving for a while now. Advertisement 4 p.m. \u2014 My roommates are busy tonight, which is good because I have errands to run. I'm completely out of food and I'd usually go to Trader Joe's, but there isn't one near the other places I have to stop. I settle for Cub and get stuff for curry: chickpeas, zucchini, onion, sweet potatoes, garlic, coconut curry sauce and rice, as well as English muffins and avocados for breakfast.  $32.13 4:30 p.m. \u2014 I head over to Target to grab Christmas candy, more Christmas lights, and some of my skincare and makeup necessities. Last stop is Home Depot to look at Christmas trees. We don't have room for a big one, and they don't have many real little ones, so I settle on a five-foot fake tree that's pretty cute. Checked a lot of my list tonight!  $82.91 6:30 p.m. \u2014 I head home and make the curry; it's hearty, delicious and a nice break from the lentil soup. One of my roommates comes home and we spend time listening to Christmas tunes and decorating our townhouse. I love this time of year and how festive the weather makes it feel. 8:30 p.m. \u2014 We watch last night's episode of  The Voice  on Hulu and make popcorn. I crawl into bed around 10.

I heat up leftover chickpea curry and snack on the popcorn and cookies that someone brought in for the movie. 4:30 p.m. \u2014 Head home and finish an assignment that is due today. Luckily, it's a lighter assignment and doesn't take much time at all. I usually have two, four-credit classes each quarter, but one of my classes ended after six weeks instead of 10. The lighter workload is just what I need closer to the holidays. 7:30 p.m. \u2014 My roommate volunteers at U.S. Bank Stadium during Vikings games and they're doing a volunteer holiday appreciation event tonight where he can invite a few guests. They're showing  Elf  on the big screens and everyone sets up on blankets picnic style on the field. The vendors are selling select items for a reduced price, so I grab a hot dog and eat some of the complimentary popcorn and water.  $1.50 10:30 p.m. \u2014 Go home and to bed.

The only annoying thing about living with roommates is the timing of getting ready in the morning, and that I share my bathroom with a guy. Oh well. I make a latte in the meantime. Advertisement 8 a.m. \u2014 I get into work and there is a hot chocolate bar set up in the break room. I help myself to a coffee/hot chocolate mixture and make an English muffin with almond butter. I have interviews until lunch so it will be a busy morning. 12 p.m. \u2014 For lunch, I heat up my leftover chickpea curry and eat in the caf\u00e9 downstairs with my coworkers. I welcome the much-needed break. When I get back, I send out an email about supplies we need for our holiday volunteering event. We're donating necessity baskets to an organization that helps homeless youth and I'm glad to be leading the efforts. 5 p.m. \u2014 I run to grab happy hour with a couple of girlfriends. I normally wouldn't be out every night, especially considering my school workload, but it seems like everyone tries to catch up before the holidays and I try to make time for friends I haven't seen in a while. We go to a new spot, in my neighborhood which was converted from an old strip club. I have a signature rum cocktail and a glass of white wine. We split small plates of crispy rice, mango salad, and egg rolls. The food was really good and I can't wait to come back for dinner sometime.  $26.88 7:30 p.m. \u2014 My roommate and I say our goodbyes and head to a friend's place for dinner. My friend and his girlfriend invited us over and we couldn't pass up the opportunity for someone to cook for us. I grab beers from our fridge for us to share.

Nice way to break up a Friday!  $23.89 7 p.m. \u2014 My roommates and I have been planning to go bowling at one of our favorite spots for a while now. It's definitely not a family bowling kind of place, and the drinks are usually flowing. A few other friends meet us and we have dinner before we bowl. We grab a bunch of bar apps to share and I'm digging the cheese curds; we also split a few pitchers of beer. My friend grabs the bill \u2014 which he does not need to do! \u2014 so my roommates and I whisper and plan to cover bowling for everyone.

I don't usually sing, but my friends are pretty entertaining to watch. I'm definitely enjoying tonight, although I'm sure I'll regret the drinks in the morning considering my oncoming cold.

My driver is super nice and chatty and plays cool Jamaican music that makes me feel like I'm on a tropical island and not in gloomy SF. It takes 26 minutes to get to my destination in the beautiful Presidio. ($7.87 reimbursed) 12:26 p.m. \u2014 I wanted to be dropped off at the nearby Starbucks, but it turns out the area is a cluster of office buildings and Starbucks is in this cluster. A bit confusing for me and my Lyft driver. I really only wanted to use the restroom to freshen up, so I pop in and hope no baristas tell me the restroom is for customers only. Advertisement 12:35 p.m. \u2014 This is a really, really nice area. The commute would suck if I was offered this position and accepted, but I can see the Palace of Fine Arts from the bench by the lake and wow. Breathtaking. 12:50 p.m. \u2014 I make my way to the office only to find out I'm completely lost. I have a horrible sense of direction so the map doesn't even help. I eventually find the building but alas, I have entered from the wrong side. I panic because I'm always early, especially to interviews, but I can't find the security guard from whom I am supposed to get a visitor's badge. Thankfully, I find it with a few minutes to spare and he tells me the office is just a few steps away. I breathe a sigh of relief and enter my interview. 3 p.m. \u2014 Fini! I think the interview went pretty well, and I actually really enjoyed talking to the team members. I was hoping this wouldn't happen because the commute would play a huge role in my decision if I'm fortunate enough to get offered the job. One of the women I was supposed to meet with today went home sick, and they asked me to come back to meet her. Thankfully, I have another interview in the city next Tuesday so I agree to stop by then. 3:15 p.m. \u2014 I scheduled a phone interview after this onsite. This was a reschedule, so I wanted to do it as soon as she was available. It lasted 30 minutes longer than I thought it would ... and I was sitting outside on a bench the entire time. It was hard to keep my papers from getting blown away and hearing her with the bustle of traffic hour. Advertisement 4:09 p.m. \u2014 Another Lyft line from another exciting Lyft driver. He yells my name as soon as I open the car door as if we're best friends who haven't seen each other in years. I love it. He talks to me about odors in Lyfts, how they come about, and how drivers should handle them. ($4.83 reimbursed) 5:15 p.m. \u2014 By the time I get back to my car, I'm FAMISHED and craving a McChicken sandwich from McDonald's. I text my boyfriend, M., to inform him of my desire, and he encourages me to get one as a reward for interviewing. I happily oblige and pull up to the McDonald's drive-through about five minutes away. I eat it so fast, I don't even get to savor the tastes.  $1.09 6:15 p.m. \u2014 Finally home! What a day. I wonder how I'll deal if I get a job in the city and I have to do a similar commute every day... My mom made seafood and tofu dishes that are very comforting. I'm leaving to go to Chicago with M. and two other couple-friends early tomorrow morning, so I pack after dinner. I don't feel great going on a trip while unemployed, but it would be costlier to cancel at this point. Daily Total: $17.47", "day_two": "Day Two: 4:40 a.m. \u2014 Blah, our flight is at 6:30 a.m. so my boyfriend and his dad are picking me up at 5. I check one last time to make sure I have everything, change, and head out the door. My mom wakes up and hands me a red envelope to wish me safe travels. She does this every time I travel somewhere; super sweet! Advertisement 5:15 a.m. \u2014 We arrive at SJC and get through TSA quickly because M. and I have TSA Precheck. It's free with our Sapphire Reserve cards, but I think I would pay for it regardless. I hate waiting in lines, especially unpredictable ones. We make our way to the lounge because we both have the Priority Pass, another Sapphire Reserve perk. I munch on a few hard-boiled eggs doused with Tabasco, and half a peanut butter and honey bagel, while M. devours yogurt and fruit. We both drink copious amounts of OJ. All the food and drinks (including alcohol) are free in the lounge! 6 a.m. \u2014 As we make our way to our gate, we hear our names being called. Boarding only started 10 minutes ago, but I guess Alaska Airlines is super punctual because they're already starting to call names for people who are \u201clate\u201d to board. We're two of the last people on the jet, so they changed our seats and we're no longer sitting near our friends. 8:30 a.m. \u2014 Touchdown in Seattle for our short layover. I hunt for food because I'm ravenous and know I won't be eating until 4 p.m. Chicago time. I get in a super-long line for a jalape\u00f1o cheddar bagel breakfast sandwich which was satisfying, but I wish the bagel had more jalape\u00f1os. I eat half and wrap up the other half to eat during the flight. (Of course, I end up eating the rest of the sandwich five minutes later.)  $8.79 Advertisement 4 p.m. \u2014 WE MADE IT. I was afraid there would be delays due to the weather, but we got lucky! Taking a Lyft for six people would cost around $60 and an hour's time, but public transportation cost half that price for the same amount of time, so we opt for transit. I get CTA passes for the group to speed things along ($30). I'll add this to Splitwise (super helpful app that syncs with Venmo) to get paid back later by my friends.  $5 6 p.m. \u2014 After a successful train ride and a bus fail (we were going in the wrong direction), we decide to hail a Lyft to get to our Airbnb. I do the duty and snag one that only comes to $22.14. Add to Splitwise. We all change and brace for the cold (it's seven degrees outside).  $3.36 7:30 p.m. \u2014 We have reservations at Girl & The Goat at 9:15, but we are all famished from a day of traveling so we head to The Pizza Parlor about a block away for appetizers. We get nachos, fried calamari, fries, and a pretty strong punch bowl to share. The Queen of Clumsy, a.k.a. me, knocks over her first glass of punch. All of the food was really good, especially the nachos. It comes on a platter of individual portions of nachos, so each bite had all the toppings. My friend picks up the tab and adds it to Splitwise.  $22.98 8:30 p.m. \u2014 We head to a bar across the street called The Fox Bar. I don't get anything because the 1.5 cups of punch I had already got me a little buzzed. (I am lightweight.) The bar is incredibly intimate with lots of character; I wish we had bars like this back home. The men get seasonal drinks and we all join in on a game of HQ. We make it to question eight before we lose. Advertisement 8:50 p.m. \u2014 A couple of my friends love alcohol so we head to another bar/restaurant upstairs in the same building called The Allis. Very bourgie. The waiter takes too long helping other patrons, so we have to leave after a few glasses of water. Can't miss Girl & The Goat! 9:15 p.m. \u2014 OMG I'm so excited. I looked at reservations two months in advance, and there were only two left for the weekend we were going. I booked both time slots because again, I'm anal and couldn't risk missing out. 10:30 p.m. \u2014 Wow, that was so good. So good. The restaurant is tapas-style and many of their dishes feature goat. (Go figure.) We ordered 10 for the six of us to share, and it was the perfect amount. Some of my favorites were the goat and chorizo pizza, goat empanadas, scallops, and the pig face (get this dish!). I highly recommend this restaurant, but you probably have to book a couple of months in advance. M. foots the bill of $234.15 and we split on Splitwise.  $39.02 11 p.m. \u2014 We walk in the frigid temperatures to Three Dots and a Dash, an underground tiki bar that we probably wouldn't have found without the help of a homeless man. Very cool bar, but how do Chicagoans deal with wearing all these winter coats, scarves, beanies, and gloves and constantly having to take them off and put them back on?! Freezing outside, then hot inside. I'm spoiled by California weather. Anyways, I get a really good drink but I don't remember what it's called. It was served in a totem pole!  $20 Advertisement 12:30 a.m. \u2014 Back to our super cute Airbnb. The only downside is there's only one bathroom, something we didn't realize until after we booked this spot. Showers all around and a few competitive rounds of Taboo later, we all return to our respective rooms. I then proceeded to KTFO. First night in Chicago and I'm lovin' it already! Daily Total: $99.15", "day_three": "Day Three: 9:15 a.m. \u2014 We're out the door and it's one degree outside. My body doesn't know how to handle this. Walk to the transit station since it's only a few minutes away. M. foots the day passes for everyone, and someone makes racist comments to my group (we're all Asian) while we wait for the train. It's hard just standing there and taking it, but some people are ignorant and don't deserve my time of day.  $10 9:45 a.m. \u2014 We make it to Wildberry Cafe near Millenium Park. I get the Slow Roasted Brisket Hash, and OMG, droooool. I'm not a big fan of breakfast food, but that was probably one of the best breakfasts I've ever had. The portions are MASSIVE, but M. and I annihilate that thing. He gets a veggie-filled omelet, but I think I can confidently declare my choice supreme.  $19.78 11 a.m. \u2014 Backtrack to Ross a block away since my friends need thicker socks and a beanie. Head over to Millennium Park after since it's across the street. Didn't know the Bean was here, but hooray for randomly crossing off a touristy destination! Advertisement 11:30 a.m. \u2014 Coffee break at Goddess Caf\u00e9. M. and I actually get tea because we're not big coffee drinkers ($3 to M.). The perfect solution to another cold day. Hop into a Lyft ($2.15 for my share) to go to the Field Museum!  $5.15 12 p.m. \u2014 Okay, The Field Museum is insanely extensive and I couldn't even see all the exhibits before tapping out. There are LOTS of things to see here (animals, history, science, and more), and for $20 (student pricing), it's well worth it. Struggled again with managing my winter gear. I ended up sweating a lot.  $20 3 p.m. \u2014 Thankfully, the Shedd Aquarium is right next door so we waddle on over. Why is admission $20 more for out-of-state visitors?! Very cool aquarium regardless \u2014 but I'm not sure if it beats Monterey Bay Aquarium.  $40 5 p.m. \u2014 I'm all museum-ed and aquarium-ed out. Starving again. Hop on a Lyft to Portillo's ($4.49 for my share) to get a hot dog because Chicago. M. and I got two Chicago-style dogs and a regular fries to share. It's a very solid hot dog, but nothing special. They're also pretty small. Or maybe I'm just really hungry?  $8.49 6 p.m. \u2014 Stop by Walgreens across the street to pick up a few gallons of water since our Airbnb only provides old milk. I also get hand warmers because gloves just aren't cutting it. We see a puffy little boy in a stroller who resembles the Michelin Man, and I just about melt from cuteness. M. pays. Advertisement 7:30 p.m. \u2014 Back at our Airbnb thanks to another Lyft ($6.02 for my share). Got ready to head out again, then made our way to Gus' Fried Chicken. We got a 16-piece meal for four of us to share, a four-piece tender meal for the other two, mac and cheese, baked beans, potato salad, and coleslaw. Oh, and sweet tea for everyone! Stupid-sweet but highly addictive. I love fried chicken, but Gus' only serves spicy fried chicken and I wish it was spicier ($16.04).  $22.06 9 p.m. \u2014 My friend made reservations at a super unique but pricey bar called The Aviary. The experience is unparalleled, but I'm not a big drinker so I don't know if I would go back and pay those prices again. My drinks weren't bad, but I don't think I appreciate alcohol enough to love their cocktail options. Regardless, if you get a chance, go for the experience. All of their food is enough for one person only, but my two girlfriends and I shared this matcha ice cream dessert. So yum.  $59 11 p.m. \u2014 We meet up with our friend's cousins who live in Chicago ($3.15 for Lyft), and they bring us to the Navigator Taproom. Cool spot with poppin' music. I want to dance so badly but I am shy and it is a taproom. I'm already buzzed at this point, so I opt out of alcohol again. There were so many beers and ciders I wanted to try! I did indulge in free popcorn though.  $3.15 Advertisement 12 a.m. \u2014 We walk to a bar down the street and all the Christmas lights dangling from the ceiling reminded me of  Stranger Things . More poppin' music, but at least I get to dance this time! I definitely feel extremely Bay Area because my friends and I dance like we would at home but everyone else is just \u2026 standing there. Unsurprisingly, it's hard to dance with a coat, scarf, and beanie on. We leave after less than half an hour for late-night ramen! 12:30 a.m. \u2014 The friend who has cousins in Chi is drunk at this point. I find it low-key hilarious because this is his girlfriend's first time seeing him on this level and she is not having it. (They have been dating for about four months.) Still, he is having the time of his life with his family and that's all that really matters, right? We go to Furious Spoon for ramen and you guessed it, more alcohol. M. and I get the Furious ramen to share, and it is pretty good for a ramen joint that probably serves drunkards. I pay.  $17.24 1:30 a.m. \u2014 We hail a Lyft back to our Airbnb ($2.94). Drunk friend throws up all his ramen and we see it frozen on the ground the next morning. M. and I chat for a while about traveling in a group, especially with three couples. We're all at different stages in our relationships and it's interesting to see the dynamics between each couple. Most of us have been friends for years though, so nothing is too new.  $2.94 Advertisement 4 a.m. \u2014 I get up to pee and my friend, who has been summoned to the couch per his girlfriend's adamant demand, scares the shit out of me because he pops up like a zombie from his sleep. M., my other friend, and I try to get him to drink water. Our efforts are futile. Daily Total: $207.81", "day_four": "Day Four: 11 a.m. \u2014 It's our last full day in Chicago. One thing I don't enjoy about traveling in groups is that everyone wakes up at different times. M. and I are early birds, and when we travel, we stick to that schedule so we can take advantage of our time in a new city. It's a little frustrating, but what can you do? On a brighter note, we call a Lyft to head to Eataly for lunch!  $3.51 12:30 p.m. \u2014 So. Much. Italian. food. We chose four pastas and a pizza for lunch in the upstairs restaurant. My expectations were too high, but I was still happy. My friend drunkenly left his camera at The Aviary the previous night, but I picked it up in secret. We try to ride out not telling him for as long as possible, but after lunch, we spill the beans and even get the waiter in on the prank. We have several hearty laughs, and I my friend treats me to pistachio and coffee gelato. Thanks, buddy!  $20.89 1 p.m. \u2014 Get a four-pack of adorably tiny pastries from the stand next to the gelato. So delectable. Only four out of the six of us are up for the chilly challenge of trekking to the Skydeck, which takes about half an hour. Lucky for me, majority rules. I prefer walking when I can to take in the scenic views and really get to experience the city!  $6.47 Advertisement 1:30 p.m. \u2014 Skydeck's lines are so long and it is so, so hot in there. As a roller coaster enthusiast, I thought I was set with heights forever. That was true until I stepped onto the Ledge at the Skydeck. Never again. At least our pictures are cute. I also witnessed a proposal! My heart.  $24 3 p.m. \u2014 We find a photo booth near the Skydeck's gift shop! M. and I hop in after our friends. He charges it to his card. 3:30 p.m. \u2014 Lyft over to Lincoln Park Zoo to check out the few animals that can survive in the winter as well as their Zoo Lights. I love that this zoo is open 365 days a year and admission is free!  $4 5:15 p.m. \u2014 Lyft to Pequod's Pizzeria ($2.39)! I'm stoked because I love pizza but have been a fan of thin crust my whole life. I was lucky enough to snag reservations at 6 p.m. a few weeks earlier, but I wasn't sure if that meant we just got priority wait times or we actually had reservations. We get there about 20 minutes early, and ended up getting seated at 6 p.m.!  $2.39 7 p.m. \u2014 We order a deep-dish pizza (sausage, pepperoni, and garlic on half), but that thing takes 45 minutes and I pretty much inhale it when it came. The friends who didn't want garlic quickly realized their mistake. I'm a strong believer in garlic making everything better. Pequod's definitely lived up to the hype for me!  $6.21 Advertisement 8 p.m. \u2014 Tonight was declared munchies night because it was our last night in Chicago. Lyft to Crisp for Korean fried chicken.  $2.75 8:15 p.m. \u2014 Man, this place is tiny AF. There's nowhere to stand and I spin in circles moving around for everyone. We order five wings for the six of us to share since we only wanted to try it. Very yummy food in a very, very cramped space.  $2.39 9 p.m. \u2014 Next stop: Honey Butter Fried Chicken. Sadly, I don't love this place. It's a modern twist on classic southern fried chicken, but I'll stick with the original.  $4.42 9:40 p.m. \u2014 Hop off a Lyft ($4.09) and into Mindy's Hot Chocolate. To my surprise, it is a sit-down restaurant with a 45 to 60-minute wait, so we get three old-fashioned hot chocolates to-go (one per couple). So good! It tastes like a real chocolate bar was melted to become a delicacy. So satisfying on a cold Chicago night. I pay for our hot chocolate ($12.16).  $16.25 10 p.m. \u2014 Last stop of the night: Small Cheval. We had plans to go to the famous Au Cheval, but they were closed due to renovations. Bummer. Thankfully, Small Cheval doesn't disappoint! I'm utterly stuffed at this point, but I have the mentality of eating as much as I can in a new city. The four of us get a cheeseburger and fries to share, and I wish that was one of our actual meals. I would've been so content eating a full cheeseburger and order of fries myself. They basically have garlic aioli on tap. If Small Cheval is this good, I wonder how Au Cheval tastes.  $4.75 Advertisement 11 p.m. \u2014 Lyft back to the Airbnb ($4). Everyone was too tired to hit up one last bar, so we opted for a movie night instead. Started with  How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days  and ended with  The Little Rascals . To be honest, that was the perfect way to end our trip.  $4 Daily Total: $102.03", "day_five": "Day Five: 11 a.m. \u2014 Check out of our Airbnb and take a Lyft to Wasabi for ramen.  $7.61 12 p.m. \u2014 M. and I share the spicy black garlic ramen (must try!) and a wagyu beef rice bowl. We also ordered a takoyaki to share with the whole table, and they accidentally send us a second order out and tell us to keep it!  $22.79 12:30 p.m. \u2014 Lyft to O'Hare airport. Until next time, Chi-beria!  $2.46 5:30 p.m. \u2014 We land in SEA again for a layover, and I'm desperately craving clam chowder. Thankfully, there's a restaurant near our gate that sells it. M. pays while I dash to the restroom. 8 p.m. \u2014 Back in San Jose. My parents pick us up, and I'm disappointed that my puppy isn't in the car. Drop off M., who lives three minutes away, and make my way home to be greeted by my overly-excited pup! 9 p.m. \u2014 I knock out. Traveling is tough. Daily Total: $32.86", "day_six": "Day Six: 8 a.m. \u2014 Wake up to take my pup out. He's an eight-month-old Terrier mix and we adopted him last summer after our old dog passed away the previous year. I love having a dog in my life. 2 p.m. \u2014 I finally get to try on a pair of booties from Urban Outfitters and a pair of heels from ASOS that arrived while I was in Chicago \u2014 both of which I got on sale. The booties are painfully uncomfortable, and the heels are not my style after all. At least that means I will get $65 back. 5 p.m. \u2014 Spent a good chunk of my day trying to prepare for another onsite interview tomorrow. I got distracted and freak out when I realize the time and see I h've barely gotten anything done. I resort to doing laundry and choosing my interview outfit. 11 p.m. \u2014 Sleep time.

I've only been applying to companies in the city because there are more creative options there. The commute is not ideal, but I have a better chance of finding a job I'll love. 9:30 a.m. \u2014 Head out to the South Fremont/Warm Springs BART station today because it's closer. Fare and parking come out to $17.50 but it's reimbursed by my Reserve card ($17.50). I still have my brand new umbrella because it actually did not rain last week. 11 a.m. \u2014 I arrive in SF, and it turns out the office is near the Pier! I'm really hitting all the offices in prime locations. I'm early (as usual) and a bit hungry, so I walk to a Starbucks close to the office for a croissant and a restroom break.  $2.45 11:45 a.m. \u2014 Interview time! I really liked the people, but I end up not advancing in the interview process. I'm okay though because their reasoning is something I am not surprised by, and the hiring manager told me I am a high performer and wants to stay connected. Plus one for a networking opportunity. 1:20 p.m. \u2014 I have a little over an hour and a half to kill before my next interview, so I walk over to Onigilly and get a rice bowl.  $11.91 2:15 p.m. \u2014 Lyft line over to the next interview. ($5.92 reimbursed) 3:30 p.m. \u2014 The hiring manager allocated an hour for this interview, but we end up chatting for only half an hour. I felt better about speaking with the team members last week than I did with today's manager. I'm nervous because she is the one I would report to, so I'm not sure how this will turn out. Fingers crossed. Lyft to the Embarcadero BART station. I really wanted to get a burrito from El Farolito, but I remind myself of everything I ate in Chicago and focus on getting home ASAP. ($7.24 reimbursed) 5:15 p.m. \u2014 I am home and go straight for the food. I eat my mom's feast of a pork and egg dish, another red pork dish, green beans, and ginger soup since a couple people in my family are sick. I was planning to complete a skills assessment test tomorrow, but I start working on it after I eat dinner to get it out of the way. I start to feel a bit down and worry that I won't get to move forward with that position, so I start maniacally applying to jobs. 8:30 p.m. \u2014 I texted M. earlier about wanting to get boba, so when I tell him I finished the assessment early, he asks if I want to go celebrate. I pick him up for boba nearby and get a yogurt green tea. M. pays for the drinks, but I end up wanting a snack and getting fried squid rings. It's a great deal because it's happy hour!  $4.34 10 p.m. \u2014 Get home, shower, nightly skincare routine, in bed by 10:30. Good night, world.

I brew a pot of coffee on Sunday nights and stick it in the fridge for a whole week. It's not an ideal system, but I prefer it 100 times more than fresh hot coffee. 7:50 a.m. \u2014 I'm out the door. Luckily, I both live and work downtown, so it's a 10-minute walk into the hospital. I like to jam out on the way there; today, it's Arcade Fire's newest album. 8:05 a.m. \u2014 I get to work early and talk to the security guard about my weekend; it's our Monday tradition. She teases me for staying in St. Pete this weekend. I traveled a lot this summer and there's a running joke between us now that I'm \"always going somewhere.\" 8:30 a.m. \u2014 I'm a coffee fiend and usually cave to the coffee shop in our hospital on Monday mornings. I'm going to Nashville with friends in a couple of weeks, so I'm trying not to waste my money on coffee. One of my coworkers brings me a coffee without me asking because she is an angel. Advertisement 12 p.m. \u2014 I meal prep for the whole week during the weekend, so I usually have all of my lunches and dinners made in advance. This saves me money and ensures that I eat clean for most of the week. For lunch today, I have a sriracha, garlic, and honey pork chop with diced sweet potatoes and asparagus. 5:15 p.m. \u2014 Done with work. I walk back and talk to my mom on the phone. Back at home, I immediately scarf down homemade peanut butter granola. I eat enough to make it a not-healthy snack anymore. 6:15 p.m. \u2014 I hit up a barre class. My studio gives me a student discount and I go enough to make it a great deal. 7:45 p.m. \u2014 Back from barre, I eat dinner: zucchini noodles with carrots, onions, and peppers in red sauce. I watch two lectures for school, text my boyfriend for a little bit, and later snack on homemade chocolate chip cookies that my Dad sent me.

($170, covered by my mom) 12 p.m. \u2014 I eat my leftover zucchini noodles from last night and have lots of yummy red sauce left over, so I buy a piece of grilled chicken from the cafeteria to finish it off. It's $3.18, but payroll deducted. I also eat some blueberries, blackberries, and strawberries that I packed.  $3.18 12:40 p.m. \u2014 I'm trying SO hard not to spend money on coffee, but I literally just fell asleep at my desk. Halfway to walking to the hospital coffee shop, I remember we have a lone K-cup in the office cabinet. I turn around and go back; it's good for me to get the steps anyway. Advertisement 3 p.m. \u2014 The surgeon I work for hits the proverbial wall and is in desperate need of caffeine. He asks if anyone wants anything from the coffee shop and takes me with him because I'm the only one who can remember everyone's order. I get a double espresso. 5:15 p.m. \u2014 Done with patients and drive to a hot yoga class. I started doing yoga at my barre studio when I sent out my applications to medical school. I was so anxious that I stopped sleeping, and it's helped a lot so far. 7:30 p.m. \u2014 Back from yoga, showered, and I FaceTime my mom while I eat: roasted pork chop, broccoli stalks, sweet potatoes, and strawberries as a snack. 8:15 p.m. \u2014 I talk to my boyfriend while I eat a peanut butter granola bar from Trader Joe's. I get really snacky in the evenings and I'm trying to break the habit. I rationalize it by telling myself I worked it off in yoga. 9 p.m. \u2014 I need to study, but instead I watch  Ali Wong: Baby Cobra  while drinking peppermint tea. I'll make up for studying tomorrow. The special has some really funny and really cringeworthy parts. I pass out in bed by 10.

It started as a PRN gig, but both parties enjoyed it so much that I've stayed there permanently. There is always a pot of coffee brewed, and I drink some while I catch up with the front desk staff on hospital gossip. 10:15 a.m. \u2014 I'm starving and eat some blueberries, blackberries, and strawberries during a gap between patients. 11:30 a.m. \u2014 We've finished seeing patients and I see that John Mulaney is coming to the theater RIGHT near my apartment building. My roommate and I love him so I buy the two of us and her friend tickets as she's busy in Nashville. We can't believe our luck. She immediately Venmos me for their share.  $33 12 p.m. \u2014 I eat lunch (pork chop, broccoli stalk, mushrooms, and sweet potatoes), but I'm still hungry after. I find cinnamon BelVita cookies in my backpack. I have  everything  in my backpack, I swear. 5:15 p.m. \u2014 Done seeing patients and I head straight to CVS. I got my hair done in February for my birthday, and while the stylist did an amazing job, I'm sick of the blonde. I'm a brunette at heart! I buy a box of light brown Revlon dye on sale.  $8.52 6:30 p.m. \u2014 My hair looks good! It's a little ashy but since the dye is cheap it should fade a bit within a week.

I'm especially tired for some reason today. 8:30 a.m. \u2014 I leave the OR and head over to my side of the hospital for clinic. We're slammed with patients \u2014 thank the medical gods that my coffee is finally kicking in. 11:58 a.m. \u2014 We somehow finish with our patients on time! I think if I eat another pre-packed pork chop meal, I'm going to kill someone, so I grab Tijuana Flats with my coworkers. I get a blackened chicken burrito bowl and it is  so  good.  $8.53 4:45 p.m. \u2014 Finish with our afternoon patients early, too! Sometimes, I really underestimate my doctor; he was on a roll today. I change out of my scrubs at the office and drive over to barre for a class. 6:30 p.m. \u2014 My barre instructor went rogue today and now I can't feel my legs. 7:15 p.m. \u2014 I think the burrito bowl was the cure for my brief pork chop strike, because I happily eat my usual meal this week when I get home while I FaceTime my mom. After I eat, I end up studying for a bit. Advertisement 8:50 p.m. \u2014 The snack attack strikes again.

I only drink about half my coffee before the patients start rolling in. 8:30 a.m. \u2014 We don't see patients on Fridays in clinic, so our schedule is massively laid back. I tell my front desk secretary I'll be late and pick up everyone a coffee and a donut from Dunkin'. I have coupons with me and get four coffees and four donuts.  $5.11 8:42 a.m. \u2014 I'm back at my desk and working on getting authorizations for patient procedures. I drink my caramel iced coffee and eat my donut \u2014 old fashioned is the best. 12 p.m. \u2014 I clock out of work and go back to my apartment to deep clean and pack for my weekend trip to Gainesville. Usually, I leave at 5 but my boyfriend and I have an obligation this evening. 12:45 p.m. \u2014 Packed in my car ready to go and realize that I need gas. I get gas maybe once a month because the furthest I drive is to go to barre class. I don't even know if I'm getting a particularly good deal at this station or not. I get nine gallons.  $18.19 Advertisement 3 p.m. \u2014 Finally with my man! We are staying at his parents' house, and we chill for a bit before his mom comes home. She arrives with strawberry popsicles. 7 p.m. \u2014 I have been waiting for this event FOREVER. My boyfriends mom is a barre instructor and they're doing a \u201cBring-A-Boy\u201d class tonight. She's an insanely hard teacher, but watching my boyfriend and his dad flounder through the class is worth every ounce of pain. After, we eat soft pretzels and beer that the studio provides. 8 p.m. \u2014 His parents take us to dinner at a local Mexican restaurant. I get fish tacos and we split a margarita pitcher between the table. They graciously pay. 9:30 p.m. \u2014 The combo of the margarita and my early wakeup time has me down for the count.

We stay at the coffee shop a little longer so she can meet us there and we can catch up. She starts medical school on Monday! 2:30 p.m. \u2014 I want to go thrifting to see if there are any cute, cheap outfits I can get before my trip. After about 30 minutes of searching, I'm overwhelmed and give up. (I'm a very impatient shopper.) My boyfriend gets a pair of pants and I leave empty-handed. 5:30 p.m. \u2014 My boyfriend's father's birthday is this week, and we go out to dinner to celebrate with their friends. We tear into a seafood boil; it's more than I've eaten in a while. Again, his lovely parents treat us. 8:30 p.m. \u2014 We're absolutely stuffed from dinner but are still craving DQ blizzards.

I sweat my butt off spectating while my boyfriend does actual exercise. They get their asses kicked. Advertisement 10 a.m. \u2014 We decide to get post-game a\u00e7ai bowls for breakfast. As we pull in the parking lot, I realize I don't have my wallet with me, so my boyfriend and I split a bowl that he covers. 10:30 a.m. \u2014 The a\u00e7ai bowl place is next to the coffee shop from yesterday, and I'm craving another honey and cinnamon coffee. I think my boyfriend notices my longing glances and offers to get me one. I accept. 11:45 a.m. \u2014 We go to a local hip grocery store to get poke bowls. While we wait for them to be made, I wander around and grab produce I'll need for the week. I end up getting broccoli, four packs of blueberries, asparagus, green beans, and peanut butter. I also cover both of our poke bowls and coffee from earlier.  $34.25 1 p.m. \u2014 We finish eating lunch and sadly, I have to leave. My boyfriend will also be in Tennessee next week on a completely different trip, and we know we will see each other in Nashville at least one night. 4 p.m. \u2014 After a dramatic and awful drive home, I'm back in St. Pete. I FaceTime my mom and lay in bed to rest up before my game. I joined a co-ed softball league that plays in a park in the city. I played for 14 years, and it's great to have the game back in my life. 6 p.m. \u2014 I'm extremely lazy and drive instead of walk to the park for my softball game. I get nailed in the leg with a line drive, which quickly turns into a gnarly bruise. We lose, but I have a great time.

It's time to seize the day.

I thank him for offering and ask him to get me an everything bagel toasted with cream cheese, and he obliges. What a sweet human. 8:30 a.m. \u2014 I arrive at the office and my coworker hands me my bagel. I thank him and ask for his Venmo account to pay him, but he says not to worry about it. I brought our team scones a few weeks ago and he says this time, breakfast is on him. It's already a fantastic start to the weekend. 10 a.m. \u2014 I'm stuck in a long meeting, but JP Cooper tickets are on sale for AmEx card owners! My coworker offers to help me buy them with his AmEx card. He snags my friend and me two tickets during my meeting. I thank him and pay him back on Venmo. I am so pumped to see JP Cooper live. How can one artist possess so much talent?  $41 1 p.m. \u2014 Today is my coworker's birthday. We decide to go out for a sit-down lunch and head to Barn Joo, a nice Korean restaurant, to celebrate. I order the beef japchae. The sweet potato noodles are slightly overcooked but still delicious. All of my coworkers box up their leftovers to go since the portion sizes are huge. I, on the other hand, proudly finish the entire entr\u00e9e and head back to the office feeling mildly lethargic. Pero like, what is portion control? I regret nothing.  $22.12 Advertisement 6 p.m. \u2014 I made plans to attend a yoga class in East Village with a friend. It starts at 7 so we explore St Marks Place for a bit before heading over. The studio is donation-based and focuses on providing yoga for everyone. My practice today is tough but fulfilling. I went to a kickboxing class the day before and still feel sore. However, I flow through the practice with more ease than usual and notice that I am getting stronger. There's no better feeling. My friend and I each donate $5 as we head out.  $5 8:30 p.m. \u2014 I bid my friend goodbye and hop on the train back to the Upper East Side. I am going out with work friends tonight and have to shower, get ready, and hop back on the train down to the East Village. My friend is throwing a pregame at her apartment. I love living on the Upper East Side, but it is definitely a bit out of the way. I am planning to move further downtown next year. 10:15 p.m. \u2014 I arrive at my friend's bomb-ass studio in Gramercy. We organized a GNO (girls night out) with a group of gal pals from work, and it's really nice to hang out outside of work. All of the girls are down to earth and fun. We gossip about work, boys, and throw back tequila shots. Cheers to the freaking weekend! 12:30 a.m. \u2014 We finally head out. I call us a Lyft to the Lower East Side and Venmo request them later. Since moving to NYC, I've made the switch from Uber to Lyft. I've learned that Lyft has better corporate policies and takes a smaller cut from their drivers, and it is the exact same service. We head to Hair of the Dog, a college-type dance bar.  $17.70 Advertisement 1:25 a.m. \u2014 The bar is packed and we can barely walk. My friends buy tequila shots but I abstain and we promptly dip out. We head over to Pianos, a nearby bar with dancing, and chill for five minutes before deciding the music is abysmal and not worth paying the $8 cover for the upper-level dance floor. Once again, we dip out and walk to Los Feliz, my personal favorite. It's a multi-level Latin and hip-hop bar and we spend the rest of the night there dancing. I pay for a round of tequila shots for my friends, and Venmo request them later. I'm still appalled at how absurdly expensive drinks are in NYC. $46 with tip for four tequila shots? Horrifying.  $46 2:30 a.m. \u2014 Tonight, I am the ultimate wing woman and successfully set up two of my friends with cuties. I am also single but scared of human boys, so I groove with my friends all night and curve all the boys. After getting sick of dodging guys, I escape to the back of the bar where I spot a boy dancing by himself like a straight boss. I join him on the ledge and we perform an impromptu hip-hop routine. That's the reason I go out! 3:30 a.m. \u2014 We are tired and very hungry! Rumor has it there's a 24-hour Ukrainian pierogi joint in East Village. I never thought I'd need pierogis at 4 a.m. but tonight is the night. I order eight pierogis in assorted flavors and chow down. Our waiter is Ukrainian and hot. After picking up our bill, I write down my phone number on the receipt. Why not? He does not end up texting me, but at least the pierogis were scrumptious!  $13 Advertisement 4:30 a.m. \u2014 I call a Lyft Line home. A young couple joins me and somehow takes up almost all of the backseat. As a result, I am squished up against the window and deeply uncomfortable.

I can NEVER sleep well after a night out. I swear, my body is programmed to wake me up around 9 or 10 a.m. without fail. (I wish it was programmed to make me exercise as regularly.) I lounge around in bed, eventually turning on my UE Boom to listen to the sweet sounds of JP Cooper. 11:30 a.m. \u2014 I feel slightly guilty after spending so much money yesterday and commit the rare act of preparing breakfast for myself. I cut up a ripe papaya, wash a carton of blackberries, and make myself an egg, sunny side up. I devour the ensemble while chatting with my roommate about her boy woes. She recently began sleeping with a boy from work and the relationship is in a gray area all too familiar to my generation. I listen, sympathize, and provide my input. My personal love life can be described as crickets chirping, a gym on Christmas morning, my bank account after rent is due... You get the idea. 12:30 p.m. \u2014 My roommate heads out for the day and I crawl back into bed and listen to music. After a bit, I get myself together and walk to my favorite coffee shop. I call my dad on the walk over. He called me yesterday because he missed me but I was busy. My dad is my best friend and we are the biggest dorks together. (He is also a Renaissance man who writes, composes, and produces his own music. He's won awards overseas for his songs.) On the phone, he asks me to sing a song he wrote in Mandarin. He's wanted me to do this for the longest time, but singing in Mandarin is intimidating and my dad's style of music is\u2026very different than mine. I know it will make him happy, and that makes me happy, so I agree. He emails me the lyrics and music. I promise to take a stab at it.

I bring my journal and my new copy of  The Sun and Her Flowers  by Rupi Kaur. It's a book of beautiful prose and poetry with themes of love, heartbreak, abuse, and healing. Before reading, I spend an hour journaling about the past week. Journaling has been my form of therapy ever since high school. I spill my deepest thoughts onto these pages; it's my safe space. After journaling, I pull open  The Sun and Her Flowers  and read a few chapters. Kaur's prose is simple but powerful. I highly recommend.  $4 3:30 p.m. \u2014 I leave Caf\u00e9 Jax and make my way home. On the way back, I stop by Xi'an Famous Foods and grab an order of their spinach dumplings to go. Believe me, this the best item on their menu. My family is from Xi'an; so much of the menu is essentially the \u201cfast food\u201d version of some of my favorite homestyle cooking. It's both a blessing and a curse that there's a location right near my house. The food comes fast and I skip home, excited to eat.  $9.70 5:30 p.m. \u2014 After eating, I take a two hour \u201cnap\u201d and wake up disgruntled. I had tentative plans to head to a coworker's birthday drinks but decide against it. Instead, I text my brother to hang out, and his girlfriend asks if I want to go out. Still recovering from the night before I politely decline. My brother invites me to come over and be bums with him. He gets me. I take the train to his house and we watch  Elf  and  Blades of Glory  together. I eat his snacks. That's what big brothers are for right? Advertisement 1:15 a.m. \u2014 I take a Lyft line home.

I am a restless soul, so much so that I regret lounging around at home during the weekends. I have the constant urge to go outside and explore. I shower, get changed, and listen to JP Cooper on Spotify while I get ready to go. 10:30 a.m. \u2014 I arrive at Padoca Bakery, an adorable coffee shop a few blocks from my apartment. I order an espresso (a responsible move toward becoming fully functional this morning), and a pumpkin cranberry muffin. I settle in a cozy nook and devour it all. Unfortunately, the space in the shop is tight and a stranger accidentally knocks over my espresso, spilling it all over my lap and my coat. He apologizes and buys me another one. I am mildly distressed but do not blame him. It's clearly an early morning for all of us.  $5.99 12:15 p.m. \u2014 My friend is meeting me on the Upper East Side for brunch. We haven't hung out in forever and I'm happy she was able to make the trek up to my neighborhood. We usually meet at her apartment in Midtown so I'm excited to show her around. We walk to a Vietnamese restaurant I've been meaning to check out and share spring rolls, a huge bowl of pho, and stir-fried rice noodles. The food is absolutely delicious. I backpacked across Vietnam this past summer, and the food is just as tasty as I remembered. We sit and catch up and she shows me her matches on Coffee Meets Bagel. I am not on any dating apps, so I swipe through her \"daily bagels\" and message a few potential suitors. We giggle like little girls. I pick up the bill and she Venmos me.  $49.37 Advertisement 3:45 p.m. \u2014 We are still stuffed after brunch but succumb to a lingering sweet tooth. We stop inside 16 Handles, our favorite fro-yo joint, and each grabs a generous helping. I mix cookies and cream with mint chocolate chip and top it off with all sorts of chocolatey goodies. We sit inside and enjoy.  $4.80 4:20 p.m. \u2014 This gloomy weather is perfect for an afternoon at the museum. Despite having a corporate badge that allows me and guests free entry, I have yet to enter the Met. I've managed many breakfasts atop the Met steps but always get too lazy to go inside. We walk over and I get my friend and myself in for free. I visit my favorite painting in the European painting gallery, \u201cThe Young Bather\u201d by Gustave Courbet. I love gazing at it every time I visit the Met. It's an oil-on-canvas portrait of a nude woman with beautiful curves. I'm not huge into art, but the woman looks so comfortable in her own skin and at peace with the world. In the description, one writer praises the \u201cbeautiful girl\u201d as \u201chealth itself, with an ample and plump silhouette\u2026one couldn't be more independent or more true.\u201d 5:15 p.m. \u2014 The Met closes at 5:30 so we quickly visit the new Michelangelo exhibit (which is a bit too crowded for our liking), and head home. It's dark outside and a regular Met street performer is playing the saxophone beautifully. I smile at him and he gives me a thumbs up. I shoot him one right back. The entire neighborhood looks so elegant at night. Happy and relaxed, I walk my friend to the subway station and hug her goodbye. I walk home. Advertisement 6 p.m. \u2014 I have brunch leftovers for dinner and slice up a persimmon for dessert. They are one of my favorite fruits and the local fruit stands make them highly accessible. My roommate has her boy over so I watch Netflix in my room, making no noise, and pretending that I don't exist. (Shout out if you get the reference!) 7 p.m. \u2014 I remember that my coworkers and I are doing a Secret Santa soon. The max limit is $10, so I browse Amazon and purchase a pack of 10 Korean sheet masks and buy an extra pack for myself. These are so luxurious and a winter skincare essential. Plus, they sell for like $6 apiece at Sephora \u2014 so it's a great beauty hack.  $19.28 8:30 p.m. \u2014 I despise going to the gym and am almost finished with a Groupon deal for kickboxing classes that I purchased a few months ago. I bookmarked a Groupon deal for three weeks of unlimited yoga at a studio close to my apartment. I have missed practicing yoga regularly, so I decide to purchase it.

I set it for later than usual to let myself sleep an extra 20 minutes. I had a terrible sleep last night. My roommate had her boy over and I had a hard time falling asleep. I'm all for guiding the D, but my roommate has had him over on Sunday evenings and random weekdays; it's not an ideal situation. I may talk to her about it if it gets too uncomfortable.

I hop on the subway to work. 8:55 a.m. \u2014 I arrive at work and greet a few of my coworkers. I pull out my cereal, pour it into a bowl, and head into the kitchen to grab some soy milk. Our office has awesome perks. Free milk, coffee, cold brew on tap, cold pressed juices, and an espresso machine. No complaints. I prepare a bowl of cereal and eat at my desk. 9:10 a.m. \u2014 Our office Slack channel posts about free coffee beverages downstairs. My coworkers and I head down and grab a few cans of fancy coffee. I grab a can of Pumpkin Spice latte and a can Peppermint mocha for my coworker who hasn't arrived at work yet. Each can is delicious and has two and a half cups of coffee's worth of caffeine! Yup, it's that type of morning. 11:45 a.m. \u2014 After my second meeting of the day I'm pretty hungry. Nanoosh recently came to our office for an event and handed our team a bunch of $5 off coupons. I snag one from my team's stash and head to the caf\u00e9 with a coworker. I order a large butternut squash soup with extra pita. With the coupon, it comes to $1.80. (Sure wish I had an unlimited supply of these coupons.) My coworker gets the same thing and we walk over to Washington Square Park to eat by the fountain. This is our favorite lunch spot because both the people- and puppy-watching are fantastic. The soup is delicious and hits the spot in this chilly weather.  $1.80 Advertisement 12:30 p.m. \u2014 My coworker and I are still hungry after the soup (go figure) and decide to head to the Italian market nearby in search of protein. We split a meat and cheese platter and head back to the office to pair it with sourdough bread we have stashed in our drawers. Our company gets a discount at the market so the platter comes down to a little under $4. I hand her $2 cash at the office.  $2 5 p.m. \u2014 I'm done with meetings for the day and have made good progress on a webpage I've been working on. I'm a firm believer in leaving once you're done with work. My office has pretty great hours. Everyone typically leaves around 5 to 5:30 p.m. 5:40 p.m. \u2014 The Q train is moving like a snail today so it takes me nearly 40 minutes to get home. I trudge up the stairs of my fifth-floor walkup. I swear the stairs have barely gotten any easier after four months into my lease. I'll just think of it as a free booty workout! I take a quick shower and chat with my roommate about the upcoming holiday \u201cbanger\u201d we are planning. This is our first time entertaining in NYC so we're both pumped. We agree that popcorn and mistletoe are necessities, and we discuss buying the fluffy pillows we've been eyeing on Target.com. They are $13 each. I order two and pay online with my Redcard for an additional 5% off. She Venmos me half.  $27 Advertisement 6:30 p.m. \u2014 I recently decided Sundays are for resting so Mondays are my new errand-running, get-my-life-together day. That makes today laundry day, a.k.a. the worst day of the month. My laundromat is across the street from my apartment, so laundry day requires me to go up and down our walkup about three or four times. I begrudgingly drag myself across the street with a horrifyingly large bag of laundry. My roommate jokes that I look like Santa with a bunch of presents on my back. I joke back there are no presents here. I arrive and find out that the laundromat has raised the price of washing and drying by a dollar. Blasphemy! As a result of laziness, I mean my thrifty nature, I mix all my clothes together to finish it in one load. My mom is probably quaking in her boots back home.  $5.50 6:40 p.m. \u2014 I make my way up five flights of stairs back into my apartment and prepare dinner. I typically eat out for lunch during the week and cook dinner at home. I slice up a ripe avocado and toast Ezekial bread from Trader Joe's. I top off the avocado toast with chia seeds and sriracha. This is my secret combo that I've been eating regularly, without fail, since college. My college roommates used to poke fun at me because I never got sick of the ensemble for three years. Give it try! I've converted all of my friends. I fry an egg sunny side up and pour a glass of seltzer water. I've developed the worst habit of drinking only seltzer water at home. After I run out, I'm going to try curbing the habit. I eat my meal while rewatching  Parks and Rec  for the umpteenth time. Andy and April are couple goals. Advertisement 8:30 p.m. \u2014 I finish folding my laundry and treat myself to some dark chocolate. My favorite is the Dark Chocolate Lover's Bar from Trader Joe's. I lay in bed and watch Kehlani's \u201cDistraction\u201d music video. This song is giving me life; mad early '90s, early 2000s vibes. Not to mention she is so sexy! 10 p.m. \u2014 I feel a bit blue and decide to go outside for a walk. There's a puppy daycare near my house and I stand outside and look at the two lone pups left there for the night. (FTR, I refer to all dogs as pups.) I shed a few tears by myself and walk home. Nothing like a good, dramatic cry alone in the cold! In all realness, crying is healthy. I go to sleep immediately after I get home.

After that, I grab a few slices of sourdough bread from my drawer and pair it with organic peanut butter. 12 p.m. \u2014 I have a lunch date with a few gal pals from work and we head to Vapiano for pasta. It's my first time and I order the pasta picante, which is delicious. I finish every bite.  $13.65 3:30 p.m. \u2014 I'm supposed to attend a kickboxing class after work today but I feel so meh I call and reschedule. I blame da pasta. 6 p.m. \u2014 The hormonal cravings are on. I suddenly feel a deep longing for junk food. I head to the 7-Eleven right outside my apartment and get a Take 5 bar (the most underrated candy bar) and a bag of snack mix. Instagram-worthy.  $4.67 Advertisement 8 p.m. \u2014 I devour my snacks and spend the rest of the night watching Netflix and YouTube videos. I'm binge-watching the second season of  Stranger Things  and it is fire. Eleven is my spirit animal. Steve Harrington is such a babe. After vegging out for a few hours I hit the lights.

I opt for a mug of hot coffee from the office kitchen and add a dash of soy milk. Breakfast is served. 12 p.m. \u2014 Sweetgreen is hosting a promo event at my office so my coworkers and I each get a free salad! I get the harvest bowl, which is full of greens, sweet potato, chicken, grains, and goat cheese. It's normally $15. I devour it and it is indeed delicious. However, I would probably never pay full price for it unless it morphed into a burger. 4 p.m. \u2014 My office is hosting another event with free catering! My coworkers and I load up on hors d'oeuvres: fresh fruit, cheese and crackers, meat skewers, potstickers, and sushi! For dessert, we grab company-branded cupcakes. All the free food this week reminds me of my college days! 7 p.m. \u2014 My hormones are all out of whack this week. I don't know why I've been so affected by PMS the past few months. After coming home, I pop on some Netflix and take a \"nap.\" 9 p.m. \u2014 I wake up unaware of what country I'm in, but quickly come back to my senses and acknowledge that I am once again craving chocolate. I haul ass down five flights of stairs to 7-Eleven and get another Take 5 bar, a Snickers bar, and a pack of snack mix. I will literally never get sick of this combo. Treat yo'self always, but ESPECIALLY during your period! I walk home to eat my goodies while watching  Stranger Things .  $7.67 Advertisement Daily Total: $7.67", "day_seven": "Day Seven: 8:30 a.m. \u2014 You'd think I learned my lesson on excessive late-night snacking but no. I arrive at work, full again from pregaming breakfast last night. I opt for another mug of hot coffee with a dash of soy milk. Nom nom nom. 12 p.m. \u2014 My coworkers and I decide to check out the holiday market at Union Square for lunch today. I grab a lunch set from a food vendor selling bao, and get two buns and spring rolls. The food is okay but extremely salty.  $11 5:15 p.m. \u2014 What a feat; I finally make it to my kickboxing studio. I love showing up every one two or three weeks smiling at the instructors like I never left. One of the kickboxing instructors at the studio is such a cutie. His energy, upbeat personality, and corny jokes motivate me to try harder in class. He smiles and says hi to me and pays extra close attention to me during the class. I keep joking with my friends that I'm going to ask him out before my last kickboxing class. (I only have three classes left!) We shall see if I've still got game. 7 p.m. \u2014 For dinner, I make my usual avocado toast, and for dessert, I finish a leftover candy bar from the night before.

I showered the night before and quickly put my clothes on today. I live about an hour and 20 minutes from the airport and my goal is to leave the house by 5:15 a.m. I grab my things and hit the road. Twenty minutes into my drive, I see Dunkin' Donuts. My routine on flight days is to always get a large coffee with almond milk and a turkey sausage and egg wrap. I typically skip breakfast, but travel days are long and this may be the only thing I get the chance to eat for a while.  $5.25 8:30 a.m. \u2014 We finally receive confirmation from the aviation crew that the plane is departing. It was a tougher-than-expected crowd this morning and we had some hiccups with luggage. My boss and I manage a private travel program that flies clients from destinations around North America, and we deal with a very wealthy clientele. Every day is different. We don't have time to dwell, however, because we have another flight leaving from a different airport in two hours. Before getting in my car, I buy a huge bottle of water from the vending machine. I left my bottle at home.  $2.30 Advertisement 2 p.m. \u2014 The second flight is delayed due to weather, and everyone is in a particularly sour mood. Once the plane is off the ground, my boss and I pack up our things and decide that a post-work cocktail is needed. We drive around for a while until we find the perfect dive bar that reminds us both of college. We each order a beer and proceed to chat for the next half hour. Upon finishing the first drink, we announce that second one is in order and we spend another 45 minutes talking about work, life, and everything else. We make friends with the bartender, who must have given us a deal. The bill is $12, and we split it equally with both of us leaving a $3 tip.  $9 5 p.m. \u2014 After dropping my boss off at the train station, I start my long drive home. I stop at a gas station along the way and fill up my car. When I drive to the airport, I can expense the trip, and I get $0.55 per mile. This adds up, especially when we have multiple flight days each month, and I typically put my expense checks into savings. I bought a car new six months ago, and I've already put 10,000 miles on it. ($33.42 expensed) 6:45 p.m. \u2014 I get home and immediately let my dog out. On busy work days, I ask one of my seasonal hires (who is 20 and in college) to let my dog out throughout the day. He typically comes to work and everywhere else with me, but we've been crazy busy lately, and it's just not feasible for me to bring him along. I always leave $20 when I ask her to do this, which helps when I ask her for last-minute favors.  $20 Advertisement Daily Total: $36.55", "day_two": "Day Two: 8 a.m. \u2014 I wake up to my alarm and lounge in bed for about 45 minutes until I decide it's time to get up. I let my dog out and proceed to hop in the shower. My job offers me a ton of flexibility, and when we are not busy, I can choose my hours. Since I'm a night owl, I prefer to go into work around 10 a.m., but I have no issue working until 8 or 9 at night. I finish getting ready, grab my dog, and get in my car to go to the office. Along the way, I stop at the local coffee shop and order a drip coffee with almond milk.  $2.60 12:30 p.m. \u2014 I'm an awful cook, and since I travel so much, I typically don't buy a ton of groceries. I've tried meal planning, but my schedule is all over the place and I eat out more often than not. Around 12, I call in an order to a local caf\u00e9. I get a chicken Caesar salad to go, and get in my car to pick it up. While waiting in line, I buy a kombucha as well. It's all ridiculously overpriced. but I'd rather eat something I enjoy versus trying to make something that doesn't taste great.  $15.60 6 p.m. \u2014 It's time to leave work and I remember that I need to get dog food. I stop by the local ranch supply store to buy a  very  overpriced bag of grain-free lamb and rice dog food. I'm single and tend to spoil my dog more than is needed. While standing in line, I also get him a bag of dog treats for the fun of it.  $44.99 Advertisement 7:30 p.m. \u2014 I'm not quite hungry for dinner, but I know I will get cravings at 10 p.m. if I don't eat something now.

We're only working out of one private airport today, so I bring my dog because he's allowed in our office. We leave the house later than normal at 5:30 a.m., and I can tell that I didn't eat enough yesterday because I can feel a headache coming on. By the time I hit the Dunkin' Donuts, I'm already thinking about food that I normally would never eat. I order my typical coffee with almond milk plus the turkey sausage wrap, but I order a side of hashbrowns as well. I immediately regret it because the potatoes are disgusting and weren't worth the extra $1.50.  $7.40 11 a.m. \u2014 The plane takes off without any issues, which is a great relief. I'm still tired from the morning drive and have had three cups of free coffee from the airport caf\u00e9. The breakfast I ate earlier did nothing for my headache, so my boss and I order something from Seamless. We choose a local deli, and we both get a cobb salad with extra avocado. It takes nearly two hours for the order to arrive, and once we get it, we are both disappointed. I've never been a big fan of delivery services outside of NYC, and this experience reminds me why.  $27 Advertisement 1 p.m. \u2014 After our sad lunch, my boss and I leave for the day. We both think a Bloody Mary would be good before we go on our separate ways, and we find a local tavern close to the train station. We sip on those for about 30 minutes while chatting about our personal lives and our plans for after the holidays. My boss offers to buy this round, and I say that I'm long overdue to get the next one. Once we finish, I drop her off at the train station and make my way home. 5 p.m. \u2014 Before I get home, I stop at the local market in my little town for a few essentials. I love shopping locally but the prices are definitely stiffer than normal grocery stores. I get two avocados, a bag of quinoa, cherry tomatoes, brie, crackers, mini corn tortillas, turkey burger, black bean hummus, and a bottle of my favorite sauvignon blanc. The price seems ridiculous for the amount of items I purchased, and I remind myself to eat all of this before ordering out. Back at home, I open the wine and proceed to cook the turkey burger and make tacos with the hummus, tortillas, and avocados. It's not the worst thing I've ever made, and I definitely have leftovers for lunch tomorrow. I'm quite proud of myself!  $57.60 7 p.m. \u2014 I clean up after dinner and continue making my way through the bottle of wine. I've been mulling over what to get my boss for Christmas, and I think a spa gift card would be the best, given how stressful her job can be sometimes. I online to find a nice spa near where my boss lives and go down a rabbit hole of a thousand options. I'm not from the East Coast and still feel intimidated trying to figure out where things are in New York City and how far places are from one another. I settle on a spa that I think will work, and they have a discount on gift cards where you get $20 off a $200 purchase. I go for it and check one holiday gift off my list.  $180 Advertisement Daily Total: $272", "day_four": "Day Four: 9 a.m. \u2014 The bottle of wine from the night before got to me and I wake up late. I was already going to take the day off, given how many things I had to do. I get out of bed and take my dog for a walk before showering. We take a 45-minute trip around our little town and chat with a few neighbors along the way. I get back to my house and proceed to take a long, hot shower that changes everything. I blow dry my hair and then start making a to-do list of everything I need to accomplish. I start my first load of laundry and realize that I'm out of detergent. I run to the local store and grab Tide Pods and a kombucha, before speeding back to my house.  $12.85 12 p.m. \u2014 I spend most of the morning doing laundry and other household cleaning tasks, and eat the leftover tacos for lunch while writing work emails. I need a midday caffeine pick me up and drive to the local caf\u00e9 for my drip coffee with almond milk. I'm traveling tomorrow, so I spend the rest of my afternoon packing and cleaning.  $3.40 6 p.m. \u2014 I promised one of my friends we'd have dinner this evening and she reminds me at 3 p.m. We pick a nicer local restaurant we both love, figuring that an early dinner would suit us well. I order the chicken parmesan and a glass of white and she orders the fish of the day special with a glass of red. We chat about her recent breakup, which has been a rough one, and each get another glass of wine. Two and half hours later, we move to another location and I offer to buy dinner as part of her Christmas present. We proceed to have another drink at a local wine bar, and I realize that I need to chill for a little bit before driving. We stay for another hour or so, and I drink water while my friend has another glass of wine. We split this bill, and I give her a ride home.  $62 Advertisement Daily Total: $78.25", "day_five": "Day Five: 7 a.m. \u2014 It's another flight day, but at least this one doesn't start as early. The plane is landing at 11, so I don't need to be there until 10:30 a.m. I get up early to finish packing. My dog sitter has confirmed that she can stay at my house for the next few days, so I write her a thank you note and leave her a few details about my house. I also leave $150 (expensed) for her help. 9 a.m. \u2014 I give my dog a hug and get on the road. My car is at the quarter mark so I might as well fill up now instead of waiting until I land in a few days. My dad always taught me to never let my gas gauge get below half a tank during the winter, and it's something that stuck with me. I stop at the gas station to fill up, and grab a sugar-free Red Bull for the hell of it.

My good friend and I used to work at my company's property in the Caribbean together, and she's flying down with me for a work reunion. We're having lunch on the plane but I'm starving and get a protein bar from the vending machine at the airport. This holds me over until we're able to take off.  $1.60 Advertisement 2:30 p.m. \u2014 We land but we have to wait an hour for the next boat to take us to our final destination. We go to a local bar and each order a rum punch. The prices here are ridiculous, but they don't scrimp on the rum, so we're happy. We tip the bartender $3 each.  $15 5 p.m. \u2014 We arrive and are greeted by old friends; I knew this was going to be a fun trip.

We head to our preferred local sand bar around 10 a.m. and find our favorite bartender working. We have a great time catching up, and he keeps the drinks flowing. We leave around 1 p.m. and when we ask for the bill, our bartender shrugs us off. We each leave $20 cash as a tip, and promise to come back later with everyone else.  $20 2 p.m. \u2014 We call one of our friends to pick us up so we can go rent our golf cart. Because of inflation, the cost per day to rent an electric golf cart is $60 plus tax, which comes out to almost $65 exactly. We're going to have this cart for the next three days, so we split it evenly.  $97.50 Advertisement 4 p.m. \u2014 We get our golf cart and then take a nap to reserve our energy. After waking up, our old roommate shows up to the house with fishing rods and tells us to go to the market for bait. We get in our cart, drive to the store, and get a box of squid for $10. On the way back, we stop by the liquor store to get a few bottles of wine. Again, prices are far higher here, so we ended up getting two bottles of rose for $29 each.  $34.61 8 p.m. \u2014 We end up fishing into the dark, which is something my friend and I both love doing. Nothing is better than watching the sun set over the ocean. We end up having a beach bonfire with most of our good friends, and by 8, everyone is in a good mood. We pack up around 8:30 and tell everyone to meet us at the sand bar for dinner. We order enough food for a crowd: three pizzas, three dozen wings, two quesadillas, two orders of fish fingers, and three baskets of fries. C 'est la vie , I suppose. Someone in the group pays for all the food without us noticing, but my friend and I grab the bartender so at least we can pay for our drinks.

When I get out of the shower, I feel 10 times better. My friend wakes up and we get breakfast ingredients from the local store. We buy eggs, ham, grits, and coffee, which turn into the ultimate breakfast of champions. We split the bill and I sit in the kitchen on my computer for a few hours while my friend makes breakfast. I chug a few glasses of water before grabbing coffee, and after breakfast I'm feeling almost back to normal.

I bring leftover lentil soup with me but I'm not hungry and save it for later. 3:30 p.m. \u2014 I get home and try to apply myself to my readings for the next couple of hours. 5:30 p.m. \u2014 I'm suddenly starving, so I make brown rice to have with my leftover lentil soup. I love cooking and in the colder months, I try to make a big batch of soup once a week; that's an easy go-to when I'm too tired or busy to cook. Lentil is my favorite soup because it's pretty high in protein and I can throw in whatever vegetables we happen to have in the fridge. 8:30 p.m. \u2014 My boyfriend gets home and we head out on our weekly grocery rounds. We are both pretty picky about our groceries, so we go to both Trader Joe's and Whole Foods every week. At Trader Joe's, we stock up on apples, onions, garlic, ginger, peanut butter, crackers, pomegranate, RXBars, brown rice, pinto beans, potatoes, and butter. At Whole Foods, we buy eggs, kefir, coffee, roasted nuts in bulk, salad greens, kale, broccoli, goat cheese, and a frozen pizza. I've been a vegetarian for almost 14 years, but my boyfriend eats meat so we also grab veggie breakfast sausage, regular breakfast sausage, and ground beef. We split the groceries 50-50, and both end up spending $25 at each location. Before we leave Whole Foods, we both decide we are hungry. I buy us each a slice of pizza.  $57.50 Advertisement Daily Total: $60.50", "day_three": "Day Three: 8:30 a.m. \u2014 I have a fried egg, toast, and veggie bacon for breakfast and my boyfriend makes me a coffee.

I really hate buying food on campus because there aren't any good healthy options and it's all overpriced. I eat an RXBar and an apple that I brought from home. 5 p.m. \u2014 Exhausted, I make it home and veg out, watching an episode of  Silicon Valley  before I start on dinner. I'm craving carbs so I make myself pasta and a huge green salad with goat cheese, broccoli, kale, tomatoes, and a homemade vinaigrette. 5:40 p.m. \u2014 My nannying schedule shifted this week so the parents can have a date night. I head over to their place, imagining a productive night of reading and writing. 8:45 p.m. \u2014 The baby is in a terrible mood because of her cold and needs tons of extra attention; my productive night quickly evaporates. She finally falls asleep after much back-rubbing, feeding, cradling, etc. I go downstairs to try to get work done but I can't find the monitor, and as a paranoid nanny, I feel the need to check on her every 30 minutes or so. I try to work but mostly I read random articles online until her parents get home. 11:20 p.m. \u2014 They are late but I don't really mind. Luckily, they round up and give me an extra hour's worth.

I'm really on edge and I decide to do a workout to cut some of my stress. I use physical activity primarily for therapeutic purposes, but lately, I've been focusing on strength training after my boyfriend turned me on to kettlebell workouts. There are so many amazing kettlebell workout classes on YouTube. My favorites so far are on a channel called BodyFit by Amy. (This is not an ad. I just love this woman's workouts!) I do a 30-minute video and stretch for 10 minutes afterward. 2:30 p.m. \u2014 I think my new strength-training routine has amped up my metabolism because I'm ravenous. I spread goat cheese on toast, fry up an egg, and make two veggie sausages. 4:30 p.m. \u2014 I head to campus for one of my last classes of the semester. 8:45 p.m. \u2014 A few of my classmates decide to meet for beers after class as a celebratory end-of-semester shindig.

I don't have a SEPTA card since I don't take the train that often, so I buy a single-trip ticket. This is my first real doctor's appointment in over five years. I know that sounds insane, but before I started working at my regular salaried job, I was on a form of Medicare that made it so difficult to see a regular practitioner that I avoided going to the doctor at all \u2014 even in cases where I probably really needed to. Now that I buy my insurance from the marketplace, I pay $98 out of pocket each month for my coverage (after the government subsidies). This takes a big hit on my monthly grad student budget, so I finally decided to take advantage of my PPO and make a long overdue well-woman appointment.  $2.50 12:15 p.m. \u2014 I head back home on the train.  $2.50 1:30 p.m. - I decide to squeeze in another workout.

I make a breakfast salad inspired by my favorite breakfast spot in all of Philadelphia, the Hungry Pigeon. It has a hearty helping of breakfast potatoes, veggie sausage, and fried eggs over salad greens with bits of goat cheese mixed in. My boyfriend makes the coffee and fries up a regular sausage for himself. 12 p.m. \u2014 I get a notification that I've sold one of my listings on my Depop shop. I'm pleasantly surprised as it's one of my more expensive listings \u2014 $45.50 after Depop takes a 10% fee. Since I quit my job, I've been using Depop to sell clothes that I don't want or wear anymore. In addition to helping me cleanse my wardrobe, I use these funds to save up for my more frivolous expenses, like makeup or clothing. I am a super conscientious shopper, and when I'm not buying used or vintage, I usually try to buy myself one very nice thing each season from a designer or brand I love. (Here's lookin' at you, Dusen Dusen and Everlane.) The purchase has to hit a lot of criteria for it to be worth my investment: seasonless, unique, and high quality are key.

We drive into Center City to make a few returns and exchanges at Anthropologie and J.Crew. Though I'm tempted, I don't buy anything on my short list of holiday gifts. I am the opposite of an impulse shopper, and I still need to go home to read reviews and compare prices on everything I'm thinking of buying. At this point, I'm eyeing an overcoat for my boyfriend from COS; journals and fun pens for my sisters and my best friend from a local Philly print company called Print Fresh; a big candle or something simple for my boyfriend's parents; a set of special Christmas ornaments for my grandmother; and a pair of festive earrings and a candle for my mom. 2:30 p.m. \u2014 It's snowing really hard and we are both feeling festive and cozy. On our way home, we stop at a new caf\u00e9 in our neighborhood for pastries and a hot chocolate; my boyfriend picks up the tab. 6:30 p.m. \u2014 Neither of us is very hungry, so I throw together salads of greens, roasted beets, goat's cheese, broccoli, and tomato for us with a homemade vinaigrette.

My last gig will be this summer.) 8 a.m. \u2014 Out of the shower and rushing to finish getting ready. I recently got curtain/fringe bangs and they've added 10 minutes to my morning routine, where I normally only take five. I feed the ninja cat and my 10-year-old, 100-pound German shepherd and schedule a dog walker on Wag because I'm running hella late.

I'm going through emails and texting with Eric, one of the guys I'm dating, while also using EveryDollar to track my spending and budget progress. Dating after divorce is weird AF, but I've met some really awesome guys \u2014 and a few not awesome ones. 1 p.m. \u2014 I'm starving in an,  I didn't notice until I finished making calls  way. I'm working on eight open roles and they're all in the final closing stages, so things are hectic. I walk over to Whole Foods to grab a loaf of bread and some kind of snack. I have the taste buds of a five-year-old; I adore PB & Js and love to make those in the office for lunch. I end up with honey wheat bread, a block of cheddar jack cheese, and spoons for the office. I drink a Coke with my lunch, but I brought it from my home stash.  $10.22 4:10 p.m. \u2014 I get a text from a Bumble guy I haven't met yet but have had great banter with for the past two weeks. He wants me to reserve Thursday for a real date for him. I answer with, \"Sure, where are we going?\" and he immediately suggests the restaurant where Dave bartends. Naturally. I quickly redirect him and ask to go somewhere less loud (and with fewer exes). He suggests one of my favorite spots, RM Champagne Salon in the West Loop. On the calendar now!

I let him know, and he tells me to bring my dog over beforehand so she and his dog can have a playdate. Then, I can crash there instead of going back to my neighborhood late at night. Sold. Uber with the dog is $8.55, but I give the driver $5 in cash because of my pup.  $13.55 7 p.m. \u2014 I meet my friend at a new restaurant in River North and we split an entr\u00e9e and a small appetizer.

We've gone round and round trying to make it work, but he pulled a classic move: love bombing in the beginning and cheating later. We backed up and tried to date casually, but even that imploded.

No reply from Dave on the breakup text, which is pretty much his MO. He'll pop up at 2 a.m. sometime in the next week, drunk and horny and wanting me to come over. That ship has sailed, mister. I notice in my checking account that Digit, my savings app, has made a few withdrawals for upcoming goals. I'm saving for a vacation as well as a big credit card payoff and it took out $35.67 and $49.98 for both goals. I love this app because it helps me save without making it too easy for me to pull the money back into my account.  $85.65 10:45 a.m. \u2014 I just received two new roles and some serious validation. A candidate I didn't like (and who I felt was flaky) went around my back and got the job I was hiring for, so we only received 50% of the expected commission after negotiating with the company. They called to apologize because the hire is ruining their relationship with suppliers and they want me to replace this person. Extreme validation, y'all. Calls for a third cup of coffee.

That might sound weird since I'm upset over Dave and I was at Eric's last night, but if my divorce taught me anything, it's don't put all your eggs in one basket. Honestly, until Eric says he's ready, I'm not pushing for anything more than the easygoing time we're having. Plus, being on Bumble keeps me from online shopping. 1 p.m. \u2014 I'm wavering between buying soup from a French bakery and eating my PB & J. My throat hurts, and that seems like a solid enough reason to spring for the soup. The girl at the counter comments on my bangs so this soup was totally worth the self-esteem boost.

I take the Metra and then walk about a mile to my apartment where there's a Jewel-Osco a block over. I probably need to refill my birth control before Christmas break. I also add dry shampoo and adult Lunchables to the list. 6 p.m. \u2014 Kinda forgot my dog was at Eric's. I check in with him to see what his plans are and if my dog ate his apartment. He got home early and my text apparently woke him up from napping with the dogs on the couch. He needs to get a run in, so he volunteers to jog both dogs over to my place. I offer to have food ready so it's a plan. I have two and a half miles to clean and whip something up.

I made chicken sandwiches with avocado, bacon, arugula, and mayo all on Hawaiian bread. I also made a quick batch of sweet potato fries. Eric hangs out for a bit before setting off with his pup to jog home.

There is a mix of dietary needs, so we've got a little bit of a ride to find a vegan and kosher restaurant this afternoon. 3:30 p.m. \u2014 Back in the office from lunch. (Our bosses treated.) A glass of wine and a ton of food has me feeling sleepy so I put on a new cup of coffee while going through my holiday bag, which is full of loot. Our bosses are awesome and they know the best gift is cash, so they stocked us up with gift cards and prepaid Visas. I kind of adore them. 4 p.m. \u2013 Just got a notification that the pup is home from her walk and a date confirms to meet at 8:30. I never made it to Jewel last night and I'm rocking old hair.

I reply that the ones on there already are from the past two weeks. He never replies and un-matches me so I guess I don't have to go on this date! I wasn't really feeling it anyway so crisis averted. I put on warm gym clothes and meet my friend again to go for a four-mile walk on the 606. 9 p.m. \u2014 Chat with Eric a little; he's feeling pretty down and I feel for him.

I make a breakfast of eggs, bacon, an avocado, and a mushroom, onion, and sweet potato hash with coffee and chocolate milk. I make a triple serving of the hash because I'll eat it with lunch throughout the week. 12 p.m. \u2014 I've showered and straightened my hair and fixed my makeup. (I've become extremely proficient at showering without messing up either and using dry shampoo to extend my blowouts.) I meet up with one of my girlfriends to shop the Express sweater sale. Between my coupons and gift cards, I score four sweaters for $40, which I'll take any day! We stop by Starbucks on our walk back and I grab a Grande flat white. I've still got a gift card so it's free for me today!  $40.98 Advertisement 3 p.m. \u2014 I've got a date tonight with Shawn, my roommate's boyfriend's boss tonight, at a swanky Italian place downtown. I both love and hate dating, and I always seem to be ensnarled with some guy who is broken, meaning I'm super nervous. Eric has a holiday party tonight near his ex-fianc\u00e9's apartment and he's stressed out, so we chat to help each other calm down. He knows I'm going on a date and he respects it. 7 p.m. \u2014 Hop in a Lyft, which is surging because it's holiday season in Chicago. I refuse to pay $17 to go downtown so I go with Lyft Line, which is still higher than normal.  $7.56 11:45 p.m. \u2014 We're just leaving the date and we pretty much shut the restaurant down. He was a ton of fun, we had several apps and entrees, and three bottles of wine which he let me pick so overall the meal was amazing. I offered to split the $380 tab, but was politely told not to worry about it. I'm from the South and I love a gentleman, but what's interesting to me is more men in Atlanta took me up on splitting the check than men do in Chicago. I've only had one man let me in my six months here, and I think it's because neither of us was feeling it. 1 a.m. \u2013 We head up to a rooftop bar for a nightcap although he has to get up early in the morning. He grabs the check while I'm in the bathroom. Advertisement 2 a.m. \u2014 Eric is texting me and he is drunk and upset. An amazing guy helped me through everything when my life blew up last year, so I feel like I'm restocking karma by being there for Eric. I meet him at a swanky bar ($4.07 on Uber) where he and some coworkers have ordered bottle service. I help them finish it off. Eric grabs the Uber to his place.  $4.07 Daily Total: $52.61", "day_seven": "Day Seven: 8:40 a.m. \u2014 Ugh. We're up so early for a Sunday but it's fine... Okay, not really. I put up a decent argument about why we should stay in bed. Eric normally doesn't let me spend the night, which I respect, so this is our second time waking up together \u2014 and first on the weekend \u2014 so I'm treading lightly. We take his pup out for a walk on the riverfront and then come back to bed. I have no interest in getting going early. 10:30 a.m. \u2014 We're up and moving to the couch for a  How I Met Your Mother  marathon and breakfast. I get a nasty text from Dave because to him, a breakup is never really a breakup and he knows I'm not at my apartment. 11:30 a.m. \u2014 We're finishing coffee and Eric is feeling a little overwhelmed. I've got brunch with the girls at Mott St. at 12:45, so I get ready to head out. Eric calls me an Uber and walks me downstairs. We're in a weird place but it's a nice mix of romance and friendship without feeling weighed down by expectations. Advertisement 12:30 p.m. \u2014 I am so ready for brunch. Mott St. is my favorite place, so I settle in with the girls and we catch up on dates, boys, and ridiculous Saturday night shenanigans. We each have our own entr\u00e9e and a Bloody Mary. My pork belly eggs Benny was amazing and totally hit the spot.  $28.77 2 p.m. \u2013 I settle in to finish up some work I do on the side for extra cash and binge-watch my newest show,  The Mindy Project . The pup is passed out and my cat is purring on my lap, so I immediately fall asleep instead of being productive. I wake up to a text from Shawn saying that he had fun as well on our date. We text for a few minutes before I fall back asleep. 5 p.m. \u2014 I'm at that point on a Sunday evening where I have to decide if I'm going to meet a new Bumble boy for a drink or stay in my yoga pants. I commit to my yoga pants and working, and order pizza from Papa John's with a code for free delivery. I tip $4 cash to the driver.  $13.67  7:30 p.m. \u2014 I shoot out a text to the girls from brunch asking who wants to walk off dinner. One of them lives nearby and says yes but that she needs food, and as luck would have it, I happen to have a pizza! She snags a slice and we meet our other friend at the 606 with our pups to get about three miles of walking and gossiping in. I adore the new friendships I've been able to make in this new, post-divorce life in a big city. 11:30 p.m. \u2014 I finally finish my side-hustle work and have a quick FaceTime with Eric before hitting the bed. I'm exhausted and weirdly emotional from my week of juggling men. In the really quiet moments when I'm in bed by myself falling asleep, I miss my ex-husband. Tonight is no exception, and I know I probably won't sleep that well.

I let my dogs out, feed them, and then get ready for the day. After showering and spending way too long trying to get the perfect top-knot, I rush out the door and am on my way to the office. 7:50 a.m. \u2014 Notice my car is running low on gas and make a mental note to stop at Costco on my way home from work. 8:05 a.m. \u2014 Arrive to work only a few minutes late. Someone brought in mini-donuts and I take two to eat with my protein shake for breakfast. I keep a few days' worth of breakfast, lunch, and snacks in the office fridge and replenish that every few days to avoid spending money on takeout. I also fill up my water bottle to sip on throughout the day. Advertisement 10 a.m. \u2014 Morning meetings are finished, and it looks like it's going to be a pretty light day. I'm feeling a bit snacky, so I eat a banana I brought from home and the last handful of Chex Mix that's in my desk drawer. 11 a.m. \u2014 My work bestie and I decide to run to the grocery store to pick up a few things she needs. I offer to drive so I can get gas while we're out, and I stop at Costco to fill up my very thirsty car.  $32.49 11:20 a.m. \u2014 We enjoy our time out of the office, walking around the grocery store. I don't really need any groceries but I do find GIANT kiwis that are on sale and look too good to pass up ($2.59). I also buy a bridal shower card ($4.99) for a friend.  $7.58 12 p.m. \u2014 Back at the office and feeling pretty hungry. Lunch today is half of a bagel (left over from an office party earlier this week), veggies and hummus, and a snack-size bag of Doritos from my desk drawer. 2 p.m. \u2014 I realize I haven't been drinking very much water today and refill my water bottle. When I get back to my office, I text my boyfriend to see how his day is going. He's in medical school and has been on call this whole week, so I haven't seen him very much. He replies that he has been feeling sick all day, but is planning on coming over tonight once he finishes up at the hospital. Advertisement 4:30 p.m. \u2014 Done with work for the day. On my way home, I stop at Walgreens to pick up photos I ordered to be printed. Thanks to an awesome online coupon code, I get them for a steal.  $4.99 5 p.m. \u2014 I'm finally home and my dogs are so happy to see me! I let them out and walk around my yard for a while. Once we're back inside, I feed them dinner and start hanging up clothes in my bedroom. My closet periodically explodes and after a few days of living in the chaos of clothes, shoes, and handbags everywhere, I'm relieved to finally put everything away. 5:30 p.m. \u2014 Boyfriend is home early! He doesn't officially live with me yet but has been slowly moving his stuff here over the last few months since he spends most of his nights here. I give him some kisses and then make us dinner: leftover beef brisket for him and leftover rotisserie chicken for me. 7:45 p.m. \u2014 Boyfriend passes TF out in a heap of dogs and blankets, leaving me to fend for myself for the remainder of the evening. I start cleaning the house and then go through a huge pile of mail on my desk. In the process, I decide to peruse Amazon and find anti-tarnish jewelry bags I  need . Free next-day shipping? Yes, please! ($4) I also decide to pay off my credit card early this month because the statement balance is giving me anxiety. I transfer $10,000 from savings to checking to pay off the card and replenish my checking account.  $4 Advertisement 11:15 p.m. \u2014 After watching Netflix, I decide it's time to call it a night and go to bed.

I'm too sleepy and cozy to get up, so I fall back asleep while he gets ready. 6:30 a.m. \u2014 Boyfriend wakes me up to kiss me goodbye and I get up to feed and let the dogs out. While they eat, I turn on some tunes and hop in the shower. I started a new skincare routine recently and look forward to using all my new products each morning. Up until a few weeks ago, I had never used toner before and WOW, what a difference it makes! 7:45 a.m. \u2014 I'm running late as usual but decide to make a smoothie with fruit in my fridge that's getting overripe. I have a Vitamix and it's my most-used appliance by far. It's definitely an investment, but I can make everything from almond butter to soup \u2014 and of course smoothies. One strawberry-banana-pineapple smoothie later, I say goodbye to my pups for the day and drive to work. 8:30 a.m. \u2014 I sip on my smoothie with a side of leftover donut holes as I read through emails. I only have to work until around noon today, but next week is really busy with client meetings. I want to get as much done as possible so I don't feel stressed next week. Advertisement 10:30 a.m. \u2014 Boyfriend and I have been looking at engagement rings recently and found a few options we're considering. I receive a call from the jeweler we're working with and make plans to meet with her after work. 12:30 p.m. \u2014 I'm done with work for the day and head over to the jewelry store. Boyfriend and I are forgoing tradition when it comes buying my engagement ring. He has a ton of medical school debt and won't actually be making any money until he begins residency next year. We want to get engaged soon, so while we agreed to split the cost of the ring, I'm actually going to be paying for it in its entirety; he'll pay me his half once he has a job. 1 p.m. \u2014 I'm meeting with my awesome jeweler and am able to narrow the options down to two different settings and two different diamonds. I'll be back tomorrow with my boyfriend and he'll make the final decision. 2:30 p.m. \u2014 Stop at the grocery store on my way home to pick up dessert to bring to a family party tomorrow night. It's that time of year, so there's pumpkin pie galore! ($8.40) Also notice a Christmas-themed headband with cat ears on it, which seems like a necessary purchase, and add that to my cart as well ($12.49). You never know when you might need to wear a headband with cat ears, and I always like to be prepared.  $20.89 6 p.m. \u2014 Boyfriend is home, exhausted, and still sick. We usually go out for dinner on Fridays but decide to make do with what we have in the fridge. He eats leftover taco dip and butternut squash ravioli, and I have rotisserie chicken again with French bread. Advertisement 10:30 p.m. \u2014 We end our day after watching a few episodes of  American Horror Story  and cuddling on the couch with the pups. He's tired, I'm tired, and we turn in earlier than usual. Daily Total: $20.89", "day_three": "Day Three: 7:30 a.m. \u2014 It's the weekend! I sleep in and spend time browsing Instagram and getting all of the puppy snuggles. Boyfriend already left for the hospital for the day but will hopefully be back early this afternoon. 8:30 a.m. \u2014 I finally get out of bed to let the dogs out and feed them, before making an egg sandwich for breakfast. Aside from my Vitamix, my egg sandwich maker is my second most-used appliance. 12:30 p.m. \u2014 The house is clean, the laundry is done, and I'm hungry. I text boyfriend to see when he will be home and make lunch in the meantime. We're going to a family party tonight where there will be plenty of unhealthy food choices, so I make a salad with random ingredients I have in the fridge. I watch YouTube videos while I munch. 1:30 p.m. \u2014 Boyfriend is finished at the hospital. We decide to meet at the jewelry store to finalize the engagement ring purchase since it's on his way home and we're short on time. 3 p.m. \u2014 We found the ring! Boyfriend and I both ended up liking the same diamond and setting, and I'm so excited to take the next step with him. He's the best. I have tiny, infant-like fingers so my ring has to be specially ordered and won't be ready for six to eight weeks. Twenty percent down is due today, and I plan to pay the remaining balance off over the next few weeks. We ask the jeweler to call my boyfriend when it's ready so he can pick it up and still have some element of surprise for the engagement.  $2,800 Advertisement 4:30 p.m. \u2014 Boyfriend and I are rushing to get to the party on time, and I realize I forgot Cool Whip for the pie. We stop at the grocery store on the way so I can get some, along with my favorite frozen Red's burritos that are on sale.  $7.45 8 p.m. \u2014 Thoroughly enjoying ourselves with my family, eating good food, laughing, and talking. We eat our weight in pizza and snacks my parents bought and enjoy the dessert I brought. Boyfriend has one too many glasses of wine and ends up spilling red wine on himself and my cousin's nice, fluffy rug. We will likely not be invited back anytime soon. 11 p.m. \u2014 We're home and snuggle in bed with the pups and watch Netflix before falling asleep.

If they could talk, I'm sure they'd be cursing me because I slept in so late. Boyfriend got up around 5 and has already been at the hospital for a few hours. I take out turkey chili from the freezer to thaw for dinner tonight. I usually make a crockpot full every few months, portion it out, and freeze it. 9:30 a.m. \u2014 I make scrambled eggs and turkey bacon for breakfast and watch YouTube videos on my phone while I eat. I receive a text from my parents reminding me to book my flight for our upcoming family vacation to Florida. When confirming the dates with them, I realize we're leaving on my boyfriend's birthday. Worst. Girlfriend. Ever. Advertisement 10:30 a.m. \u2014 Why is air travel so expensive?! I book a Southwest flight to Florida and call my parents to let them know. After I get off the phone, I schedule boarding for my dogs. When I travel, my parents are usually the ones who watch my pups, but since we will all be gone it's off to the kennel they go. I'm quoted nearly $600 (yikes!), but I don't have to pay until the day I drop them off.  $393.95 11:30 a.m. \u2014 Decide to start decluttering my bathroom cabinets. It's amazing how many products one girl can accumulate, and even more amazing how few are actually used on a daily basis. I fill a couple of bags: one to donate, one to throw out. I also clear an entire shelf and drawer for boyfriend's things so he doesn't have to keep shoving his stuff in a small travel bag. 1 p.m. \u2014 I heat up one of the frozen burritos I bought yesterday for lunch and sit down to watch Netflix. I've recently become hooked on  Grey's Anatomy  and I plan to spend a couple of hours vegging out and relaxing. 4:30 p.m. \u2014 After wasting much more of the day than I should have, I decide to get some exercise and take my dogs for a walk. It's so cold outside; winter is coming! My dogs weigh about 25 pounds combined, but when we walk, they manage to pull me along like a 100-pound Labrador. 5:15 p.m. \u2014 I'm back from our walk and start meal prepping for the week. I make overnight oats for breakfast, egg sandwiches for lunch, and cut up peppers and sugar snap peas for snacks. I also pack extra protein shakes, apples, and oranges, and a few pieces of chocolate for when 3 o'clock rolls around and I need my sugar fix. Advertisement 6:30 p.m. \u2014 Boyfriend is home from the hospital and looks exhausted. I heat up the chili from the freezer for us and pack lunch for him for tomorrow. He's getting homemade zucchini bread, Greek yogurt, chili, and a banana. Once the chili is ready, we eat together and catch up on our days. 8 p.m. \u2014 After cleaning up the kitchen, we settle on the couch with the pups and watch  Home Alone . We both pass out about 30 minutes into the movie and decide to give up and go to bed early.

I reluctantly crawl out of bed to let the pups out. After they do their doggie business and I feed them, I hop in the shower to get ready for work. Boyfriend is still home and offers to make me breakfast since we have some very ripe bananas we need to use up. Banana pancakes for the win! 8:11 a.m. \u2014 Arrive to work an put my meals for the week away in the fridge. I read through emails from the weekend and chat with some of my coworkers. Today is a busy day with five client meetings back to back and a client event tonight. 1:15 p.m. \u2014 My office ordered lunch from Panera and I have time in between meetings to chow down. I usually get a ton of free food at work; someone always seems to bring something in or buy lunch for everyone. I ordered a chicken Caesar salad with a ton of toppings and it is so delicious! Advertisement 1:30 p.m. \u2014 While eating lunch, I peruse the Nordstrom website and notice that a Michele watch I've been eyeing for over a year is deeply discounted. I know I probably shouldn't do it, but I can't pass it up and add it to my cart ($1,678.43). I also place a large Amazon order of Christmas presents for my boyfriend. I go a bit overboard this year, but the guy needs everything! I buy him new Asics running shoes, Bogs winter boots, work ties, and new shirts ($285.18).  $1,963.61 4:30 p.m. \u2014 I wrap up at the office for the day and head to the venue for the client event tonight. It's at a nice bar, but since I don't drink I'm going to socialize and make sure everyone else has a good time. 6 p.m. \u2014 Enjoying my guilty pleasure, Diet Coke. There's a bunch of yummy hors-d'oeuvres for me to munch on, too. I eat enough for a respectable dinner. 9:15 p.m. \u2014 Finally home. My parents are watching my dogs for me, and my boyfriend is working overnight at the hospital so I'm all alone. It's eerily quiet in my house so I turn on the TV for background noise while I clean up around the house. 10:45 p.m. \u2014 In bed and browsing Facebook, and notice my local movie theater is offering $5 Christmas movies for the next month. My boyfriend and I love  Elf  and  National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation  so I buy tickets for us for two different weekends.  $20 Advertisement 11:15 p.m. \u2014 I can't keep my eyes open anymore; bedtime.

They're SO good. I text my boyfriend good morning and read through emails. 12:15 p.m. \u2014 A few client meetings later and it's time for lunch. I'm not in the mood for the egg sandwiches I made so I eat a frozen microwaveable meal I've had at the office for a month too long. It tastes pretty bad and I end up throwing half of it out and snacking on other things in my office drawer \u2014 a combination of pistachios and turkey jerky. I also eat one of the oranges I brought from home. 4 p.m. \u2014 I finish my last meeting of the day a little early and head out to go Christmas shopping. I go to TJ Maxx to find things for my parents. I get my mom a bracelet, a pair of dressy winter gloves, chocolates she likes, and a candle ($55.35). There is literally nothing here for my dad. I also buy a few home decor items and ornaments.  $117.85 6:15 p.m. \u2014 On my way home, I stop at the pet supply store to buy dog food.

After unloading my car, I preheat the oven and get out the ingredients to make garlic bread. Once that's baking, I heat up some turkey meat sauce I had in the freezer. Boyfriend has been home for a while and is functioning surprisingly well on very little sleep. We eat together and then play with the dogs. 7:45 p.m. \u2014 After cleaning up the kitchen, I do laundry while boyfriend packs. He is leaving tomorrow for a residency program interview, literally across the country. It's crazy to think that this time next year, we could potentially be living in an entirely different state, with new jobs and a new home. We're really hoping to stay in the Midwest but don't have complete control over the situation; it's unnerving not knowing. 9 p.m. \u2014 Boyfriend and I relax on the couch and watch some episodes of  Grey's Anatomy .

Only a few more meetings to go. 2 p.m. \u2014 I heat up an egg sandwich and take it back to my desk for lunch. While I'm eating, I text my boyfriend as he waits at the airport for his flight to leave. I also sign up to volunteer tomorrow night after work. I tend to volunteer a lot more when he's not around to keep myself busy and distracted in the evening. Coming home to an empty house when you're not used to it isn't fun! 4 p.m. \u2014 I finish my last meeting of the day. I want to stop at a few stores for Christmas presents before I go to my personal training session, so I leave work a bit early. 4:30 p.m. \u2014 I'm at a different TJ Maxx and they have a ton of good stuff! I pick up a few more things for my boyfriend and mom. The find of the evening? A mug with a cat wearing a sweater that says \"Meowy Christmas\" on it!

I also find some more home decor items for Christmas.  $171.82 Advertisement 5:30 p.m. \u2014 Make a quick stop at Target to look around, vowing to not get sucked into the Target vortex.

I pre-pay for four sessions at a time and then schedule them as needed. We've been working on improving my flexibility.

I don't know what to eat for dinner so I preheat the oven and throw in a frozen pizza. While it's cooking, I play with my pups. They're pretty wound up tonight even though my boyfriend was home with them for the better part of the day. One of my dogs uses me as a trampoline and launches herself off of me onto the couch. I think she may be half baby goat. 7:05 p.m. \u2014 My pizza is done and I'm comfortably settled into my usual spot on the couch surrounded by dogs. I'm not in the mood to watch  Grey 's tonight, so I opt for the movie  Four Christmases .

I'm usually a very early bird \u2014 I love to get up before the sun and have time for quiet, coffee, breakfast, etc. \u2014 but I was up really late last night and slept in today. 9:45 a.m. \u2014 Make a pot of coffee and heat up breakfast. I have leftover whole-wheat banana bread topped with peanut butter, plus an orange and some sesame honey cashews. And coffee. I bring it back to bed and eat while I read a few  New York Times  articles and catch up on Bravo shows I've missed this week. Not a bad start to the day! 11:30 a.m. \u2014 Text my friend about our plans for the afternoon. She's my best friend and lives right down the block from me, but we've both had busy weeks and haven't seen each other. I'm ready for some girl time! Advertisement 11:45 a.m. \u2014 Swing by the library to pick up the books I had on hold (a biography of Franklin D. Roosevelt and two  Thug Kitchen  cookbooks) since I have a few minutes before my friend is ready to go. 12 p.m. \u2014 Parking is crazy where we planned to go, so we detour to a local brewery we've never been to. It was a little bit of a hike but the beer was awesome. We chat about the book she's writing and admire the strangely violent murals on the walls. I pay.  $23 3 p.m. \u2014 I'm hangry when I get home, so I make the quickest thing I can think of: rye toast and eggs scrambled with cheddar cheese, and hazelnut chocolate for dessert. 4 p.m. \u2014 I've been feeling super strange lately, kind of unsure of myself, insecure, self-critical, like I don't even know myself or what I want. Even though I love spending time with my best friend, she is so sure of herself and confident that I sometimes feel unsteady in comparison. I remind myself to contact a counseling office I've bookmarked to schedule an appointment. I can't tell if these are normal late-20s feelings or if I'm really struggling. I turn on  Gilmore Girls  to comfort myself and try not to get too wrapped up in my head. I've gotta get it together for a date tonight! 4:15 p.m. \u2014 I spontaneously buy the 1 Second Everyday app after seeing an adorable video on someone's Instagram story. I have no idea what to take videos of though! I guess this will challenge me to be creative. I'll start tomorrow.  $5.28 Advertisement 5 p.m. \u2014 Hop in the shower and get ready for my date. I cannot decide what to wear (see struggling feelings above) and try on approximately three outfits before settling on an old faithful: a black jumpsuit with a chunky cardigan. Curl my hair and put on a little makeup. 5:30 p.m. \u2014 My date is cooking steak fajitas for dinner, and I'm in charge of bringing chips and salsa. I swing by the store on the way and get them both, plus a pack of gum for my purse.  $8.97 10:30 p.m. \u2014 Home! I had a good time on the date but am having a hard time figuring out if I like this guy and can see long-term potential. I feel like having to think to hard about it probably does not bode well. I eat a little more chocolate before crashing. Daily Total: $37.25", "day_two": "Day Two: 8:30 a.m. \u2014 Wake up, make coffee, and toast a TJ's multigrain bagel for breakfast. I put clarified french butter on one side (I don't even know what really this is, but damn is it good!) and peanut butter on the other. I also grab an apple. Somehow, I threw out my back between last night and this morning, so I hobble around a little bit. I scheduled a barre class through ClassPass for later today. If I cancel, I have to pay a fee of $15 so I hope it feels better soon. 9 a.m. \u2014 I hop in the car to run to a few grocery stores. It's a long weekend and I want to do a bunch of cooking projects, so I need to stock up and get the best prices! I drive 20 minutes or so out to the best Aldi in Virginia and get ingredients for my recipes and some other essentials for the week ($60.80). I also stop at Target for paper towels, sponges, and one of those assorted cereal packs my family used to bring on vacation. I'm going to make cereal milk ice cream! ($11.59) The last stop is Trader Joe's for frozen leeks, broccoli florets, parsnips, and heavy cream ($12.14).  $84.53 Advertisement 11 a.m. \u2014 I turn on Spotfiy, unpack the groceries, and start on the base for the cereal milk ice cream. 11:30 a.m. \u2014 My friends and I spent a week at the beach together last year, and it was so fun that we're doing it again this year! I'm in charge of coordinating/booking. I send out an email to the group with logistics and ask them to Venmo me their share of the rental, which I put on my credit card last week. 1:30 p.m. \u2014 Made it through barre class without throwing out my back. Small victories. 2 p.m. \u2014 Random lunch full of things in the fridge: a big kale salad with cranberries, goat cheese, almonds, and sweet potatoes with homemade vinaigrette, plus a kiwi. 2:30 p.m. \u2014 I make a batch of cereal milk ice cream (I dream of opening my own ice cream shop one day!), with a cereal crumble to mix in. I let everything sit in the fridge overnight. I'll churn it tomorrow. 5 p.m. \u2014 Make an early dinner of Trader Joe's frozen cauliflower fried rice with a scrambled egg added and kung pao chicken, both topped with sriracha. I love that this meal crushes my takeout cravings at a fraction of the cost, and with more veggies to boot. 5:30 p.m. \u2014 I have a shift at the restaurant tonight, so I shower, get ready, and drive over there. I would love to stay home or go out for a beer with my friend, but I remind myself that this money will help pay for my beach trip! Plus, we don't have school tomorrow because it's MLK Jr. Day, so I can sleep in a little. Advertisement 12:15 a.m. \u2014 Home, and so damn tired. I wash my face, put on PJs, and head to bed.

I'm feeling strangely motivated when I wake up, so after I put in my contacts, wash my face, and brush my teeth, I do a deep clean of the bathroom and throw in a load of laundry. Then on to coffee and a comforting bowl of oatmeal with bananas, dates, chia, flax, and peanut butter. I also churn the ice cream I made yesterday and stick it in the freezer. 9 a.m. \u2014 I'm feeling stressed about this beach trip. I kind of wish that I hadn't agreed to it and had instead devoted the money to a new trip somewhere different this year, but I got swept in. This was an instance when I definitely could have practiced being more assertive instead of going with the flow, which is my natural inclination. I know it will be a ton of fun when I get there, though. 9:30 a.m. \u2014 Wash the huge pile of dishes in the sink, then do some more cooking for the week: Joy the Baker's turkey meatballs, broccoli with garlic and olive oil, and farro. 11 a.m. \u2014 Shower and get ready for the day. I drive downtown to spend the afternoon in a few of my favorite Smithsonian museums, but as soon as I get there I realize that may not be possible. There is not single a parking spot to be found for blocks! I'm still glad to drive around and swing by the Dr. MLK Jr. memorial on this holiday. Advertisement 12:15 p.m. \u2014 Instead of my museum plan, I take myself out to one of my favorite restaurants for a burger and a toasted marshmallow milkshake. Seriously, it's heaven on earth. I didn't order fries but I think the cashier made a mistake (or was really nice/flirty!) and gave me some! I sit by the window and read my book,  The Sound and the Fury , and people watch while I eat. I leave feeling full but satisfied.  $13.89 2 p.m. \u2014 Call my dad on the drive home and vent about feeling down. He is a great listener and knows exactly what to say. 2:30 p.m. \u2014 Take a long, hot bubble bath with my book and a can of sparkling water \u2014 one of my favorite self-care activities. I also spend like 15 minutes  feeling the feelings  (read: crying uncontrollably), but I feel a lot better after. 3:15 p.m. \u2014 Paint my nails and watch a few episodes of  The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel . Why didn't I start this show sooner?! The script, wardrobe, and acting are all so good. Also, Tony Shalhoub! 5:15 p.m. \u2014 Snack on an apple, still kind of full from lunch. Feeling fancy, I put on two face masks in a row \u2014 a fun, peel-off one followed by one from The Ordinary that makes me look like a newborn alien. 7 p.m. \u2014 Prep snacks for me and my friend to eat; she's coming over to watch  The Bachelor  tonight. I cut up veggies, cheese, leftover banana bread, and pop a big bowl of stovetop popcorn. I never watch  The Bachelor  on the night of, so this is a treat! I also definitely need some social time (but there was no way was I putting on a bra and/or real pants again today). Advertisement 10 p.m. \u2014 I love my friend. She gives great advice and is so funny and supportive. We had a blast judging Arie's awkward kisses and catching up on each other's weeks. 10:30 p.m. \u2014 My nighttime skincare routine is already done; all that's left is to take out my contacts and hop into bed. Getting up for work tomorrow will not be easy\u2026 Daily Total: $13.89", "day_four": "Day Four: 5:45 a.m. \u2014 Wake up and get going with the morning routine. Put my contacts in, remember to take my calcium pill (I never know if it helps), wash my face, etc. I put on a pot of coffee and make my bed, then start putting on skincare stuff and decide on an outfit and breakfast. It's going to be a balmy 40 degrees today after a brutally cold weekend, so I decide to wear ankle-length pants. I like to live on the edge. 6:30 a.m. \u2014 Sip on my first cup of coffee and pack up my lunch for work. I have a really tasty breakfast that I hope will fill me up for a busy morning: TJ's multigrain bagel (half with butter and half with peanut butter) with two fried eggs, and a sliced pear. I also look over my weekend spending on Mint, something I do every morning, if not multiple times per day. I could probably ease up a little bit on this, but I stress out about money so much that tracking every penny of my spending gives me some peace of mind. Advertisement 6:45 a.m. \u2014 I need to leave a few minutes early to fill my gas tank on the way to work. I live in D.C. but work in the suburbs of Virginia, so I have a pretty long commute. I just started listening to Jeffery Eugenides' new short story collection, so the drive isn't so bad today!  $24.52 7:30 a.m. \u2014 Get settled at work and drink my second cup of coffee from a travel mug. My job is really stressful sometimes, but I mostly love it. We have a department meeting first thing and plan for our upcoming registration. It's good to catch up with my coworkers after a long weekend and get back in a routine. There are murmurs of a possible snow day tomorrow, but I'm not counting my chickens! 10:30 a.m. \u2014 I check on a student whose mental health I'm worried about, help another track down a spare textbook from a math teacher, and respond to parent emails. Then I meet with a new student and her dad to show her around the school and talk about the classes she will take. 12:45 p.m. \u2014 I was hungry for lunch about an hour ago, but I got sidetracked with students who needed to see me. Then I had to \u201cwalk\u201d (read: escort) a student to in-school suspension. So goes the life of a school counselor! When I get back to my office, I see that my sweet coworker left me her soft pretzel; they come with school lunches but she didn't want hers and knows I love them. I eat that in approximately five seconds, then move on to the lunch I prepped yesterday while I read emails. Advertisement 1:30 p.m. \u2014 I like something sweet in the afternoon, so I have a small apple and a piece of chocolate one of my students gave me for Christmas. I also make a cup of decaf coffee to sip on while I rush around to meetings this afternoon. 3:30 p.m. \u2014 Feeling so snacky today! I eat a little slice of leftover whole wheat banana bread and a few crackers with cheese. I always pack extra things like this in my lunchbox in case of a snack attack. 4:30 p.m. \u2014 I decide to run the few miles over to my ClassPass class tonight, which is a spin class at Flywheel. It's not too far and mostly downhill from my apartment \u2014 plus, parking is a nightmare near the studio. I tell myself I'll walk or take the bus home if I'm too pooped after class is over. 5:30 p.m. \u2014 Great spin class! I leave dripping in sweat, feeling strong and grateful for a body that is able to do lots of different things. 6:15 p.m. \u2014 Grab a free apple on the way out of the studio to sustain me for my walk home. My phone recently started to spontaneously die when the weather is cold, so I spend the quiet walk home making a to-do list in my head, thinking over the day, and wondering if we'll have a snow day tomorrow. 7 p.m. \u2014 Get home and start preparing vegetable pot pie for dinner! I'm using a  Thug Kitchen  recipe, so it's vegan \u2014 except I use regular pie crust, because pie crust must have butter in my humble opinion. I just put it in the oven to bake when my friend calls. We're both smart ladies who love trashy reality television, so we chat for a bit about the finale of  RelationShep  on Bravo. She makes me laugh like crazy. Advertisement 8 p.m. \u2014 Take a quick shower, put on PJs, and serve myself dinner. It is delicious! I finish the night off by taste testing some of the cereal milk ice cream from yesterday. Oh man, is it good. The buttery cereal crumble tears up the roof of my mouth a little bit, but that's a good problem to have, I think. 9:30 p.m. \u2014 Put on my retinol cream, take out my contacts, and hit the hay, hoping for a snow day tomorrow.

It felt so good to sleep in and still beat my alarm. I make a pot of coffee and a more time-intensive breakfast: a bowl of oatmeal with chia, flax, cinnamon, half a banana, and a scoop of peanut butter. I eat, drink my coffee, read blogs, and check my budget. I'm still waiting on a return credit for a pricey jacket I returned a week or two ago, but it's not in yet. Grr! I check my email and see that the store is trying to send me a store credit card instead of refunding the money to my credit card. Frustrated, I email customer service to see what they can do. I see that a Madewell order for a pair of jeans I was waitlisted for went through. (The hassle of needing tall sizes!) I got them for a great deal during a 30% off sale, though, so I didn't mind waiting. I update my budget spreadsheet with these purchases.  $59.48 Advertisement 8 a.m. \u2014 Start getting ready for work. I have extra time and decide to put a few curls in my hair. Drink one more cup of coffee before leaving. 10 a.m. \u2014 Drop off my stuff in my office, then show my new student to all of her classes. Go to a meeting, see a few students, and prep for things happening next week. 12 p.m. \u2014 Eat lunch before I have to head down to cover the cafeteria. I eat the same things as yesterday plus an orange and carrots on the side. 1 p.m. \u2014 I have a meeting at our county office this afternoon, so I leave school. On my way I stop at one of my very favorite places: Wegmans! As a born and raised Rochesterian, this is a big deal for me, and definitely worth going out of my way through the Northern Virginia suburbs. I have plans to take myself to a movie tonight, which requires gummy candies and maybe chocolate. I pick and choose some favorites from the bulk section and also grab a twelve-pack of diet root beer, gum, a big bag of epsom salts, heavy cream, and malted milk powder to make more ice cream. Can't stop, won't stop.  $20.61 2:30 p.m. \u2014 Leave the county office and head home. I have the whole afternoon ahead of me! In a flash of creativity, I start brainstorming my maid of honor speech for my best friend's wedding. It's not until the fall but great memories and ideas popped into my brain randomly this afternoon. I make a voice recording on my phone so I don't forget! Advertisement 3:15 p.m. \u2014 Well, crap. Apparently Aritzia only gives store credit for returned sale items. I'm kicking myself for not checking the policy more carefully, and mad that I won't get the money back, which I wanted to put towards my larger than normal credit card bill this month. I guess it's good I have store credit, but I never even really shop here. Sigh. Lesson learned. 3:30 p.m. \u2014 Dust my apartment, Swiffer the floors, water my plant, fold laundry. I also pay a bill from my doctor's office. I thought I had a yeast infection last month (I didn't, thank goodness!) so my doctor ordered labs that insurance only partially covered. I try to have as many zero-spend days as possible in a month (which I'm doing a very bad job of this week). Since I've already spent money today, I figure I might as well check off this.  $38.15 4:15 p.m. \u2014 Getting pretty hungry so I eat leftover roasted sweet potatoes and watch an episode of  The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel . Take a break to call my best friend and wish her luck on a job interview. I make a batch of malted vanilla ice cream and a pan of boxed brownies that I'm going to chop up and mix in. 5 p.m. \u2014 Early bird dinner: leftover cauliflower fried rice and kung pao chicken. 5:30 p.m. \u2014 I'm feeling a little cooped up and I decide to get fresh air and exercise by walking 35-ish minutes down to the Loft store to see what's new. I don't need to buy anything immediately but I am in the market for a new skirt or two, a pair of work pants, and a sweater. It's freezing out so I walk quickly and get my heart pumping! Advertisement 6:30 p.m. \u2014 Struck out at Loft, which is a good thing for my budget. I decide it's too cold to walk to and from the movie theater like I planned. I'll have to see  Call Me By Your Name  another time. I head home and swing by the library to pick up a few more holds that came in. 7:30 p.m. \u2014 When I get home, I churn up my ice cream, adding the brownie pieces and a caramel swirl, and stick it in containers in the freezer to share with friends and coworkers. Then I take a bath, eat some of the movie gummies I bought earlier, flip through cookbooks, and listen to a podcast. I text my brother about coming over to pick up ice cream tomorrow, text a bit with a few friends, and do a little browsing on OkCupid. 9:15 p.m. \u2014 In bed reading my book.

I want to be more consistent with this habit \u2014 usually I'm great for about three weeks and then I totally stop. I'm visiting my brother in Paris in April, so that is motivation to practice my rusty high school French! I'm also trying to learn Spanish because a lot of the students and families I work with are from Latin America, so maybe I'll alternate which language I practice each day. I was taking a Spanish class but it got too expensive, so this will be a good free way to practice.

Get on the road to work a few minutes later than I was hoping to. 8 a.m. \u2014 Drink my second cup of coffee during my first meeting of the day. 11 a.m. \u2014 This morning has been crazy stressful. I'm trying to do ten things at once (see students, prep for registration, make schedule changes, plan a baby shower potluck for a coworker) and I feel like I'm not making progress on any of it. I'm already hungry at 11, so I eat an orange and crackers to tide me over until lunch, and keep plugging away. 12 p.m. \u2014 Lunch is leftover veggie pot pie with a spinach salad on the side. A little while after lunch, I eat a small apple and dark chocolate leftover from Christmas. I update my budget spreadsheet over lunch and read one of my favorite money-related websites, The Billfold. 5:15 p.m. \u2014 I have to meet with a student's parents and a teacher after school, which keeps me there way later than usual; it happens. My best friend asks if I can pick her up from campus on the way home. It's on my way and it's freezing out (she hates the cold!) so I tell her no problem. She stops at my apartment to pick up ice cream before heading home. 6 p.m. \u2014 I text a parent about tutoring her son and arrange to meet this Saturday. The extra money will be great! Advertisement 6:30 p.m. \u2014 Go over to my friend's apartment for dinner. She feeds me leftover baked ziti and salad, which obviously tastes amazing because it wasn't made by me! We drink a beer and plan a potential summer program for rising high-school seniors. She's a great writing teacher and we think we could make money by doing a weeklong college application and essay bootcamp together. We brainstorm for a while and half-watch what might be the worst show ever made,  Hart of Dixie . 8:30 p.m. \u2014 Walk home, take a shower, and start winding down. I taste test a little bit of the ice cream I made yesterday. It is so good, oh my goodness. New favorite flavor.

And coffee, obviously. Check Mint, transfer my Venmo balance to my bank, and read blogs. 7:30 a.m. \u2014 Get to work a little early. Sip coffee in my travel mug and try to evaluate a few students' transcripts before a busy day of meetings. A sweet student gave me a Starbucks gift card yesterday for helping him with something, so I add that and a few others I had from Christmas to the app on my phone. Easier than juggling separate cards which very well could fall into the black hole that is my purse. Remind myself to write him a thank-you note later. 7:45 a.m. \u2014 Text with my friend who is considering getting bangs. I used to have super full bangs and loved them. Seeing the new  Fifty Shades of Grey  trailer has made me want them again in a big way. The movies may be problematic, but damn, Anastasia Steele has good hair! I remember how annoying bangs can be, though, especially once you decide you no longer want them. What to do?! 12 p.m. \u2014 My coworkers and I actually are able to sit down for 20 minutes to eat lunch together. Miracle of miracles! I love chatting with them, but we're all so busy that it doesn't happen often. I have leftovers again and I'm looking forward to a new lunch next week. I eat quickly because I have to run to another meeting at 12:30. 1:45 p.m. \u2014 Snack on a few brownie pieces and an apple to power me through the rest of my afternoon meetings. 3:15 p.m. \u2014 So glad it's the weekend. I blast old school John Mayer on the drive home (embarrassing) and consider how I'd like to spend my evening. 4:30 p.m. \u2014 Change into workout clothes and go for a walk. It's beautiful out; the sun is setting and it's still in the low 50s. I stop by an ATM to deposit cash, then walk for 30 minutes or so. while chatting with my parents on the phone.

Throughout my pregnancy, I didn't have any cravings. I pretty much ate the same and often times felt like eating and deciding what to eat was a chore. Now that i'm finally at 37 weeks, the snack cravings are intense and consistent. We first stop at Whole Foods, where I'm very disgruntled to not find pizzelle cookies anywhere since I'm specifically craving those. I am later torn about a $17 bag of pistachios. I really want them ... but not for $17! I wistfully circle the wine aisle for old time's sake and we finally go home with good ole weekly staples: salmon, steak, cereal, milk, broccoli, oranges, mandarins, roasted coffee beans, hummus, and a rotisserie chicken. I tell my husband that I am very disappointed about the $17 pistachios and lack of pizzelles and we decide to go to Trader Joe's to get our snack fix.  $110 12:45 p.m. \u2014 Ah, Trader Joe's. How I love thee. Pre-pregnancy, I made a point of banning snacks in our house. Now that I'm on the last few weeks of my pregnancy, all bets are off. It's quite freeing to not worry about the state of my abs to be honest.

Months seven and eight, I was lucky enough to buy a monthly Uber pass for $15 that offers $5 off every Uber Pool. I live in the city and my workplace is a short highway ride away so I've been able to score rides for as low as $2. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to get one for this month, so no discount. I'm way too uncomfortable to take public transportation to work and the truth of the matter is everyone is too absorbed in their cell phones to ever give up their seat for me. I count my daily Uber rides as a necessary health and mental pregnancy expense.  $6.75 6 p.m. \u2014 My UberPool home tonight was interesting. As I got out of the car, the other rider asked if I live in \"that house.\" When I said yes, he replied that he lived there about three years ago. I wanted to stop and talk but was already halfway out of the car. When I get inside, I tell my husband that I think I shared an Uber with an old tenant of ours. My husband and I own a two-family house and we rent out the second floor to tenants to help us with our $4,000 mortgage. (Technically our mortgage is $3,800 but we refinanced it to a 20-year one and pay an extra $225 every month in the hopes paying it off sooner.) I remember the Uber driver confirming the other rider's name when he got in, and my husband and I remember who he is at the same time. He worked for a luxury company, partied all the time, and made a hole in the kitchen wall. We hated him.  $7.50 Advertisement Daily Total: $14.25", "day_three": "Day Three: 12:30 p.m. \u2014 I get to work from home today as I have a doctor's appointment; my OB is now doing a pelvis exam at every visit to see how dilated I am. Last week's exam was extremely uncomfortable but quick. When she reached up to feel my cervix, however, I make a noise \u2014not quite a scream but it definitely in the realm of \"Argh!\" She pulls out earlier than she wants and tells me that next week she'll try to position me better to really feel for it. She also says she thinks I'm about one centimeter dilated. which isn't a lot but I'm glad. I don't want the baby to come any earlier! I pay $6 for parking and then go home to work a bit. My snacking is intense today: I polish off the bag of pistachios and half the box of almond butter cookies. I finally put away the latter when I realize I'm feeling a bit sick. Apparently you can eat too much of a good thing.  $6 5 p.m. \u2014 I realize I am running out of Bio-Oil and order more on Amazon Prime.

It's nice to pull the \"I'm pregnant\" card. I make oatmeal with an egg swirled in and sweeten it with coconut sugar. I usually eat cereal with milk but since I have access to my kitchen, I'm being a little more decadent. After eating half a box of almond butter cookies last night, my craving for it has completely disappeared, but I do want something to snack on. I decide to bake seasoned sweet potato fries. 2:30 p.m. \u2014 Husband and I have been very lucky to have incredibly generous family and friends who gave us a lot of presents and great hand-me-down for my baby shower. As a result, we haven't needed to buy the baby anything other two Ikea drawers to put in the nursery. The one thing we do want to splurge on is a baby stroller. When I first found out about the world of expensive baby strollers from a friend, I scoffed and said, \"Not me! I would never spend that much!\" Egg. On. My. Face. After much research, we decided to go with Uppababy Vista because you can put as many as three kids in the same carriage. We both know we want more than one child and we figure we are saving money in the long run buying one stroller instead of multiple. (That's what we tell ourselves anyway.) We finally buy it with a 20% coupon.  $725 6:30 p.m. \u2014 For dinner we make miso salmon with a brown rice-quinoa medley. We try to eat dinner at home on the weekdays to save money.

I'm fully aware that I am on the cusp of a life-changing event but sometimes I think I'm a bit in denial. I know I'm only weeks away from my due date but I feel like I haven't really processed it yet. I ponder over this during my ride to work.  $7.50 12 p.m. \u2014 Lunch is rotisserie chicken and hummus from home. It's easy, fast, and cheap and pretty much what I get every week when I grocery shop.

It's my last ride home from work for awhile! It feels bittersweet ... not. It just feels sweet. I am so excited to not work for two weeks before my due date.  $14.50 8:30 p.m. \u2014 It's Fri-yay which means husband and I are going out to eat for dinner.We decide to go to our neighborhood Japanese restaurant that does izakaya. We are so lucky to have a great variety of Asian food where we live, and we go to this restaurant so often that the waitstaff knows us. Unfortunately, we don't know them enough that we get to waltz in and cut the line when it's crowded, but they do grace us with head nods and waves. We always go HAM when we order here. Today, we get our usual staples of ramen, fried oysters, cod roe pasta, sushi (for the husband), fries with roe sauce, Japanese steak, and Omusoba.

It changes the breakfast sandwich game!  $8 5:30 p.m. \u2014 We are going to a friend's potluck and pop on over to Whole Foods to buy a chicken pot pie. We also pick up beer at the local liquor store. I've taken to drinking O'Douls, a non-alcoholic beer, in social situations. I don't even like beer, but when you are pregnant and can't drink, O'Douls is a life saver.

It might be sacrilegious to say but I never loved loved dim sum pre-pregnancy. Now that I'm pregnant, I love it. We drive to another town for a restaurant known for their buns. They're made in-house and are divine: the top is sweet and crusty and inside of the bun is melted, egg yolk goodness. To be honest, I'm not sure this is something I should be eating while pregnant (because of the yolk) but I prefer to stay blissfully ignorant and enjoy it.

The search proves harder than I thought. I'm particular about the print and don't want anything too pricey as these will probably only be worn once a year during Christmas. I search online for a set of four, for my husband, myself, the dog, and the baby. I finally decide to take a chance and buy a  Star Wars  set on eBay from China. The sizing and quality could be off but it's cheap and who doesn't love  Star Wars ? I am giddy with excitement when I make the purchase. There was no matching set for the dog but my husband assures me our dog can wear a  Star Wars  costume instead. This is why I married him!  $45 Advertisement 7:30 p.m. \u2014 Husband and I decided get take-out from the local shawarma place. I get a beef gyro with rice and husband gets a chicken gyro with rice.

It's a busy time of the month at work, and I'm trying to get to my desk as early as possible. Our eight-month-old sidetracks me by waking up early, but I still manage to leave close to on time. My husband handles daycare drop-off when I'm busy and luckily, my commute is under 10 miles door-to-door, and I'm at the office by 6:15. I grab a free coffee from the work kitchen (they have free soda, coffee, and tea) and drink it with a Fiber One brownie that I keep in my desk. 9 a.m. \u2014 I grab a can of Coke Zero Sugar from the kitchen. It's probably too early for soda, but I've already been up for four hours and need the caffeine. 12 p.m. \u2014 There's a chili and cornbread cook-off in the office today! I head over with two of my favorite coworkers and sample way too much food. I vote for two members of my team (anonymity fail) and return to my desk with a mini cupcake and a LaCroix for later. 2 p.m. \u2014 I go on Amazon and finally order the baby playpen that's been in my cart for over a week now ($65), and formula ($41).

It was hard to get into, so I want to hand in our paperwork and registration fee ASAP! I leave for the day to drop off the paperwork, and grab two donuts for my husband on my way out. Someone brought them in from a local donut shop he's been wanting to visit.  $250 Advertisement 3:45 p.m. \u2014 On my way to pick up the baby, I swing by the food store, which is having a huge sale on baby food! I throw a ton of the organic baby food pouches that my son loves into my basket,  Supermarket Sweep -style. I also pick up hot kimchi for a recipe I'm making later this weekend, and white wine to go with the sushi I intend to convince my husband we need for dinner tonight.  $33.14 4:15 p.m. \u2014 Baby acquired, I call my husband to let him know we're on our way. He worked from home today while our new microwave was installed. I get home, unload the groceries, and pay the installers a tip as they finish.  $20 6 p.m. \u2014 My husband is more than willing to indulge my sushi craving, so we order an Alaska roll, an eel-avocado roll, a salmon-avocado roll, two tuna-avocado rolls, and a spicy tuna roll. I get our son ready for bed while my husband picks up the food and then we eat with the wine I picked up earlier. The sushi quality is lackluster, and we both agree that even though this place is around the corner, we need to explore better options.  $33.14 9 p.m. \u2014 Baby is finally asleep.

I should be productive, but instead, I lay in bed next to my snoring husband and scroll through my social media accounts. The baby wakes up around 7:15, and I ask my husband to take him while I heat up the bottle. We have a good routine on weekend mornings of getting the baby changed, dressed, and fed. I get myself ready and make coffee in a travel mug, and then remind my husband about the donuts from yesterday. Sadly, they don't live up to the hype.

We live close to two grocery stores, and I do most of my shopping at the less expensive one. I buy English muffins, a salad, cauliflower, eggs, an onion, chicken breasts, formula (for which I have $15 worth of coupons), a big bag of potatoes, shredded cheese, soy sauce, mustard, ranch dressing, wine, Kettle Chips, pretzels, and organic veggies for making baby food. I am back home by 9, and my husband unloads the car for me.

I also run into the market next door for a few things: chicken wings, organic frozen fruit to make baby food, and a few more baby food pouches ($24.40). I head back to CVS and wander through the store (resisting the urge to impulse buy anything) until my husband's prescription is ready. I pick up his along with a prescription for me ($52.40).  $89.24 11 a.m. \u2014 Home again! It's super cold and windy by North Carolina standards.

We come home and I run around doing housework and baby food prep while he naps. I also work on my son's baby book, selecting 100 or so pictures taken since Christmas, loading them onto the Shutterfly app, and ordering prints ($12.93).

The super-sweet manager hands my son a balloon as we're leaving, and he is beyond thrilled. By 5, my husband stops working and we open a bottle of wine while I start making baby food. I like for at least two of my son's three daily meals to be homemade. (They were all homemade until he developed a love of pouches while we were visiting his grandparents.) At 6:30, we turn on the game and I finish up our appetizers: Irish nachos and baked buffalo chicken nuggets.

I grab pretzels from my desk and a soda from the kitchen. Around 11:45, I'm back at the kitchen for the bistro box I bought last week. This one is grapes, apple, and Colby-Jack cheese. I get water as well since I've been drinking too much soda lately. 3 p.m. \u2014 I pry myself away from my desk and walk to the kitchen. I ponder buying a snack from the market in our office, but nothing sounds appealing.

One benefit is that I'm not late for work anymore! 8:45 a.m. \u2014 Still a few minutes to kill before I have to head into work, so I stop at Starbucks and get a tall sugar-free vanilla iced coffee and do a quick walk around Bryant Park before going to the office.  $3 9 a.m. \u2014 One enormous benefit of my job is that breakfast and lunch are provide. Since I am not a morning person or a very good cook, this has been an awesome perk. The downside is that I've already gained five pounds since I started working here six months ago; I'm trying to be better about snacking and piling on the meals. Start the day with a bowl of Raisin Bran. Advertisement 12:30 p.m. \u2014 Time for lunch (and feeling proud I made it through the morning without unnecessary snacking). Make my usual salad with tuna, carrots, broccoli, and olives, and snag a bowl of seafood paella from the hot food station. I consider the risk of eating mussels from a corporate cafeteria ... but it smells (and tastes!) delicious. End lunch with a packet of mini-M&Ms and dark chocolate. Free snacks are tempting! 3 p.m. \u2014 Getting the 3 p.m. slump, so I take a quick break and walk around Bryant Park. Not a fan of this office location as I have to walk through Times Square to get anywhere. Overall; it's a small thing to complain about. I love the work, the people, and the hours. Sigh. So much for \"fresh air,\" although I do feel better after moving around. 4:45 p.m. \u2014 Heading out of work early to get a manicure before I meet my boyfriend for date night. I used to work much longer hours, and I'm enjoying the flexibility of leaving at a normal time. Still, I feel guilty heading out before 5 and slink to the elevator bank, hopefully unnoticed. 5:30 p.m. \u2014 Time for my first (and only) manicure of 2017. I have a horrible nail biting habit but have managed to grow my nails out enough to warrant treating myself. The salon is completely empty and the manicurist finishes in 20 minutes. I kill time drying my nails for longer than necessary because I'm not meeting the BF until 7. Not something I would want to spend my time on every week, but my nails do look good.  $14 Advertisement 7 p.m. \u2014 Meet up with the BF outside of his office, and then take a nice walk through the Village. The weather is finally nice and the sun is out. We're attempting to get $20 tickets to see  Avenue Q  as part of a Broadway promotion I saw online. We take bets: I think we won't get them, he thinks we will. Fingers crossed! Since the show starts at 8 p.m. we don't have time for dinner beforehand; he buys a granola bar, and I snack on trail mix I took from work while we walk to the train. 7:45 p.m. \u2014 We got in! Great seats, and BF pays, since he still owes me $70 from a trip we took earlier this month. Apparently he's on an installment plan...  $20 10:30 p.m. \u2014 The show was hilarious! So happy we got to see it, and psyched we got the discount. We walk around Midtown and settle on a Japanese dive bar that serves katsudon. I order a rice bowl with salmon and crab, and we split sake. We split the bill and head back to Astoria to stay at my BF's place. Shockingly, the trains run smoothly, but it's a very late night. I'm dreading tomorrow's alarm.  $21 Daily Total: $58", "day_two": "Day Two: 7:30 a.m. \u2014 Arghhh. I begrudgingly get up, shower, and get out the door at 8. 8:45 a.m. \u2014 Falling into the Starbucks trap: sugar-free vanilla iced coffee. I justify it with my lack of spending on other meals (even though I know these coffees add up).  $3 Advertisement 9:15 a.m. \u2014 Feeling especially crummy today. I've been fighting a sinus infection or some other ailment for the last month, and I think it's time to go to the doctor. I have my own health insurance since I freelance, but the plan is terrible and nothing is covered \u2014 my excuse for letting things go this long. I book an appointment for tomorrow morning and grab a bowl of cereal and orange juice from the office kitchen. Maybe some vitamin C will cure me? 12:30 p.m. \u2014 Time for lunch. I get my usual salad from the office cafeteria and a cup of green tea. Hoping this is the magical elixir that will save me from tomorrow's doctor's appointment and the heavy price tag. 2:30 p.m. \u2014 Take my afternoon walk and stop by Duane Reade to pick up a generic sinus medication ($4.50). I also buy a coconut water ($2) since I think I might also be dehydrated and can't stand the taste of Gatorade. I take a sip of the coconut water and decide that Gatorade would have been preferable. Yuck!  $6.50 3:30 p.m. \u2014 Head to our weekly staff meeting, where my boss tells me I look like I've been punched in the face. He sends me home for the rest of the day. I feel too sickly to be offended. I go home and crawl straight into bed. 7 p.m. \u2014 My refrigerator is empty, save for a bag of carrots and salsa. I used to be much better about cooking, but now that I no longer have to worry about breakfast and lunch, I've fallen into the bad habit of buying dinner multiple times a week and scrounging for unsatisfying meals the rest of the time. I need to be better about this, but for now, carrots will do. My head is pounding, so I snack a little bit and and then hit the sack by 8:30.

I shoot my boss an email telling her I'll be working from home after I get back from my doctor's appointment. She works from home on Fridays, too, so my work guilt is at a minimum. 8:30 a.m. \u2014 The doctor doesn't open until 9 a.m., so I make a smoothie with frozen berries and the rest of the coconut water from yesterday. Hoping the fruit disguises the taste. The smoothie isn't bad and soothes my throat. I also make coffee and decide against showering. Fully embracing this sick day. 10 a.m. \u2014 I have strep throat! Semi-relieved to finally know what's been wrong with me for the past few weeks. This office doesn't take my insurance, but it's the closest to my apartment. The visit costs $125, and I wasn't charged anything extra, which is a relief. Because my insurance is so terrible, I was convinced the appointment would be $500, so I feel like I saved money. Mind over matter.  $125 11 a.m. \u2014 Wait over an hour for my prescription to get filled ($4.80), and grab a bag of cough drops that are on sale to see if they'll help my sore throat. I'm bummed about the turn of events for this weekend, and I call my mom to tell her I can't meet my family for dinner or the concert tonight. Looks like my busy weekend is going to turn into something much more low-key, but obviously I need to start listening to my body a little better. Back home to bed I go.  $6.50 Advertisement 1:30 p.m. \u2014 I work from home for about an hour, finishing up a project I need to send over to my boss. Once that's done, my boss tells me to get some rest. BF calls to see how I'm feeling, and we talk for a few minutes. It's gorgeous out and I could use the fresh air, but I burrow into my covers and try to get some sleep. 3 p.m. \u2014 So much for sleep. I'm already bored and antsy. Time for some self-soothing Amazon shopping. I impulse-buy a pair of black joggers I've been eyeing, two tubes of whitening toothpaste since I'm running low, and buy refrigerator poetry magnets as a gift for my boyfriend; he's mentioned wanting a set for his place. We'll be celebrating our six-month anniversary next month. Do couples give each other gifts for that?? If not, I'll put it aside for the holidays. The total comes to $35, but I have $34 in rewards points on my credit card. Since I don't really \"need\" any of these things, I use my points and the total comes to 84 cents! What a deal.  $0.84 5 p.m. \u2014 Scrounge together another pathetic dinner of jarred cabbage and scrambled eggs. Make a mental note to recipe hunt and start making some real food. I need to start treating my body better, as is evidenced by my current health. 9 p.m. \u2014 Head to bed feeling sufficiently bummed that I'm missing family night, but my throat is painfully sore and my head is pounding. Fingers crossed a long night's sleep will restore me and the antibiotics will eventually kick in.

Throat feels worse than yesterday, so I gargle with salt water, make a pot of coffee, and another smoothie with my frozen fruit and yogurt. Hydrating! My mom calls to see how I'm feeling, and we chat for a few minutes about the concert last night. As soon as I hang up with her, my sister calls. Lots of family catch-up time. 2 p.m. \u2014 Attempt to feel more human before I meet up with the BF. I feel better after a shower, and decide to walk the 50 or so blocks to his parents' apartment. I stop for more cough drops because the menthol ones I bought yesterday are too strong, and I can't stand the flavor. Trying cherry this time.  $2 5 p.m. \u2014 Spend an hour helping the BF self-address envelopes for co-op applications. Even though he's explained the process to me many times, it still sounds overly confusing. All I know is that if he successfully applies, he'll own an apartment in NYC for much, much less than if he buys it outright. He makes an offhand comment about us living there together someday; I don't know if it's just because I'm sick, but it throws me for an overwhelming loop. I laugh it off and make a mental note to bring this up when we're not sitting in his living room with his parents and sister. 6:30 p.m. \u2014 BF and I take his family dogs around Central Park for a walk. The fresh air feels good, but I'm especially quiet after the housing talk before. I love him, but we've been together for five months! It seems speedy, and I'm feeling caught off-guard. I make the mistake of bringing it up when we have a few blocks to go, which leads to an awkward conversation about \"our future.\" It's nice to hear he's so sure about this relationship and where it's going. I'm a much more tentative person and just don't feel ready to think about living together and planning a future. It's not exactly the way I saw this night going, and I suddenly regret leaving my bed! Advertisement 8:30 p.m. \u2014 After tabling our big talk until we can be alone, we go to a Puerto Rican family restaurant in the neighborhood. His sister joins, and I order chicken mofongo, which tastes amazing. Considering this is the first real meal I've eaten in two days, it's salty and so delicious. Steal a few bites of the BF's steak, and his sister offers her chicharrones around the table. Leave the restaurant stuffed, and BF pays for dinner since it's cash only. I'll get the next thing. 11:30 p.m. \u2014 Finally back in Queens after lots of subway delays. BF and I hang in his room and continue our (long) convo about where we are. He admits he's been feeling pressure from his family, and apologizes for rushing things along. We agree that the pace we're at is good for us, and the co-op discussion will get tabled for much farther down the line. Whew! This is my first real relationship, and I'm feeling emotionally exhausted from this talk. We watch Netflix but I fall asleep 10 minutes in.

We laze around chatting for a half-hour and decide to get brunch in Astoria. It's my turn to pick the place, so I search Google Maps for a spot I've passed on my walk to the subway. We can't find it and decide to just walk around and pick something. Advertisement 11:30 a.m. \u2014 We find the spot, and the brunch deal is great! It costs $14 for brunch with coffee and a drink; we're definitely not in Manhattan. We both order the same thing: omelets with cheddar and onions and arugula salad. BF orders a Bloody Mary, and I watch jealously as he drinks it. Since I'm on antibiotics, I stick to an iced cold brew which does wonders for my throat. We have the back patio completely to ourselves and enjoy the gorgeous weather. I pay for brunch since he got dinner. He leaves the tip ($6) in cash.  $30 2:30 a.m. \u2014 We decide to walk off our brunch with a trip on foot to Astoria Park. It is hot! Already sweating, and we're only halfway there. We finally get to the park, and BF treats me to an ice cream cone since he feels bad about drinking the Bloody Mary. I tell him to not feel guilty, but I still take the cone! We find a shady spot and people watch in the grass. I snooze for a bit, and then we brainstorm plans for the rest of the afternoon. 3:30 p.m. \u2014 After running through our apps and Googling various goings-on about town, we decide to walk to Manhattan from Queens. It seems like a good idea at the time. 5:30 p.m. \u2014 BF and I joke about the extreme things we will do to avoid using the MTA on the weekend. After walking over the Triborough Bridge, around Ward's Island, and over the pedestrian bridge into Manhattan, we make it! We stop at a bodega for two giant bottles of water and walk to Central Park to see the Conservatory Gardens.  $3 Advertisement 6 p.m. \u2014 The gardens are gorgeous, and I'm feeling a lot more upbeat after our long walk. We pick a park bench and watch a couple take engagement photos. The light is absolutely gorgeous, and it's so nice to be out in the sun the entire day! BF is in the mood to see a movie, but nothing good is playing, so we decide to \"treat ourselves\" and go to a comedy show. Downtown we go! 7 p.m. \u2014 We make it to the show after (more) subway delays. It's $10 apiece to see comedians try out new material. The BF pays, and it's surprisingly not as awkward as we anticipated. The headliner used to be on  The Daily Show  and does some hilarious bits. We head to Madison Square Park for dinner and basically attempt to reenact all of his jokes. 9:30 p.m. \u2014 The BF wants Shake Shack, but I'm not a fan, so I stop at a Mediterranean place and get a kale salad with falafel and roasted vegetables. BF changes his mind about Shake Shack and gets a wrap with meatballs and vegetables. I pay for dinner, and we walk to the park to sit outside.  $20 10:30 p.m. \u2014 BF is again tempted by our proximity to Shake Shack and considers buying a burger for the ride home. Considering the line is still so long at 10:30 at night, he decides against it, and we head to the R train to go back to Queens. Fingers crossed the train runs smoothly. Advertisement 11 p.m. \u2014 Shockingly, the train got us back to his apartment with no issues! My boyfriend's roommates give him some flack for not being home for a while, so we hang out with them so they can get in some \"bonding time.\" My BF has tomorrow off, but I have to go to work, so we get ready for bed.

Old habits die hard, but it's still hot out and the cold coffee helps soothe my sore throat. Still waiting for those antibiotics to kick in; I'm getting tired of feeling so crummy.  $3 9:15 a.m. \u2014 Slightly late to work, but I beat my boss in, so I'm safe. No one actually keeps track; I'm just stuck in the habit of being paranoid about working hours after working at much more intense jobs. I grab my usual bowl of Raisin Bran from the office kitchen, a glass of orange juice, and a cup of green tea. I will beat this strep! 12:30 p.m. \u2014 Fading fast after a busy morning catching up. I hope lunch, another coffee, and antibiotics will revive me. Make my salad since nothing else looks appetizing. I grab a bag of veggie chips from the snack area and work at my desk through lunch.

Grab a bottle of green tea and repurpose my Starbucks cup from this morning with fresh ice. I also add honey to help my throat, and grab a bag of edamame crisps to snack on. These things are addicting, although I can't decide if the flavor is all that pleasant. 5:15 p.m. \u2014 Leaving work. I have to go back to my apartment uptown before my band rehearsal tonight, since I stayed in Queens and didn't bring my instrument to work. I play in an adult wind ensemble, which is way cooler and more fun than it sounds. But the rehearsal is all the way in Brooklyn, and I live all the way uptown, so I cross my fingers for a speedy express A train. 5:45 p.m. \u2014 Home! I have 15 minutes before I need to head out again. I should straighten my apartment, but I instead lay on my bed and play Candy Crush for 20 minutes. Going to be late, but I make a berry and yogurt smoothie for the subway ride down. We usually go out for drinks after band practice, and I'll grab something else to eat post-rehearsal. 7:15 p.m. \u2014 Late for rehearsal. I clamor through 20 people to get to my seat in the middle of the stage; that never gets less embarrassing. It's such a stress reliever to play music for a few hours each week, and I've made some great friends! Once a band geek, always a band geek. Advertisement 9:30 p.m. \u2014 Decide to head to the bar after rehearsal with some of the guys in my instrument section. I get a water since I shouldn't drink while I'm on antibiotics. Decide against ordering food because the wait is usually long, and I don't want to stay out too late. Chat for a few and then head to the subway for the hour-long trek back home. 11 p.m. \u2014 Home at last! I find a fruit bar in my work bag and eat that even though I'm not hungry. I call my BF to catch up on our days, but he's half asleep and the conversation is lagging. We hang up and I get ready for bed.

I've never had one done, so I decide to treat myself. I'm usually pretty careful with these type of expenses since these coupon sites are like a black hole for me, but it's the end of the month, and I always get a little looser with the discretionary spending then.  $35 12:30 p.m. \u2014 Lunch time. Grab my usual salad, and a bowl of coconut soup with lemongrass and shrimp. It's delicious. Top it off with dark chocolate from the office kitchen and another cup of green tea. 3 p.m. \u2014 I mix up my walking route and decide to go around Hell's Kitchen. It's not relaxing because the traffic is horrible. Definitely not a fan of this office location, but I make a mental note to try a few of the restaurants around Ninth Avenue. There's great happy hour specials around here! 4 p.m. \u2014 The end-of-the-day slump is happening! Time for green tea, and a KIND bar from the office kitchen. I can't even tell if I'm hungry or just bored. It's been a long day. 5 p.m. \u2014 Head out at 5 on the dot and try to get myself amped to go for a run once I go home. My BF is eating dinner with his parents tonight, so I have some downtime before we meet up. I'm running a half-marathon next month, but since I've been under the weather, I am way behind on my training. Hopefully I can get at least five miles in tonight.

I  will  shop this weekend and get myself together! I decide to order sushi from a new place in my neighborhood that's part sushi restaurant, part hookah bar \u2014 but isn't very expensive. I order an eel roll and a spicy tuna on Seamless and hope for the best.  $13.50 9:15 p.m. \u2014 Sushi is good! I'll keep this place on my list.

My brother pays $850 per month for rent and splits the other costs with me evenly. I live in a three-bedroom apartment with my younger brother, who is an undergraduate student. Our sister (also an undergrad) comes in from Athens, GA, to visit almost every weekend, and my mom also comes to stay with us from Louisiana quite a bit. Because of this, my parents offered to pay the difference in cost between a two- and three-bedroom apartment. My mom transferred the money to me in one lump sum earlier this year, so although I pay more monthly than my brother does, we will have effectively paid the same amount over the course of our lease.

I was on a panel last night, and there's a LinkedIn request from one of my fellow panelists. I recently graduated from a master's program, and the career counselor of the program invited me to sit on a panel of alumni to talk about our careers. I was by far the youngest and least experienced person on the panel, and I think I offered a unique perspective to the current students as someone who was very recently in their shoes. 7:50 a.m. \u2014 After sending a few photos of our cat to my fianc\u00e9 who is currently out of town, I eat a breakfast of cereal and milk. I usually pack a lunch for work in the mornings, but my brother and I finished off the last of our leftovers last night, and we're running low on groceries. I plan to buy Subway for lunch; Subway texts me coupons every week, and more often than not, I end up using them. Advertisement 8:20 a.m. \u2014 I always listen to Audible on my morning commute, and David Sedaris'  Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim  is so funny that I don't want to get out of my car when I get to work. I eventually do go into the office and make myself coffee from the free Starbucks coffee machine in the break room. It's been really nice not having to spend so much money on K-Cups for my Keurig ever since I started working here. 9:30 a.m. \u2014 I catch up with a coworker who is getting married in three weeks. We both started at this company around the same time, and we both got engaged earlier this year. She's stressed about all the final preparations she needs to make for the wedding, but she's also getting really excited for the big day. Ever since I got engaged in June, I've been trying to extract advice from everyone I know who either recently got married or is getting married sometime soon. 11 a.m. \u2014 A vendor brings Waffle House catering to our office. This was a great day not to pack a lunch! The very friendly caterer makes me hash browns with cheese, ham, jalape\u00f1os, onions, and tomatoes. I also grab a waffle with butter and chocolate chips and a cup of Greek yogurt. I end up eating the yogurt and half of the waffle and hash browns during a meeting with two of my managers. 12:45 p.m. \u2014 Fianc\u00e9 is a fourth-year med student with almost $200,000 of student debt. When I got this job, we decided that I would take the money that I would have otherwise put towards retirement savings and instead use it to start paying off his loans. As a couple, we effectively combine our finances, and we decided it was better to pay off his loans sooner and start saving for retirement a little bit later. We decide to start paying off the highest-interest loans first, and I make the first payment at my desk between sips of orange juice that I got from the Waffle House catering. I meant to start these payments a while ago, but a combination of lack of information, wanting to build up my personal savings, and laziness meant that I'm just now making the first payment almost five months into my job.  $700 Advertisement 2 p.m. \u2014 Fianc\u00e9 texts me that a recent episode of John Oliver's show freaked him out about credit card security, and he wants to put a security freeze on my personal credit card information so no one else can use it. Basically, I have to pay money so that Equifax won't sell my information to anyone, and thus, hackers can't access it, or something like that. I tell him to go for it, and Venmo him the money. I make a mental note to watch that John Oliver segment later so I can actually understand what he's talking about, but in the meantime, I trust his judgment.  $13 3 p.m. \u2014 I get bored and hungry waiting on code to run, so I grab some snacks from the break room. We have a great selection of free snacks at my company, as well as a Coke Freestyle machine. Today, there's even a bowl of fruit sitting out. I get a small bowl of Chex Mix, a cup of Diet Coke, and an apple and head back to my desk. 6:45 p.m. \u2014 I had planned to go to the gym today, but I end up staying late at work and decide to just go straight home. 7:15 p.m. \u2014 I make a chicken and pasta dish from Blue Apron. I'm the chef of the household and usually cook for me and  my brother (and whoever else is around), but my brother has to stay late at school for a student government meeting, so tonight it's just me. When fianc\u00e9 is here, he pays for all groceries for our household, including the Blue Apron meals. He is essentially living with my brother and me part-time this year, since he has to go back and forth between Atlanta and New Orleans for his fourth-year med school rotations. Given his lack of income, the fact that he shares a room with me, and his part-time status, my brother and I agreed that we didn't need him to pitch in for rent or utilities, and that buying groceries would be an acceptable contribution. Even though he isn't in Atlanta this month, he still bought us Blue Apron meals that we could cook while he's away. Advertisement 8:45 p.m. \u2014 I clean the kitchen, then watch the new episode of  The Mindy Project . My brother texts me about potentially canceling our gym membership. He doesn't go often enough for it to be worth it, and I am perfectly content working out in our apartment building's fitness center. Fianc\u00e9 does really like going when he's here, though, so I suggest we discuss the matter when he gets to Atlanta later this week. 11 p.m. \u2014 I watch a few episodes of  Schitt's Creek  (such a good show), snuggle with my cat, and go to bed.

She immediately starts play-fighting with my cat, so I kick them both out and close the door. I'm able to get a little more sleep before my alarm goes off. 7 a.m. \u2014 Get up, get dressed, and have cereal and milk for breakfast again. I pack leftover chicken and pasta from last night for lunch, along with an apple. 8:20 a.m. \u2014 Get to work and make myself a coffee. A new guy just started working here this week, so I spend a few minutes chatting with him. He seems to like working here so far. 12 p.m. \u2014 I have a busy and productive morning at work, and one of my coworkers invites me to join a group going out to lunch. Although I packed a lunch today, I accept the invite. Since I'm still relatively new here, I take every opportunity to socialize with and get to know my coworkers, both during and outside of work. I'll just leave my packed lunch in the office fridge and eat it tomorrow. We go to an authentic Italian deli, and I get a prosciutto and mozzarella sandwich, a lemon anginetti, and a cup of water.  $9.36 Advertisement 1:10 p.m. \u2014 Oh no! When I agreed to go out to lunch, I completely forgot I had a 1:00 meeting, and I don't realize my mistake until after the meeting has already started. I rush back to the office and sneak in about 10 minutes late. 5:45 p.m. \u2014 Tomorrow is my coworker's last day at the company, so a bunch of us leave work a little early to go to a pub for a going-away party. I end up having a really nice time, and I'm one of the last people to leave around 8:45 p.m. I get a glass of cider, a bourbon-based mixed drink, a grilled cheese, and a cup of tomato soup. I box up half the grilled cheese to take home for a lunch this week. One of our managers sneakily pays for the first round of drinks before he leaves, so I don't have to pay for the cider. I tip 20%, as always.  $21.42 9:15 p.m. \u2014 I get home and straighten up my apartment a bit in preparation for my mom coming to visit tomorrow. I notice my brother has done the dishes, and I tell him that I appreciate it. In our household, I do all the cooking, and he does all the dishes. When fianc\u00e9 is here, he does all the other kitchen cleaning (mostly wiping down counter tops and cleaning the floor). When he's not here, my brother and I split those tasks. 10 p.m. \u2014 Two of my friends separately text me inviting me to a Shabbat picnic-in-the-park event they're going to on Friday. The three of us are basically the only young Jews we know in Atlanta (besides my brother), so we try to do the occasional Jewish event together. Fianc\u00e9 is coming back to Atlanta Friday afternoon, and even though he isn't Jewish, he says he'd be interested in the event as well. I get us both tickets, which include a meal and a drink each.  $10 Advertisement 11:15 p.m. \u2014 I watch an episode of  Schitt's Creek  and an episode of  Brooklyn Nine-Nine , then I hit the hay. Daily Total: $40.78", "day_three": "Day Three: 5:45 a.m. \u2014 My cat wakes up and starts meowing, scratching himself, eating from his food bowl, and generally making a racket. I try to block out the sounds, but I get barely any sleep before my alarm is supposed to go off. 7:15 a.m. \u2014 My alarm did not go off for some reason, but thanks to my cat, I'm awake anyway. Of course, now that it's time for me to get up, he's sitting sweetly and peacefully on the bed, not making a sound. Where was this behavior an hour ago? 8 a.m. \u2014 Cereal and milk again for breakfast. 8:40 a.m. \u2014 Get to work and make myself some coffee. 11 a.m. \u2014 Get a Snapchat from my brother showing that my mom has arrived safely. They are apparently at my mom's favorite brunch spot to visit when she's in town. Feeling a little FOMO. 11:30 a.m. \u2014 Had another busy morning and decide to eat an early lunch, so I heat up the chicken and pasta that I left in the fridge yesterday. I also rinse the apple I brought and get some ice water from the water machine in the break room. While eating, I call my insurance company to cancel a claim I filed last week. I was rear-ended on my way home from work, and I heard from the other lady's insurance company that they are (rightfully) accepting full liability for the accident. It's such a pain to deal with this, and such a bummer it happened to my new car. But no one was hurt, and the damage wasn't too bad \u2014 it could have been much worse. Plus, my amazingly helpful mother has agreed to take my car in to the shop to get an estimate for the damages tomorrow while I'm at work. One of my coworkers has agreed to drive me, so it all works out really well. Advertisement 12:15 p.m. \u2014 Back to work. My to-do list just keeps growing. 4 p.m. \u2014 I finally come up for air after staring at my computer for basically four hours straight. While I wait for some code to run, I check my phone, grab some Cheez-It's and Peanut M&M's from the break room, and refill my cup of water. I really should remember to bring a thermos to work; I use one disposable cup each on coffee and water or soda every day. They're free, but I know it's wasteful. 4:40 p.m. \u2014 My manager schedules a meeting that's supposed to end at 6:30 p.m. I have plans tonight with a friend downtown, which can be an hour-and-a-half drive or longer to get to from my work during rush hour. (My office is in a small city just outside of Atlanta.) I text her saying I'm not sure what to do; we're supposed to see a show, and they say they will lock the doors promptly at 8. It's not a huge deal if I miss the show (it only cost $5), but I don't want to let her down. She says it's not a big deal, and she can find someone else to go with her. She Venmos me back the $5 she used to buy my ticket. We're seeing each other tomorrow at the Shabbat event anyway, so I don't worry too much about it. 6:45 p.m. \u2014 I'm finally leaving work, and my mom texts to say she'll pay for take-out if I'll pick it up on the way home. My brother and I each get a fried chicken sandwich with a side of grits and green beans; my mom gets a salmon salad. She also wants me to pick up some Coke Zeros on the way home. I use the credit card I have that's linked to my parents' account to pay for everything. I've had this credit card probably since middle school, and I only ever use it if my parents want me to buy something on their behalf. Advertisement 9:15 p.m. \u2014 I work on some crosswords from a book of  New York Times  crossword puzzles in my living room while my brother studies for an exam and my mom works on her computer. The cats chase each other around the apartment. 11 p.m. \u2014 I watch the new  Black-ish  and  Fresh Off the Boat , text my friends to confirm plans for tomorrow, snuggle with my cat, and go to sleep. Daily Total: $0", "day_four": "Day Four: 6:35 a.m. \u2014 I wake up early. Instead of going to the office today, a group of around 20 women from my company are attending a conference about women in leadership. I do my hair and makeup and pick out a business formal outfit. My office has a semi-casual dress code, so it's kinda fun to get dressed up every once in a while (but I'm definitely glad it's not every day). I wear a dress, a black blazer, black tights, and Spanx underneath. The founder of Spanx, Sara Blakely, will actually be speaking at the conference today! 7:25 a.m. \u2014 My coworker picks me up since my mom is taking my car into the shop today. On the way, she suggests we stop by Dunkin' Donuts. I agree and insist I pay for both of us to thank her for driving me. We each get a small coffee, and we share a bagel with cream cheese.  $6.17 8 a.m. \u2014 We get to the hotel where the conference is hosted, and it turns out there is breakfast provided. We probably shouldn't have stopped at Dunkin' after all; oh well. I drop my business card in the raffle bowl and head to my seat right as the conference begins. There is a swag bag at every seat, which contains some freebies including a lip balm, a key chain, and a notebook. Advertisement 10 a.m. \u2014 Fianc\u00e9 texts that he's leaving New Orleans; he'll arrive in Atlanta around 6 p.m. tonight! 10:45 a.m. \u2014 My mom texts from the collision center where she took my car. Apparently, the damage is worse than I thought, and the mechanic has deemed my car \"not fit to drive.\" The repairs will take about two weeks, and in the meantime, I'll drive a rental car. So frustrating! Thank god the other lady's insurance is covering all this, and thank god I have such an amazing mother who is willing to take several hours out of her day to help me with this problem. 12 p.m. \u2014 We have a 15-minute break before lunch is served. I chat with my coworkers and grab a free Diet Coke. 12:15 p.m. \u2014 Lunch is delicious. I have a salad with goat cheese and candied pecans, a pretzel roll with butter, roasted chicken with butternut squash risotto, a pumpkin spice macaron, and a vanilla cake pop. 1:15 p.m. \u2014 It's the moment we've all been waiting for: Sara Blakely's keynote speech. She is interviewed fireside-chat style by her childhood friend Chevy Arnold. Her story is really interesting: She actually founded Spanx in Virginia Highlands, a neighborhood here in Atlanta, with $5,000 that she saved selling fax machines door-to-door in Florida for seven years. Now, 17 years later, she was just named one of  Forbes ' 100 Greatest Living Business Minds and is the sole owner of the billion-dollar company. Near the end of her speech, she announces that she is giving each conference attendee a free pair of Spanx's newest product, Arm Tights! Honestly, they seem a little silly, but I'm definitely excited to give them a try. Advertisement 2:30 p.m. \u2014 To wrap up the conference, they announce the raffle winners. Some of the prizes include a Kendra Scott bracelet, a $50 meal delivery gift card, a one-night stay in a luxury hotel, and $100 Spanx gift card. I win one of the raffle drawings, but my prize is a book about leadership by a local author. It's cool that I won something, but I honestly don't really read hard copies of books these days \u2014 it's all about Audible for me. I can't help but envy the other raffle winners a little. 2:45 p.m. \u2014 The conference ends, and the group of women from my company go to the hotel bar for a company-sponsored happy hour. I order a $17 vodka-and-sparkling-ros\u00e9 cocktail (it's  so  good). One of the managers pays for everyone; she'll expense it later. 3:45 p.m. \u2014 People start getting up to leave. The coworker who drove me pays $17 for valet parking; she'll expense it later. I get home, catch up with my mom, shower, blow dry my hair, put on some makeup, and get dressed. I have the Shabbat event tonight, and afterwards I'm going out to a bar with some friends from my master's program. 6:15 p.m. \u2014 Fianc\u00e9 gets here from New Orleans! I'm so excited to see him. He quickly changes clothes. He's happy to go out with me tonight, but I can tell he's kind of tired from the drive. I have a feeling tonight might be an early night. Advertisement 6:45 p.m. \u2014 We get to the MARTA station, and I realize I forgot my Breeze card. Instead of buying another one, I just sneak in right behind Fianc\u00e9. I know it's illegal, and I don't like sneaking in, but we're already running pretty late for the Shabbat event, so I do it. 7:15 p.m. \u2014 We arrive at the park and collect our food and drink tickets. The food ticket includes an entree and two sides from the food truck, and the drink ticket includes a beer or wine from the bar. Fianc\u00e9 gets a waffle cone filled with curry chicken and sides of vegan sausage with sweet potatoes and a flatbread with goat cheese and mint spread. I get a Parmesan waffle cone filled with lentils and two sides of the flatbread. He gets a beer from the bar, and I get a glass of white wine. One of my friends is already here; the other one is still at work, and probably won't be able to make it. 8:45 p.m. \u2014 The event is really lovely. When it's wrapping up, we say goodbye to my friend and walk over to another friend's apartment to meet up with the group that's going to the bar. The six of us take a Lyft Plus to the bar; I pay and tip $1.  $16 9:30 p.m. \u2014 Fianc\u00e9 and I play a game of darts against two of my friends. One of the guys from my master's program gets the first round of drinks; I have a sangria. Advertisement 10:15 p.m. \u2014 The friend who didn't make it to the Shabbat event earlier buys the second round of drinks; I have another sangria. Fianc\u00e9 and I win the darts game! 11 p.m. \u2014 Another guy friend gets the third round; I have a cider. Several more of our friends show up. 11:30 p.m. \u2014 The group decides to go to another bar to go dancing. Fianc\u00e9 is worn out and wants to leave. I do want to stay and dance with my friends, but I haven't seen fianc\u00e9 in a few weeks. Plus, I definitely know what it's like to want to leave a social situation, especially when the people aren't your own friend group. I call a Lyft Line; we don't pick up any other passengers, and we get a cheaper ride home! I pay. Once we get home, we go straight to bed.  $10 Daily Total: $32.17", "day_five": "Day Five: 8:45 a.m. \u2014 Wake up, and fianc\u00e9 is still asleep. This is pretty unusual \u2014 I almost always sleep later than he does. I lie in bed and scroll through my phone until he wakes up. Once he does, we stay in bed to talk and snuggle for a while. 10:20 a.m. \u2014 We finally get out of bed. While he goes down to the package center to pick up a package, I make us each a mug of coffee and an English muffin with cheese and a fried egg. Today, I'm meeting with five of my grad school friends to work on a project that we started during school. Even though we're done with our master's degree, we've decided to keep working on one of our class projects with the goal of turning it into a real business. This is the first time all six of us will be meeting together in person since school ended. Fianc\u00e9 and I scarf down our breakfast and leave to pick up one of my friends on the way to meeting the rest of the group. Advertisement 11:30 a.m. \u2014 We arrive at a coffee shop, and I buy a coffee for fianc\u00e9 and tea for me. I pay and tip. One of the other group members arrives.  $7 12:30 p.m. \u2014 The three remaining members of the group finally show up an hour late. This is pretty typical \u2014 none of us are really known for being on time to social or school-related events. Two of them are extremely hungover from last night. I guess it's good fianc\u00e9 and I left early! 1:15 p.m. \u2014 The friend who didn't make it to the Shabbat event last night throws up outside the restroom. I ask an employee if I can borrow a mop, but he says he'll clean it up. Sick Friend is feeling too nauseous to eat the bagel and cream cheese she bought, so she gives it to me. 2 p.m. \u2014 The wifi at the coffee shop keeps going out, so we decide to go Sick Friend's apartment and work in her building's study lounge. Fianc\u00e9 drives me, the friend we picked up earlier, and Sick Friend in my car. She gets sick again on the drive, and I quickly hand her an empty tissue box to throw up in. Luckily, it's her apartment that we're going to, so she can shower when we get there. We park in a metered spot on a nearby street; I pay $8 for four hours of parking, but the friend we picked up earlier slips me a $10 bill. Advertisement 4 p.m. \u2014 We make good progress on our project. I work on designing a logo. Sick Friend orders pizza for everyone, and I Venmo her $5. Fianc\u00e9 and I each eat one slice. Fianc\u00e9 goes to work out in the apartment's fitness center.  $5 6 p.m. \u2014 We leave and drop my friend back off. On the way back to my apartment, we take the car through a car wash ($5). I borrowed my brother's car today, and I spilled some coffee on the car when I tried to dump it out the window earlier. We also stop for groceries and get lettuce, yogurt, eggs, champagne (for making French 75s with the gin I brought fianc\u00e9 from London a few months ago), lemons, VitaminWater, angel hair pasta, two black and white cookies and some sliced Italian bread from the bakery, chicken breasts, arugula, a rotisserie chicken, apples, bananas, cream, milk, Caesar dressing, cereal, and some cases of Coke (Sprite Zero, Diet Coke, and Coke Zero Sugar). The total comes out to $127. Fianc\u00e9 pays.  $5 7:30 p.m. \u2014 My mom and brother help us get the groceries in from the car. I make chicken pasta and an arugula salad with lemon, olive oil, and Parmesan. Fianc\u00e9 tries arugula for the first time tonight and is not a fan. 9 p.m. \u2014 Fianc\u00e9 and I do a  New York Times  crossword puzzle, watch an episode of  Desus & Mero  and  Curb Your Enthusiasm . 11:50 p.m. \u2014 I notice the cat is almost out of food, so I order some more on Amazon ($18). I'll Venmo request fianc\u00e9 for half the cost. Although we rarely pay each other back for things we spend money on, we always split pet expenses evenly for some reason. I also get a Spider-Man costume for fianc\u00e9 as a gift ($39). It says the costume might not arrive in time for Halloween weekend, but expedited shipping is $40, so I decide to cross my fingers and risk it.  $57 Advertisement Daily Total: $74", "day_six": "Day Six: 5:30 a.m. \u2014 Cat meows all morning.

He went back to the store to pick up bacon and paper towels, and he is now studying for his big exam tomorrow. 10:15 a.m. \u2014 I put away some clean dishes from the dishwasher, and my mom starts doing the dishes. She says we're down to our last dishwasher detergent pod. Dang it! I wish we had known that before we went to the store. I make myself some coffee and put away some laundry. 10:45 a.m. \u2014 Fianc\u00e9's exam tomorrow is an eight-hour test of his skills interviewing patients. He'll have to do 12 mock interviews with actors pretending to be sick patients. Today, I help him practice for the exam by acting like a patient. In the first case we do, I'm a 25-year-old man who was recently in a car accident. In the second case, I'm a 28-year-old woman who has an unplanned pregnancy. He is pretty nervous and stressed, but I actually have a lot of fun acting sick and pregnant. 1 p.m. \u2014 Fianc\u00e9 unwinds by watching some football. My mom and I make what my family has always called \"big breakfast,\" which is basically just any breakfast-type meal that includes eggs and either bacon or sausage. We make fried eggs, bacon, arugula salad, and toast and English muffins with melted cheese. I drink a glass of the iced tea my brother made a few days ago and have a small bite of a black and white cookie. My brother is currently out for a school event, so he misses big breakfast. 1:45 p.m. \u2014 I watch  This Is Us  while Fianc\u00e9 watches football and my mom watches  Mindhunter . My friend texts me and asks to stay at my place tonight and ride with me to work in the morning; he's in town from Orlando for several interviews this weekend, including one at my company. I agree but warn him he'll be on the futon in the living room tonight, since my mom is visiting and occupying the guest room. 2:30 p.m. \u2014 I do another practice case with fianc\u00e9 during halftime. Then I watch another episode of  This Is Us  and the newest episode of  The Good Place . 6:30 p.m. \u2014 Fianc\u00e9 heats up leftover chicken pasta, and I make a salad with romaine and an olive oil-based dressing. My brother gets home from his school thing, but he's already had dinner. My mom, fianc\u00e9, and I eat dinner and each have a glass of the ros\u00e9 that I picked up from Fresh Market when they were having a wine sale last week. 7:30 p.m. \u2014 My coworker has a friend who is a fashion designer and a seamstress, and I reached out to her a while ago asking if she'd be interested in collaborating with me on a custom wedding dress for my upcoming wedding. I finally hear back from her, and she is really excited to work with me. I hope to use just the bodice of my mom's wedding dress (with her enthusiastic blessing) and create a custom skirt to go with it. I'm so excited to get started! 8:30 p.m. \u2014 Do a couple more practice cases with fianc\u00e9.

One coworker pays for all four of us; she'll expense it later. I save half the wrap and olives for lunch tomorrow. 1:30 p.m. \u2014 A few male coworkers, including a manager, gang up on me to argue that we don't need feminism because women in America already have it way better than other places. I did not bring up this topic, nor do I engage in the conversation, but they say things like \"Look, we're making her mad,\" and \"You should tell her that joke about feminism that you told me earlier.\" I feel extremely uncomfortable and pretty upset. In most spheres of my life, I have no problem getting into a passionate debate about feminism, but I'm not sure how to handle this sort of thing in the workplace. 6 p.m. \u2014 Still feeling pretty bummed about earlier when I leave work.

A famous New Orleans chef has been accused of sexual harassment. NYPD officers allegedly raped a teenager. A foster care company is under investigation for the unexpected deaths of almost 100 children in its care. There is just so much pain and suffering in the world. 8 p.m. \u2014 I'm still feeling down in the dumps, so my mom orders some pizza, my ultimate comfort food. We get pepperoni pizza with mushrooms (on her half) and onions (on my half), cheesy bread, garlic knots, and chicken tenders. She pays. With my pizza, I have a Sprite Zero and another glass of the ros\u00e9. Neither my brother nor Fianc\u00e9 are home yet, but they'll definitely enjoy the pizza leftovers tonight or tomorrow.

I'm out the door by 8:45. 9:30 a.m. \u2014 I get into the office and fill up my water bottle. I work in advertising, and we have a new-ish client who is super demanding.

I purchase a week's worth of groceries, including chicken breasts, salad mix, salmon, fruits, and assorted vegetables.  $209.67 3:15 p.m. \u2014 My phone goes off just as I get home and start unloading groceries. One of my regulars is at the ranch looking to visit with me.

We exchange a hug and a kiss, then head back to my room to negotiate. We decide to go with our usual \u2014 the GFE or Girlfriend Experience \u2014 with a few new positions. J. uses Viagra, so we return to the bar to have a drink and catch up while we wait for it to kick in. Advertisement 5 p.m. \u2014 We head to the office to book our date.  Amount Booked:  $2,000.

I eat in front of my computer while I respond to email inquiries. 8:15 p.m. \u2014 Evening walk with the dogs. 9 p.m. \u2014 Netflix and tea. I\u2019m catching up on  Stranger Things  in anticipation of the next season!

I check my emails while eating breakfast. 10:17 a.m. \u2014 The bell rings. Company! We all run out of our rooms and down the hallways to the front parlor, where we stand in a line and introduce ourselves to the gentleman that has just walked in. This is called a lineup. The gentleman walks up to the lady of his choice, takes her by the hand, and they then \"go on tour.\" Since I am the one chosen, I take him around the back of the property and show off some of our bungalows and suites. The ranch is much larger than it looks from the front, so people are often surprised by the size of the facility! We wrap up the tour and head back to my suite to negotiate. 10:36 a.m. \u2014 We settle on $1,000 for our encounter, and head to the office to book the party. Here at the ranch, rather than \"having sex,\" we say we are \"having a party.\" It\u2019s a term that's unique to the industry, but one I\u2019m rather fond of. When we book a party at the ranch, I take the guest to the \"Hooker Booker\" office where the transaction takes place. The cashier handles the financial information \u2014 rather than the ladies \u2014 to protect our guests' information.  Amount Booked:  $1,000.

If she comes back positive for anything, the girl is unable to work. The doctor cost is $75/week, and once per month we have to do blood work, which brings the cost up to $110. This is a normal exam week for me. This expense must be paid by the working ladies, and isn't covered by insurance.  $75 3:05 p.m. \u2014 Lineup, and once again I am picked. We go on tour, and negotiate a simple massage party.  I\u2019m a trained massage therapist, so this is a frequent request.  Amount Booked:  $500.  Amount Earned:  $250. 4:10 p.m. \u2014 I break for lunch. Part of our room and board cost includes food and use of the kitchen. We get a hot meal daily, plus access to fruits, veggies, eggs, and leftovers, 24/7. I\u2019ll tell you something \u2014 sex workers sure can eat. We certainly aren\u2019t starving ourselves here! We have hot dogs, hamburgers, ribs, pulled pork, steamed veggies, and cake for dessert. I happily indulge. 9 p.m. \u2014 My shift is over, and I pack up and head home for the day. 9:35 p.m. \u2014 It\u2019s late and I'm already tired.

This is a couple from out of town that came by to tour the place. They don't seem interested in sex, so I focus on giving them a great tour of the property. We get visitors throughout the week who come by to see the place and are more interested in what we do here. They tip me $20 for my time.  Amount Booked:  $20.

Each week, the ladies of the Bunny Ranch have a meeting with the staff to go over that week's performance, upcoming events, notes of interests, and more. I leave my room and take a seat in the parlor. 3 p.m. \u2014 Tea Party is supposed to start. We\u2019re operating on S.S.T (Sex-worker Standard Time) so Tea Party actually begins a bit later at 3:10. This week, I am \"Bunny of the Week\" and receive a box of soap and bath accessories as my reward. 4:05 p.m. \u2014 Tea Party ends, and it\u2019s back to the computer.

I\u2019m picked, and excuse myself for a moment to move my food to the fridge before heading back for a tour. We negotiate and settle on $2,200 for a romantic GFE encounter. GFE, or the Girlfriend Experience is my specialty. During a GFE party, there is an element of romance and connection with the other person. Lots of kissing and cuddling \u2014 think of honeymoon sex. Very lovey dovey, just the way I like it.  Amount Booked:  $2,200.  Amount Earned:  $1,100 8:09 p.m. \u2014 I spend the last hour of my shift showing one of the new girls how to set up her Twitter account. Social media is very important for us, as we can\u2019t advertise in the traditional way. That online exposure can make or break your business. 9 p.m. \u2014 I head home from my shift. I needed a pet sitter today, so it was another $15.  $15 9:35 p.m. \u2014 I arrive home and begin the nightly ritual of dinner, animal care, etc. I head to bed around 11 p.m. Daily Total Spent: $22.89 Daily Total Earned: $1,110", "day_five": "Day Five: 6:17 a.m. \u2014 I\u2019m up extra early today, as I want to get to work early and spend time with my pony, Merlin.

This guy\u2019s earning some serious brownie points for his awesome Deadpool t-shirt. A common misconception is that the ranch is very formal \u2014 quite the opposite is true! You dress however you feel most comfortable, from jeans and a t-shirt to a suit. I\u2019m wearing a simple fall dress, since we discussed potentially going out together as part of our date. We negotiate, and he decides to join me, not just for dinner and a date, but also for the night! On average, I do one to two overnights each month.  Amount Booked:  $15,000.

We go for a walk in nearby Virginia City, then back to the ranch for intimate time together before dinner at Duke's. On an outdate, the client typically covers any activities that we do, so he pays this time. I'll sometimes treat my regulars to a meal or buy us surprise show tickets, etc. This isn't standard for all the sex workers, but it's something that I choose to do to show my appreciation.

The surgeon recommended that I not work for three to four weeks, so there go my big appointments. While I'm recovering from surgery, we arrange for another lady use my room at the Ranch, so I won't pay the room and board fees. At this point, I'm almost fully recovered from surgery, and can function well on my own. I\u2019m catching up on emails and rescheduling appointments that I'll miss due to my appendicitis. I also receive the first of many medical bills from my hospital stay; one from radiology for the pre-surgery scan of my appendix is $3,567.45. Advertisement As an independent contractor, I do not have an insurance plan through my job. Instead, I would have had to obtain insurance at the beginning of the year. Unfortunately, these policies do not cover multiple states, and I was still living part-time in the Midwest at the beginning of the year. (The reason why I opted out of insurance.) Before being discharged, I spoke with a woman from accounting who estimated that my out-of-pocket burden will range from $16,000 to $35,000. I am also losing three or four more weeks of income, which is typically about $20,000 to $30,000. I\u2019ll have to live off my savings for a while and arrange a payment plan with the hospital. I had two clients coming in from out of state, so I also have to purchase plane tickets for those rescheduled appointments. The medical emergency was on my side and the previous flight reservations weren't refundable, so I went ahead and covered the cost of their tickets. Financially, the impact of this surgery is huge.

Not hungry enough for breakfast (I had a big dinner the night before), so I skip it. I'm participating in National Novel Writing Month (NaNoWriMo), so I peck at the keyboard until it's time to get ready to leave. 9 a.m. \u2014 Hit the road for my 11 a.m. appointment. I'm having top surgery (bilateral mastectomy) done in a week, so I'm going to the surgeon's office for a pre-operation appointment. Fortunately, I was able to find a surgeon fairly close by in Gainesville, which is about a one-and-a-half-hour drive from Jacksonville. I filled up my gas tank a couple days ago, so I'm set to go. 12 p.m. \u2014 When I leave the surgeon's office, I have to pay for my upcoming surgery upfront. Last year, during the Obama administration, my health insurance would've covered 80% of the cost. However, my policy changed with the  shift in the political climate . Now there is no coverage. I could fight the decision, but that would likely mean a legal battle that'll cost me more than the surgery. In short, Jeff Sessions owes me roughly $4,500. I'm bitter. Since I'm paying out of pocket, the surgery costs $5,700. I transfer the money from my savings account to my checking account at the surgeon's office. I've been saving this money for about three years \u2014 most of it in 2014 and 2015, when I was still living at home. I have to call the bank and go through a security check to prove I'm not committing fraud, but finally the transaction goes through.  $5,700 Advertisement 2 p.m. \u2014 I drive back home to Jacksonville and eat lunch at my apartment. It's leftover chicken ravioli that I made two nights ago and my last clementine. I need to go grocery shopping soon. 4 p.m. \u2014 I'm supposed to meet my editing partner at a fast-casual restaurant at 6 p.m. I head there two hours early to look over the piece I'm editing for her and get more NaNoWriMo-ing done. You can't squat without food in front of you, so I order an early dinner: a cup of turkey chili and half of a turkey sandwich. 'Tis the season. It comes to $12.44 with a tip.  $12.44 6 p.m. \u2014 My editing partner arrives on time; they just order a chai latte. I always feel weird not eating when other people are, so I order one, too. We review each other's chapters and it's pretty productive, but it's also daunting to think about just how much I want to fix in my story. Shop talk somehow delves into a vent session about our childhood/current family relationships/mental illnesses. We wind up talking until it's nearly time for the restaurant to close. This is also productive.  $3.99 11 p.m. \u2014 Facebook knows me too well! I get a Facebook ad saying that tickets for  The Lion King  musical are finally on sale for my city. I've been wanting to see it for ages and it will be in town around my birthday. I buy a ticket right away because I know the good seats will be snapped up quickly.

Goals for today are to get some cleaning done, get some NaNoWriMo writing done, and go see a movie in the afternoon. I get distracted from cleaning, but my writing is going pretty decently. It's only Day 4 of NaNoWriMo and I am very behind. 1 p.m. \u2014 When I manage to make it to 3,350 words, I reward myself with pumpkin pie flavored ice cream I made for a Halloween get-together last week. It was a huge batch, so there's still plenty left. 3 p.m. \u2014 I go to a small, local theater to catch a French movie while it is in town for just a few days. I'm not a student, but the woman at the cashier gives me the student discount anyway, so ticket is $8. Huzzah! The movie theater also sells food, so I buy a hot dog and fries for $12. The hot dog is a lot better than I was expecting.  $20 6 p.m. \u2014 I get back home from the movie. I was tempted to buy a cupcake from the bakery next door to the movie theater, but I guilted myself out of it by thinking of all the ice cream I still have in my freezer that needs to be eaten. I eat a little bit of my ice cream while I try to amp myself up for more writing. Today is my first truly productive day for NaNoWriMo. Something about writing makes me hungry though, so around 10 p.m., I start digging around for food. Nothing in the kitchen looks remotely worth eating \u2026 except my roommate's frozen chicken tenders. The bag has been open in the freezer for several weeks, so I don't think he will miss a few of them. I would ask, but he's at work and generally doesn't respond to texts quickly when working.

Since I'm not being productive anyway, I decide it's time to run my errands. First stop is pharmacy to drop off my prescriptions. I'm about to run out of testosterone and my surgeon's office gave me a painkiller prescription to fill for recovery. Next, I run across the street for my groceries. I want to keep my meals this week simple because I will be busy with NaNoWriMo. Also, I don't really need a lot of food since I will only be at my apartment until Wednesday evening. I buy: a rotisserie chicken, a bag of apples, baby carrots, a green bell pepper, sweet potatoes, green beans, hummus, three cups of Greek yogurt, a box of protein bars, a block of cheddar cheese, a small box of fancy cookies, a tin of mints, and replacement frozen chicken tenders for my roommate. More than enough for three days of breakfast, lunch, and dinner, as well as some snacks.  $37.99 12:40 p.m. \u2014 As I'm driving home from the grocery store, the pharmacy calls to say both my prescriptions are ready.

I do meal prep for the next three days instead. I shred up the rotisserie chicken so that I can easily divide it up for meals. I bake and then mash the sweet potatoes. I cut up the green beans and steam them. I sort of nibble on everything a bit while I work, so it ends up being my lunch. While I work, I listen to video essays on YouTube about different films. Hopefully, it'll get my creative juices flowing. 4 p.m. \u2014 After puttering around some more and still not getting any writing done, I decide it's laundry time. My apartment doesn't have a laundry machine and I hate going to the laundromat, so every weekend I drive 20 minutes across town to my parents' house to use their washer and dryer. This also gives me an opportunity to pet their cat and, of course, visit with them. 6 p.m. \u2014 My dad wants to go out to eat, so we all three go to an inexpensive chain restaurant. I'm in a rare mood for red meat, so I order Salisbury steak, mashed potatoes, and mac and cheese. He never lets me pay for my meals when we go out. 9 p.m. \u2014 Get home with my laundry, and I've only written 500 words so far today. Whoops. I procrastinate a while longer to make myself a small fruit and veggie plate to snack on while I write, then I get to work. By the time I go to bed, I manage to make it to just over 6,000 words total, which isn't horrible. Advertisement Daily Total: $45.99", "day_four": "Day Four: 7:30 a.m. \u2014 Monday. My alarm goes off at 6 a.m., but I fall back asleep and don't manage to drag myself out of bed until 7:30. Just when I am planning to claim the bathroom, my roommate snags it. I pack up my lunch and snacks for the day while I wait for my turn. Breakfast is just a protein bar; I'll eat a Greek yogurt cup and an apple later at work too. I try to do a little bit of NaNoWriMo-ing, but my brain isn't in gear yet. 9 a.m. \u2014 I have an appointment with my therapist before work today. When I started transitioning medically, I needed to get a referral letter from a therapist, so I found a trans-friendly one and got the letter after two meetings. I continue to see him monthly because I find it helpful to vent to a neutral party. Today's session is mostly me complaining about my mom's constant fretting over me getting surgery. She is hoping that I will change my mind. I understand her concerns and have done my best to listen to them patiently, but it has been wearing on my nerves because it seems like she doesn't listen to me in turn. My therapist commiserates with me and I feel a lot better when I'm done venting. He isn't in-network, so I pay for all my appointments out of pocket. Fortunately, he operates on sliding scale, pay-what-you-can model, so it is only $60 for the hour.  $60 Advertisement 10:30 a.m. \u2014 Finally make it into work. It's gonna be a long day. I eat my yogurt and apple to fuel up. I'm a copywriter for a large company that does web hosting, site building, marketing, and related services for everything from small businesses to international, industrial giants. My job is to write the copy that appears on their sites. 1 p.m. \u2014 Suddenly I am starving? I haven't been at work for very long, but I take my lunch break anyway because I'm too focused on my hunger to focus on work. I eat my packed lunch: the chicken, sweet potatoes, and green beans that I prepared on Sunday. I'm still hungry and it's gonna be a long day, so I buy a small cup of soup from the kiosk in my building's cafeteria.  $2 3 p.m. \u2014 I get a text from Amazon saying that a book I pre-ordered a few weeks ago has shipped. It cost $11.56. Around 5 p.m., I get hungry again. I eat my remaining apple, as well the carrots and hummus that I packed.  $11.56 7 p.m. \u2014 Finally free. I drive home. There's no traffic, so I kinda zone out and think about my NaNoWriMo project. I have a breakthrough for a scene, so when I get home I immediately open my laptop and type it all out. Dinnertime. I eat the chicken, sweet potatoes, and hummus again. I also eat some of the cookies I bought as my dessert. I spend the rest of the evening messing around online and trying to hit 7,000 words for NaNoWriMo. I top out at 7,043.

I decide I want a hot breakfast this morning, so I make grits topped with cheese and eat one of my protein bars for good measure. 8:40 a.m. \u2014 I spend most of the morning reading, and then remember I have phone calls I wanted to make before I head in to work. First: I need to pay the bill for my wisdom teeth removal. I had all four taken out a couple of months ago and the bill finally arrived this weekend. I was worried about how much it would cost because I already have another big dental bill (nearly a grand) that I am slowly paying down. Fortunately, my insurance covered nearly everything and I only owe $25.20. Next, I need to make a call about taking FMLA and short-term disability for my surgery recovery period. Hopefully, these will only be precautionary measure; I saved up my PTO all year so that I could take off nearly the entire month for recovery on PTO. I ask some questions about some documents I need to send in. I need to scan and email them, but I don't have access to a scanner at my apartment or at work. It will have to wait until Wednesday night, when I will be at my parents' house.  $25.20 9:05 a.m. \u2014 Finally hit the road only to remember that I need gas. I fill up my tank roughly once a week. Gas prices aren't too terrible here, usually. My best friend recently moved to North Dakota and she says the price is terrible there.  $36.82 Advertisement 9:30 a.m. \u2014 I didn't pack my lunch today because I didn't want to eat the same meal three times in a row. I have a coupon for a fast-casual restaurant that I like, so I place an order for later in the day. With my discount, it is just $5.66. 1:30 p.m. \u2014 I go to pick up the lunch I ordered earlier. It's a chicken gyro and side order of tabbouleh.  $5.66 6:20 p.m. \u2014 Clock out and drive home. With the change in daylight savings, it is terribly dark outside. I eat my dinner\u00a0\u2014 back to the chicken, sweet potatoes, and green beans.

My mom called last night to tell me that she is getting cold feet about driving me for my surgery. She doesn't think I should get top surgery, but up until now she has always said that if I do it, then she wants to be there for me. Everyone else in the family works, and with my best friend in North Dakota, I'm rather short on options for drivers. I think she will agree to do it in the end, but her indecision is stressing me out\u00a0\u2014 surgery is tomorrow. I decide to do a little bit of retail therapy. I've been meaning to look for a fun 2018 calendar. I shop around a little bit and find one based on an anime character I love.

I meant to grab a Greek yogurt cup too, but I forgot it. 1 p.m. \u2014 Work lunch is the last of the chicken, sweet potatoes, and green beans. I was working kind of slow before lunch, but I go into hyper-drive now. It's my last day of work before I'm gone for surgery. I won't be back at work until the Monday after Thanksgiving. I want to end on a strong note and make sure there are no open assignments before I leave. 3:45 p.m. \u2014 I get out of work. When I get home, I spend a lot of time packing up everything I will need for my recovery. I've bought a lot of stuff in preparation and I also need to consider that I will be away from my apartment for about two weeks. I clean up some before I leave so I won't come home to a huge mess. 5:30 p.m. \u2014 I'm finally ready to head to my parents' house. When I get there, my mom acts like she never called me last night and of course she is going to drive me. I'm still sorta mad, but whatever. As long as the surgery happens, I will put up with everything else. 6:30 p.m. \u2014 Mom and I go out to a fast food place to grab dinner. I pay for both of us. Dad is still working when we get home and won't be back until tomorrow morning. Around 8 p.m., I eat some rocky road ice cream as a final treat \u2014 I won't be able to eat anything after midnight.

I'm not supposed to eat or drink anything because I will be put under general anesthesia. My mouth is really dry though, so I have a very small sip of water. Then, I shower with the special soap and get dressed in loose, comfortable clothes. Finally, it's time to drive out to Gainesville. 8 a.m. \u2014 After some waiting around at the hospital, it is finally time. I am rather calm. I feel like I need to be because my mom is panicking so much. Every 20 minutes, she reminds me that I can change my mind and leave at any time. I'm not going to change my mind. I've wanted top surgery for nearly a decade. I paid for the surgery upfront last week, but I'm not sure whether there is a separate bill for the anesthesiologist. I have a follow-up appointment on Monday, so I will ask then. 10:30 a.m. \u2014 When I come-to after the surgery, I'm a little agitated. But very quickly, I am completely lucid and can't feel much pain. We stay at the hospital for a while longer for observation and discharge instructions. 1 p.m. \u2014 We are back on the road home to Jacksonville. Mom gets sleepy around 2 and stops at a gas station for coffee. She asks if I want anything, but I'm worried about throwing up in the car, so I decline. Advertisement 4 p.m. \u2014 I finally have my first meal of the day: a bowl of cereal. It stays down fine. I'm really not in any pain or nauseated at all, which is a relief. Thank goodness for painkillers. Around 7, Mom makes me grilled cheese and soup for dinner. I'm still feeling well, just sleepy. She is calmer now because the surgery went fine and I'm in such good shape. Hopefully the rest of my recover will go smoothly, and I will be able to go back to work after Thanksgiving as planned.

I get ready for the day, brush my teeth, do my makeup, pack my bag, and eat the breakfast my boyfriend made me \u2014\u00a0fried eggs and avocado toast. 7:45 a.m. \u2014 I get to work after my  long  commute. I live downtown, but my job is in the suburbs so I have a 20-minute walk, 60-minute Metra ride, and a 10-minute shuttle ride. It's a long commute both ways, but worth it because I really love my job, and I don't want to give up living in the excitement of the city. 9:30 a.m. \u2014 My manager gives me a new project for the day. I need to focus on creating different juice recipes. 12 p.m. \u2014 I eat with coworkers for our daily catch-up lunch. Lunch at my office is pretty casual, and many people take the whole hour to talk and relax. I packed my own lunch and eat a caprese salad and strawberries. 3:30 p.m. \u2014 Finish my project, and my coworker IMs me that there is new food on the giveaway table. The giveaway table is where people put food samples or products they no longer need or want for experiments or taste tests. I get a bag of cookies that I've never seen before; they claim to be gluten-free, dairy-free, vegan, and organic. As someone who is not bound by any of those dietary restrictions, these cookies seem interesting... Advertisement 5:45 p.m. \u2014 Finally make it to the gym after work. I've already hit my step goal of 12,000, but I'm training for a 10K and I want to win my coworker Fitbit challenge. The gym is more crowded earlier in the week, but I manage to get a run in on the treadmill. I fill up my water bottle before I leave. 7 p.m. \u2014 Home and showered. Usually my boyfriend and I cook dinner together, but tonight his football team is playing, and it's Monday night. I decide to cook bulgogi bowls using a recipe from Jet Tila's new cookbook. We always make dinner following recipes intended for four people; that way, we can pack up the leftovers for the next day's lunch. 8:30 p.m. \u2014 Dinner was delicious! I'm always happy when my boyfriend likes Asian food, since it's all I can make well (as that's what I grew up with). I leave the dishes for him and finish taking notes for my class.

Nice and simple, but most important, it takes about 10 minutes. It's raining, so my boyfriend offers to drive me to the train instead. Yes please! I get an extra 15 minutes and eat half of a giant Costco chocolate muffin. Advertisement 7:45 a.m. \u2014 At work and the first thing I do is check for caffeine. No one has made the coffee yet, so I start the pot and make a cup of green tea. It's so gloomy outside. 8:30 a.m. \u2014 Today, the shoe mobile is here! At work, we are required to wear steel-toed boots in the plant. Our office nicely pays for one new pair of shoes per calendar year, and luckily, my 14-month work anniversary and the shoe mobile arrival are at the same time. I get a pair of sneakers; they're so much lighter than the boots I had last year \u2014 but, ugh, why do women's shoes have to be pink? ($95, expensed) 12 p.m. \u2014 Lunch! I eat the leftover bulgogi from yesterday's dinner. My coworkers and I discuss the possible changes that may be made to Obamacare, but we start to feel too stressed. It's hard to avoid politics when the only television in the cafeteria shows CNN 24/7. We attempt to make lighter conversation and talk about  Game of Thrones  instead. 1 p.m. \u2014 Back to work and about to restart the juice project I was working on yesterday, but a coworker needs help. I give him a hand, and I am rewarded with the leftover juice he was taste testing! Sweetened beverages are taxed in Chicago, so it's always great to nab some free stuff from work to avoid the tax. 6 p.m. \u2014 Felt like a slow day at work. I read  Cork Dork  on the train and finally make it home. I planned to workout, but as soon as I get home, all my desire to do so vanishes. I relax on the couch and look at camping locations for our yearly Columbus Day weekend trip. I'm leaning towards a state park closer to the Wisconsin border, and reserve a spot for the long weekend to make sure we won't lose out.  $20 Advertisement 7:30 p.m. \u2014 Supposed to go to dinner with a friend, but she calls saying her work event ran long and she will be late. She works for the Bears, so she's constantly busy with events. It's hard to match up timing with her so I don't want to cancel. I reschedule our dinner reservation. 8:30 p.m. \u2014 Finally dinnertime! My boyfriend, friend, and I meet at tavern and inn down the street from our apartment. It's so quaint and rustic, and we find out that it's still an operating inn! The only way we can afford to eat here is the $5 burger and fries special. Since we save on food, we each get a glass of wine, too. It's a great combo; burger and Champagne. The three of us split the bill.  $15 10 p.m. \u2014 Home with a food baby.

Drink a small cup of tea and get back to my juice project.

It doesn't taste too bad, but I wonder if it will make the market. Lunch as usual with the coworkers. I eat a caprese salad and strawberries. We made the mistake of trying to eat outside, and it's weirdly warm for this time of the year \u2014 about 95-degrees F. We are all sweaty and leave lunch early. 1 p.m. \u2014 Calling it a day on my juice experiments. I switch to a different project and focus on taking chemistry readings for new beverage products. Each sample takes about six minutes, and there are 20 of them. Great. 4 p.m. \u2014 Done with work! I rush to get gas since it's cheaper in the suburbs, especially since the price increased after the hurricane. From there, I head to my dad's house; my graduate school classes are online and if I took the train, I'd miss the beginning of each lesson. Luckily, my dad lives close to my job so I can mooch off his Wi-Fi. I can do laundry, too; each load is $3 at my apartment.  $20.67 4:45 p.m. \u2014 Sneak in a quick run before class and reach my step goal! 7 p.m. \u2014 Class let out early because no one had any questions. I'm working toward a master's degree in food science and human nutrition, and this class is on food process engineering. I like learning again after having taken a break, but it's not the easiest thing to balance work and school. I try to be productive since class finished early; I schedule a haircut, fold my laundry, shower, and start my homework. I start watching  The Great British Baking Show  while waiting for my dad to get home. Advertisement 7:45 p.m. \u2014 My dad gets home and brings the best warm weather dinner! We cook Japanese cha soba, or cold noodles. I love getting to eat with my parents because they feed me all the delicious, traditional Japanese food my boyfriend doesn't like to eat.

This translates to wearing steel-toed shoes, hair nets, and working in 90F and high humidity. Here's to hoping I finish my project so I can get out of here. 12 p.m. \u2014 I've never been so grateful for cold water and air conditioning. I eat lunch (delicious Annie's White Cheddar Mac and Cheese and strawberries that I brought from home) with the usual suspects. One of my friends just got back from an offsite trial and brought tacos and granola for everyone! I love the food industry. 1 p.m. \u2014 LIFE CHANGED! I hear back from a company I interviewed with almost three months ago. They offer me a full-time food scientist position! This is a huge step up from my contracting position, but I start thinking about how I love the job I'm already in. Oh well \u2014 is it appropriate to happy dance in the office?

On my walk home from the train, I pick up a fresh baguette and a celebratory bottle of Champagne from Whole Foods. Quickly squeeze in a yoga class; sometimes I free flow, but I'm so excited that I watch one of Morgan Tyler's YouTube videos to keep my mind focused.  $21.83 7:30 p.m. \u2014 My friend comes over and surprises me with another bottle of Champagne! Champagne (or sparkling wine) is my favorite; I even did my undergrad senior thesis on the chemistry of it. Together, my friend and I cook shakshuka and make a salad. We spend the rest of the night eating and catching up. It's nice to have some girl time with friends at home, something that can be difficult since I live with my boyfriend, and she has roommates. 10:30 p.m. \u2014 A little wine tipsy, but we manage to do the dishes before my friend heads home.

My cat also decided to steal the baguette from yesterday, so I spend time running around the apartment with my boyfriend chasing the kitty. The kitty is surprisingly protective of the baguette, so we decide to let him keep the bread because we don't want to wrestle him for it. Advertisement 7:45 a.m. \u2014 Work is always quiet on Friday mornings. I take this time to put the coffee on for everyone else, and when it's done I make an iced coffee. It's not the best, but it beats having to leave work and pay for Starbucks. It's still quiet, so I check my emails and read theSkimm. 8:30 a.m. \u2014 My manager says we don't have enough information from my juice experiments. Back at it again! Hopefully this works because I want this to be completed before the weekend. 12 p.m. \u2014 Lunch with the gang again. I bring the last of the shakshuka but it doesn't fill me up, so I make a salad at our cafeteria's salad bar. My coworkers and I share weekend plans, and I invite them to go wine tasting with me and a few friends tonight.  $3.11 3 p.m. \u2014 Finally finish my juice project\u00a0\u2014 but I can't leave early because I told my coworkers I'd wait for them so we can all take the train together. I keep myself busy reading BBC and checking emails. 6:35 p.m. \u2014 The train finally gets into the station. There were signal failures, and we end up nearly an hour late. We speed-walk to meet my boyfriend and our friends for a five-after-5 wine tasting. Since I brought my wine glass from the last time, I save $1 on the tasting!  $6.53 7:30 p.m. \u2014 Wine tasting is fun and delicious, and it's even better with coworkers since we are all in food science. We're the nerds arguing over processing techniques and which chemical components complement which ingredients best.

One of the gang suggests we try a tequila cocktail he invented, so he buys all the ingredients and tequila and we are all back at my apartment. Shots! 10:30 p.m. \u2014 I get tricked into an Uber that takes us to Fulton Market. I wanted to get a cheap burger and fries, but my coworker knows the chef and insists that we can get a free meal. Instead of trying Michelin-starred food, the night starts to go horribly wrong. I notice some people have left, two people get sick, and I end up taking care of them. 12 a.m. \u2014 My friend and I finally get everyone into Ubers and are satisfied that people will get home safely.

We like to plan our meals ahead of time so we don't waste food, and don't end up running around last minute looking for specific ingredients. At Mariano's, we buy red peppers, lettuce, tomatoes, zucchini, carrots, salmon, mozzarella, gouda, bread, eggs, and milk.

We get ready to leave, and turn on NPR on our Amazon Alexa so that Ancho has some \u201ccompany.\u201d Advertisement 12 p.m. \u2014 Our traditional warm-weather Saturday routine involves walking to our neighborhood farmer's market before going to picnic at an amazing, hidden-gem rooftop farm/farm stand in Long Island City. As we approach the farmer's market, I notice a very tall man thronged by people near the apple stand: it's Bill de Blasio, the mayor of NYC. Our local city councilperson recognizes us and motions us over to talk to the mayor. He is extremely tall; I suddenly forget all my hard-hitting questions, and we talk about tomato sauce. Good thing I didn't go into journalism! At the rooftop farm, we buy a loaf of bread and Szechuan buttons, because they sound intriguing. (They're unrelated to Szechuan peppercorns but produce the same numbing, tingling effect on the palate.) We mosey over to the big picnic table and set out our spread: a variety of cheeses, olive oil, pickles, fresh figs, and a bottle of white wine. This is one of our absolute favorite spots in all of New York, with a sweet view of the skyline.  $8 2:30 p.m. \u2014 Now that we're stuffed with almost an entire large loaf of bread and an obscene amount of cheese, we take a long walk to the Astoria waterfront. First stop: Socrates Sculpture Park, where they've just opened a new installation. Right next to Socrates is our next stop, Costco, my absolute favorite store. They carry everything, their workers are paid a fair wage and get solid benefits, their margins are unbelievably low, and you can get an entire wheel of Humboldt Fog cheese for an amazing bargain. When the apocalypse comes, I'll make a Costco my bunker. I can also get in and out of Costco in under 30 minutes; I've been to so many that I know the layout really well. We pick up a giant bag of popcorn, decongestant (cold season, ugh), olive oil, and an enormous hunk of Parmesan, which will disappear surprisingly quickly in our household.  $56 Advertisement 3:30 p.m. \u2014 We stop by the liquor store adjacent to Costco to buy a bottle of prosecco to bring to a friend's housewarming, and end up partaking in some wine tastings.  $11.97 4 p.m. \u2014 The housewarming is about two miles away in Long Island City; we decide to walk since it's still so nice out. My friend's apartment has an unbelievable view of Roosevelt Island and Manhattan, and the sun is sparkling on the East River. We admire the skyline and congratulate my friend on the amazing vista. We take the subway back home (I had money on my MetroCard) to drop off our groceries and say hi to Ancho; we feel bad about leaving him alone all Saturday! Ancho is my husband's first bird and they are completely obsessed with each other; we play with him for a little while and practice the new trick my husband has taught him: We say \u201cboop\u201d and Ancho taps our noses; it's the cutest thing. 7 p.m. \u2014 After drinking a glass of wine at home, we stop at the ATM to take out cash, and then head out on the subway to Corona to meet a friend at the Queens International Night Market, another one of our favorite Saturday activities. There are so many new vendors! I am overwhelmed. We queue in a very-long-but-worth-it line for Burmese Bites while we wait for our friend to join us. I get some for us to share, and we end up getting so many more things, including Peruvian ceviche, Siberian pelmeni, a Nigerian rice bowl, and Szechuan buns; we take turns buying. My husband and our friend drink beers, and we watch a professional yo-yo artist performing for the crowd with puzzlement.  $15 Advertisement 9 p.m. \u2014 We're so full. My husband and I take the subway home and hang out with Ancho before putting him to bed and tidying up around the apartment. We watch the first few episodes of  American Vandal  on Netflix (this show is amazing, seriously) and then go to bed around midnight.

He's chatty in the morning and we are trying to decipher what he's saying, but I'm not fluent in parrot yet. I hate when other people say this, but I'm too full from last night's gorging to eat breakfast. We do some cleaning around the house, and I catch up on some of the freelance editing work that I do as a side hustle. I can do it from home on my own schedule, which is awesome, and I enjoy the work; it's seasonal, and the busy period is ramping up. I negotiated a 25% raise on my hourly rate last year, so it's a great use of my spare time and talents. 1 p.m. \u2014 I brew a giant cup of rooibos and make myself beautiful tartines from yesterday's bread with lox, capers, and a fried egg. After my shower, I start doing my multi-step skincare routing from Fifty Shades of Snail and then get sucked into an internet research hole about skincare products. I started reading about Korean skincare a few years ago, and I'm a product junkie; I order a new face mask from Amazon. After I detach myself from the computer, I catch up on all the reading I need to do! I subscribe to 14 magazines and am part of two book clubs, so I have lots of material to cover. I finish last week's New Yorker and start reading Ellen Pao's book,  Reset . Ancho helps by chewing the corners of my pages and snuggling in my hair.  $10.99 Advertisement 6 p.m. \u2014 I bought tickets to a supper club pop-up a few weeks ago, and our date is tonight! Since the weather is still lovely, we opt to walk the two miles to Brooklyn. I wasn't going to drink tonight, but it's hard to say no to purchasing the carafe of ros\u00e9 our host chef is offering, now that we're in the presence of heavenly-smelling food. The chef brings out dish after dish of amazing Korean food, and we chat with the other couple who reserved seats at the pop-up tonight. We wanted to talk more with our host about cooking and cuisine, but it's hard to shift the conversation. We vow to come back! (This is a no-tipping establishment, so I pay for the wine and food sans tip.)  $8.50 9:30 p.m. \u2014 My husband pays for the uberPOOL home; we put Ancho to bed and prepare for our mornings. A bunch of the eBay listings I put up ended up selling (another one of my side hustles), so I pack up the items and print out shipping labels. After fees and shipping, I end up netting $130. Nice!

The exercise wakes me up and energizes me for the week ahead, but it's hard to get up this early! When I get home around 7, I make espresso and bring my husband his cup in bed (along with Ancho). Ancho and I hop into the shower, and then I get ready for work. Luckily, I have enough time for breakfast, so I make myself a smoothie bowl (soy milk, frozen banana, frozen spinach, frozen berries, collagen powder, maca powder) topped with the last of the fresh figs, dried goji berries, cacao nibs, my homemade granola, almonds, and coconut flakes. Ancho steals pieces of almond as I eat. I quickly brush my teeth and gather my things to leave. Advertisement 8:30 a.m. \u2014 On most non-rainy mornings, I ride my bike to work. It's the fastest mode of transportation and I enjoy the exercise. Work is fairly quiet today; I have a few meetings lined up today and a bunch of emails to tackle. 12 p.m. \u2014 I bike home for lunch, a quick salad with produce we have in the fridge. I also grab my eBay packages and stop by the post office before biking back to the office. The day is lovely! 6 p.m. \u2014 I bike home; my husband is making grain bowls for dinner tonight. He's an excellent chef, and we cook at home most nights. We have  all  the kitchen gadgets and love learning about food. There's amazing smelling rice cooking in our Zojirushi, and he has five-spice pork loin cooking in our Anova sous-vide rig. I quickly pickle radishes and nibble at the saut\u00e9ed mushrooms. After we eat dinner and prepare our lunches for tomorrow with the leftovers, we take Ancho out to play. 10:30 p.m. \u2014 We watch an episode of  American Vandal  (my husband pays for Netflix), and then head to bed.

Ancho sings through our showers and I get ready for work, then head out on my bike. Advertisement 10:15 a.m. \u2014 Gilt City is offering a voucher to a new restaurant we've been dying to try! I buy it since we were going to eat there anyway.  $45 11 a.m. \u2014 My mom has an emergency expense come up; I lend her $5,000 from my savings account and she says she'll be able to pay me back in a few weeks. I lent her a much larger sum last year and it took her a year to pay me back (no interest, of course), so I sense I won't get the money back for a little while. I check my accounts and see I will be okay. I've been saving since I was 14!  $5,000 5 p.m. \u2014 I bike home, still chilly. I've been getting fundraising calls from my undergrad alma mater for weeks and haven't been picking up; I go online and donate $100 to their new financial aid campaign.  $100 7 p.m. \u2014 I make dinner, play with Ancho, and read \u2014 a pretty quiet night.

I read  Commonwealth  by Ann Patchett on the ride and am totally engrossed. Walking through the Union Square Greenmarket once I get off the subway is intoxicating; I love the smell of fresh produce. I make it to the offsite early and hooray, there is free breakfast!  $26.20 Advertisement 12 p.m. \u2014 We break for lunch and it is an amazing catered spread: scallops, steak, a beautiful gourmet salad, creamy pesto pasta, potatoes, roasted vegetables. I overstuff myself and go back for more scallops. I can eat unlimited quantities of free food. 6 p.m. \u2014 Our work is done for the day, and we head to a rooftop happy hour with breathtaking views of New York, and more amazing catering! This group of coworkers is fun; I drink several glasses of ros\u00e9 because the bartender is awesome and the weather is still ros\u00e9-lovely. We all gossip for a few hours; I fill up on chicken satay and stuffed mushrooms. I become a stuffed mushroom. 8:30 p.m. \u2014 The group is headed to another bar, but I decide to head home to finish up a presentation I need to file by tomorrow. On my way home, I engage in some impulse shopping, inspired by the ros\u00e9. I use the PayPal funds from my Sunday night selling to purchase a new sweater, which was $50, but is technically free because I never transferred the funds to my bank account. Once I finish up my presentation around 10, I contentedly fall into bed after taking care of Ancho; husband is at a podcast taping and comes home a bit later.

I usually go five days a week but this week's schedule has thrown me off a bit. Once I'm up and dressed, I take the subway into Manhattan for day two of the offsite; commuters seem especially grumpy this morning. Advertisement 8:45 a.m. \u2014 Free breakfast! Everyone looks extremely hungover and I am regaled with tales of the group's shenanigans: they ended up being filmed for a reality show that was taping at the bar they went to after our \u201cofficial\u201d happy hour, scarfed down drunk pizza, and had a hot mess of a night. It sounds super fun but I had to finish my presentation! 1 p.m. \u2014 Another fantastic catered lunch spread, and I totally overeat again, but no regrets. The food is too good and there is an enormous red velvet cake for dessert. After lunch, I take the subway back to the office to clean up my presentation. 5 p.m. \u2014 I definitely need the walk home because I'm still in food catatonia, and I'll save myself the subway fare. Ancho is so glad to see me! I'm still so full from lunch that I can tell I won't want to eat a real dinner meal. 6 p.m. \u2014 My mom calls and says we should pick up a tree from her apartment to take to our place; it's an eight-food-tall fiddle leaf and so beautiful, but it doesn't fit her space. We walk to her house and lug it back to our apartment with a hand truck. We already have a fiddle leaf, but it's extremely temperamental, and this one is amazingly healthy. 8 p.m. \u2014 Husband and I take the bus to a concert in Williamsburg I bought tickets to a few weeks ago. This performer is an amazing artist and his social anxiety really endears him to me. We have a great time, and don't buy any drinks because it's challenging to go hard two nights in a row. When the concert ends, we take an uberPool home; my husband pays. We crawl into bed a little after midnight.

On my bike to work, I feel totally refreshed. Just needed some cool air and sunshine! 1 p.m. \u2014 There's free lunch in the office kitchen left over from an event. I scarf down soggy salad, eat a few nice sandwiches at my desk, then quickly jet home to drop off my bike. I am delighted to receive a $53 check in the mail from my freelance work and immediately mobile deposit it before bidding Ancho adieu, grabbing a bottle of Pinot Noir from our wine cabinet (for an evening event), and walking back to the office. 5:30 p.m. \u2014 Husband meets me at my office to take a long walk to Williamsburg for my friend's going-away party in a terrific outdoor space. The weather is still lovely, and we have a great time drinking wine and eating the most incredible cheeseburgers made with dry-aged beef. (My friend and their partner were both butchers.) Husband and I cannot stop raving about the burgers and eat two each, though they are enormous. We discuss the merits of different types of burger buns with my friend and agree that old-fashioned potato rolls are the best option and brioche rolls are overrated. (Fight me!) The party is bittersweet but still a great time. 9:30 p.m. \u2014 We stop by one of our favorite wine stores in the area to buy a few biodynamic wines. Wine shopping is hard when you drink a lot of wine, but we need to restock our wine cabinet and this store has a lot of unusual selections. I get a red vinho verde (yeah, I know: an oxymoron) and an unusual Italian wine.  $46 Advertisement 10 p.m. \u2014 We take the bus home, and undertake the task of removing our AC unit from the window so that we can put it into storage tomorrow morning.

I get home late on Sunday nights from weekend climbing trips, so Mondays are not my favorite. I rush to the bathroom to wash my face and dab a tincture of castor oil, lavender, tea tree, cedar wood, and niaouli. I check the weather while putting on mascara and eyeshadow; I don't wear foundation. If there's an especially pulsating pimple, I'll use concealer, but my face and wallet prefer bare skin.

I spy a soup can that was reserved for camping, but since one of my friends loves cooking while we camp (last weekend we had quesadilla burgers and burrito omelets), the soup can hasn't left the shelf. Speaking of which, I need to Venmo him gas money. I do that, eat the soup and carrot sticks, and watch  Gilmore Girls  until it's time to return to work.  $10 6 p.m. \u2014 I meal prep this week's lunches by making my staple of zucchini, bell peppers, chickpeas, cannellini beans, black beans, tomatoes, spinach, garlic, and taco seasoning all in one pot.

I try to focus on work, but I'm thinking about a guy I like, B. I think there's a mutual attraction, but he's preoccupied with work that could potentially have him move out of state so I understand if he's hesitant and overwhelmed. 1:15 p.m. \u2014 I find a quiet spot at one of the campus coffee shops and eat while reading Arno Ilgner's  The Rock Warrior's Way . When I began climbing, I didn't realize how applicable the sport was to developing a well-rounded life. You learn to trust yourself and your partner, become courageous and vulnerable, problem solve and calculate risks, respond to failure, and so much more. The downside to climbing is that the gear is expensive, and I won't be able to invest in my own rack until next year when I have fewer expenses. Thank you to my friends for sharing. 5:30 p.m. \u2014 I eat dinner. I'm surprised at how filling the cauliflower and sweet potatoes are. Vegetables as comfort food? Apparently, it is possible. 6:30 p.m. \u2014 I should be climbing, but I'm stuck socializing. My climbing partner and I chat with B. and some other folks at the boulder wall. B. and I steal glances amid particles of chalk and laboring grunts (at least I think we do) while we talk about climbing injuries. We're masochistic creatures.

I paid the entrance fee ($45) two months ago which is a bummer, but considering meals and gas, I'm still saving money. I feel bad disappointing my gal pals. We've been stoked about this competition for months, but I've had reservations about going for a few weeks and decide to listen to my gut and save the money. 1:15 p.m. \u2014 I'm about to nosh on my prepped lunch and carrots. You'd think repetition gets old but if it's good, who cares? Normally, I meal prep two weeks' worth of lunches (five in the fridge and five in the freezer) and use spices and different vegetable combos for variety. I'm not a vegetarian or vegan. Meat is just too expensive, so I save that for when I eat out. 4:30 p.m. \u2014 Off to the gym for Alpine Fit. Climb Nashville is amazing: It's $70 per month, which is steep for me, but that includes climbing, fitness, and yoga classes.

Then, he realized he's supposed to have dinner with colleagues; we part ways with him saying, \u201cIt was nice seeing you.\u201d Okay... I feel like I'm in a '90s rom-com. 10 p.m. \u2014 After a much needed shower, I heat up my cauliflower and sweet potatoes and watch  Gilmore Girls . I fall asleep once the episode finishes and then wake up to the incredibly luminous lamp above me. I pack my climbing gear and lunch bag, and then brush my teeth and fall into bed.

So, I need to figure out how to cover rent, a major car repair, and traveling to a bouldering comp in North Carolina that's in a few weeks. Ode to the stresses of money.

The whole evening is going really well: the climbing, the camaraderie. What's even more interesting is how B. and I are acting together. We're really comfortable and say \u201cwe\u201d and \u201cus\u201d like we're an item; this rom-com is taking a turn for the better.

It was such a peaceful rest day with her. We've only known each other for a few months, but we've really hit it off. I've been fortunate with the friends I've made in Nashville. Most of us are transplants and actively looking for a surrogate family. This city, and especially Climb Nashville, are definitely the friendliest places I've ever known.

Daily Total: $250", "day_seven": "Day Seven: 7 a.m. \u2014 I didn't sleep much because I was too excited. I really want to climb without falling or freaking on my project route (Christine, 10a). I know the moves, but there's one part that gets in my head and I freeze on the wall with indecision. Not today! I eat an egg burrito while changing and gathering my gear. B. arrives and we're off. 10:15 a.m. \u2014 We're at Obed, my home away from home. We go to South Clear where our projects are located and hopefully intercept our friends who arrived last night. B. warms-up on Spawn (10b/c), a route that I have a history of antipathy with because it was the highest and hardest route I was thrown on as a beginner. Out of stubbornness, I top rope the stupid route and actually enjoy myself. What the heck!? 11 a.m. \u2014 Our friends find us. Some of us move to Solstice (12a), B.'s project and I become the \u201cbelay bitch\u201d (yes, it's an affectionate term, and not reserved for only women) to B. and a friend who are both incredibly strong climbers. They alternate climbing and then give me a catch, and I barely make it to the second bolt. I'm in awe of their abilities. 1 p.m. \u2014 Christine, we meet again. I lasso B. to belay me. He gives me confidence and great instruction. I'm taking my time, breathing, and then I hit the crux and spend too much time worrying instead of doing. B. yells up, \u201cStop dancing around and move!\u201d My arms are so pumped. I try to shift over the prowl, but my grip is not holding and my worst fear happens; I take a big whipper accompanied by a scream that I never knew could come out of my mouth. My friends whoop and holler because taking a whipper means you did your hardest and went for it. I jug back up to the crux and I'm amped to make another go, but then my body begins to shake uncontrollably. All that adrenaline made me feel unstable and I ask to be lowered. I quietly sit down. B. comes over and talks to me while untying my figure eight. If I didn't let my head get in the way, I could've easily made that move. It's another obstacle I need to conquer but I'm glad I finally went for the move and let myself fall. Next time. Advertisement 7 p.m. \u2014 After a long day of climbing, we follow tradition and go to Romo's Mexican Restaurant. We're a lovely group of gross climbers who smell of sweat, dirt, and bug spray. I pay B.'s and my bill since he drove.  $22.35 10:15 p.m. \u2014 On the way home, I debate whether to ask B. if there's a mutual attraction. We're very comfortable with one another and I see a spark, but he hasn't initiated anything and I think he's the kind of guy who would. We arrive at my place, he turns off the car and we hug goodbye. I walk away smiling. I'm not going to let my impatience get the better of me \u2014 nor am I going to carry a torch for him. If he asks me out, I'll definitely say yes. But if we're just going to be friends, I'm glad for that, too. Daily Total: $22.35", "url": "https://www.refinery29.com/money-diary-nashville-graduate-program-administrative-assistant-salary"},

I requested a part-time schedule so that I could focus on my side project, Project Tater Tot. Paycheck (2x/month):  $1,198 after health insurance, HSA, and Roth are deducted Advertisement Monthly Expenses Housing:  $650. I rent the living room of a one-bedroom apartment. My one roommate uses the room and he pays for all the utilities and bills. I was worried about privacy, but it hasn't been an issue and I lucked out with this place. Loan Payments:  None.

(I pay $270 every six months.) Health Insurance:  $24. I pay partial because I'm not full-time. I don't actually know how they got this number; my company puts $108 into my HSA because I chose the high-deductible plan which is cheaper for them, so they put the extra money into my HSA. HSA:  $83, my contribution Roth:  $939. The company matches 4% (or $375). I used to do a mix of 401(k) and Roth, but I'll be making more when I go full-time. (I don't know what I'm doing.) Investments:  $910. I auto-deposit this into pre-selected Vanguard funds, in two installments. I only started investing a few months ago and previously held all my savings in a savings account. I save a lot because I don't know what my future self will want, but I know I'll need money to make it happen. I plan to use some of it for Project Tater Tot. I have $97,000 in investments, $45,000 in retirement, and $7,000 in savings.", "day_one": "Day One: 6:30 a.m. \u2014 It's been two days since the fires in Sonoma and Napa Counties started. I wake up and check the fire map. Some sections have grown but the largest ones have stalled a little. I'm a little relieved, there are also no new fires near us. I read all the news and check websites for volunteer needs. I know a lot of people who live in Santa Rosa and Napa, and my friends have a messaging group to update each other on our situations. I drove up last night to stay with my boyfriend in Petaluma. I check my work email, but everything is okay for now. Advertisement 7:30 a.m. \u2014 My boyfriend gets back from work and surprises me with breakfast burritos in bed; he is so sweet. He starts work at 7, but came back because a bunch of jobs were canceled (construction) and he wanted to volunteer today. 8:40 a.m. \u2014 We get to the volunteer center early; they open at 9. We registered online yesterday, and now fill out a health form and sit around until we get called for an interview. They ask about our health, ability to work 12-hour shifts, and what kind of volunteering we'd like to do. Then we wait for a group training at 11. It's a long time to wait and I wish I'd brought a book! We see a bunch of staff from my boyfriend's climbing gym. All the younger folks in the room are trying to crack jokes and be silly, myself included. It's nice because otherwise we'd be sitting in a room worried about the fires. There is a good mix of people of all ages in the room waiting. 10:30 a.m. \u2014 We run out to get a veggie patty sub to split from Subway for lunch later. Everything goes in except pickles and pepperoncini. I love pickled things, but only in isolation. I pay, since he bought our burritos yesterday.  $7.93 12 p.m. \u2014 I find the group training presentation useful but my boyfriend thinks it's pretty common sense. Oh well; we get laminated name tags at the end and a link to volunteering opportunities at different shelters. We sign up for the next shift at 12:45 p.m. to 7 p.m. in Santa Rosa. Advertisement 12:50 p.m. \u2014 There has been an outpouring of donations and volunteers in the area, so they tell us we might be sitting around a bit. Undeterred, we go off to try to help. We bounce around helping serve food and cleaning chairs, doors, rails, etc., but everywhere is well staffed and we feel a bit useless. We do see the donation section overflowing, and decide to get to work helping to sort clothing into different sections. After wearing masks for a few hours (since we're working outside), I tell my boyfriend that I've gained an intimate understanding of how my breath smells now. He replies that he loves me. (I love him too.) A few people come by to get clothes and we help them out. We listen to their stories, as much or as little as they want to share. Interacting with the folks affected makes it feel so worthwhile. I used to want to be a counselor growing up, and this makes me think I should do more regular volunteering. 6:30 p.m. \u2014 We leave a little early; there seem to be plenty of volunteers and we've sorted the majority of the clothing donations, so we don't feel bad. My boyfriend tells me he wants to get chili from Amy's Drive-Thru and animal fries from In-N-Out (they are next door to each other) to combine into the ultimate chili cheese fries. We discuss it, but laziness wins out and he agrees to just get chili cheese fries from Amy's.  $4.66 Advertisement 8 p.m. \u2014 When we get back to his place, we eat it with all the leftovers we have and watch  American Dad . Leftovers include half a burrito, roasted veggies, black bean burger mash, and smoky baba ganoush with crackers. (I cooked the last three and he bought the burrito.) 9 p.m. \u2014 My boyfriend's parents tell us we'll be hosting evacuee friends tonight, and we help clean a little. They're bringing cats with them but there's already a refugee kitty in the computer room; the outdoor shed is prepped for the new cats though, so they won't need to be in the same space. I debate going home or staying over tonight. Instead of deciding, we cuddle up for the next few hours, and pass out early, before 10 p.m. Daily Total: $12.59", "day_two": "Day Two: 6:05 a.m. \u2014 I wake up feeling very tired, and check all the updates again: news, friends, fire map. I also check my work; nothing new. Everything is okay, the Napa fire has grown a lot, but thankfully not in the direction of town. I try to go back to sleep but I can't for the next hour. At some point, I fall asleep. 10 a.m. \u2014 Omg, I wake up and it's 10. How did that happen?! I decide not to volunteer today and focus on resting and getting a bunch of work done. Before leaving, I snack on tomatoes that are about to go bad and baba ganoush. Petaluma was sent a warning notice this morning, which wasn't an evacuation zone, but which we took to mean, \u201cGet a bag ready in case a fire starts somewhere near you.\u201d Advertisement 11 a.m. \u2014 It's smoky everywhere, but as I stop for gas in Novato, I can see that the sky to the east is distinctly orange.  $41 11:30 a.m. \u2014 A quick stop at the 99 Ranch Market (big Asian market) because it's on the way. I decide to grab some yam greens, small head of Napa cabbage, sesame mochi balls, and a big bag of Calbee seaweed chips. I've never tried the last two, but they're on sale and I like snacks when I'm stressed. Also, grab a fresh-baked pork sung and green onion bun ($1.75) from the bakery next to the store. I haven't had pork sung (I call it pork floss) in years and so I'm curious if I still like it. I do. It's nicely salty and savory and just what I want for my drive home.  $9.04 12 p.m. \u2014 I check on the status of everything once I get home. (I am constantly checking so I'll stop mentioning it.) There's not much I can do right now, so I start working. I'm luckily at a bit of a lull in my main work project and nothing crazy or time sensitive is happening this week. My workplace, based in Petaluma, sent out a notice that they'll be paying full wages for this week while the site is closed because of safety and air quality concerns, which I think is nice. Work feels really weird, like I shouldn't be doing normal activities while the world is literally on fire around me. Email is eerily quiet, and it feels like I'm sending out emails into the void since some of the people I work with are not working right now. Why am I working? Should I be volunteering right now? I feel conflicted. I eat a lot of chips and then sesame mochi balls. I also submit 16 hours of sick time for this week, since I haven't been productive this week. Advertisement 3 p.m. \u2014 I start texting my friends who are in the fire-affected cities to see if they want to come over for dinner this weekend. I've got a few takers, so I'm excited to see them and give them hugs. 6:30 p.m. \u2014 I am very tempted to make ramen for dinner. The things is, I love ramen, but my body doesn't. I do want greens, so I stick with the plan and make a soup with the yam greens and Napa cabbage. Something about the hot savory broth and silky green leaves is comforting and fills me up with goodness. I make a huge pot, and eat a huge bowl. 9 p.m. \u2014 Damn, I have missed the past two days of my pill; this is unfortunate. I must also report that I finished the bag of chips. Daily Total: $50.04", "day_three": "Day Three: 7 a.m. \u2014 I'm out and at the gym for climbing with my friend. My friend is very stressed about work, but venting and hard climbs make us both feel great. I also find out some good news about the fires, which have gone from being around 3% contained to 18%-24% contained. It's a relief to hear that there is progress. 9:30 a.m. \u2014 When I get home, I start work and eat breakfast: soup and an open-faced sandwich with black bean patty and vegan cheese melted all over it. 12:40 p.m. \u2014 I snack on a piece of toast with vegan butter. I'm planning to volunteer for the overnight shift tonight, but haven't decided on Napa or Petaluma. My boyfriend says he's down to help, so Petaluma it is. I read an article about a man and his wife surviving the fire in a pool, only to have his wife die in his arms. I burst into tears; the perks of working remotely. Advertisement 2:15 p.m. \u2014 Lunchtime is the same leftovers. I don't mind. 5 p.m. \u2014 I'm done with work but I forgot about the rush hour traffic and need to wait it out a bit before I leave. I bring my sleeping bag just in case. $5 bridge toll on my FasTrak account.  $5 7:10 p.m. \u2014 When I get to the shelter, most of the volunteer work is with donations. There are so many, it almost seems like  too  many. We make gigantic piles of diapers sorted by size; there's also work unloading donations from cars; and always work sorting and organizing donations. A supervisor tells me that since the Coast Guard is here, it's better for them to do the overnight shifts instead of volunteers. As it becomes dark, it's heartening to see so many folks hustling late. Some parents have brought their elementary school children, who are kicking butt. 9:15 p.m. \u2014 By this time, most of the work is done; I head to my boyfriend's place to crash. Daily Total: $5", "day_four": "Day Four: 9:15 a.m. \u2014 We sleep in because we're a little too tired to do the breakfast shift, 6 a.m. to 10 a.m. 10:15 a.m. \u2014 So many more people volunteer when it's daytime! There is tons to do. It's mostly physical, moving stuff everywhere, but much better than staying in one spot folding clothes. 12:30 p.m. \u2014 We grab free food at the shelter that will go bad if people don't eat it: bagels, hard-boiled eggs, fruit, salad, and mashed potatoes. Advertisement 3:30 p.m. \u2014 On the way back to Oakland, I grab groceries for the dinner tonight: two cans chickpeas, yogurt, parsley, cilantro, plums, lemon, limes, corn meal, onions, and wine. It's later than I anticipated when we start cooking; my roommate is also cooking for a party tonight so it's a lively scene. I take a shot of whisky because cooking while buzzed is really fun. The air seems good right now so we open the windows for fresh air. It's the first time we've opened the windows since the fire started.  $24.93 6:15 p.m. \u2014 Some friends come over, and we have a good time chatting and eating dinner. I was expecting more people to show up but it works out well with a few people. We somehow manage to finish most of the food I made (probably because we all continue to munch at the dinner table as the night goes on). Dinner tonight is roasted spiced cauliflower, falafel with an herby yogurt sauce, and polenta. 9:45 p.m. \u2014 Our friends head home and there are hugs all around. We clean up and relax until it's time for bed. Daily Total: $24.93", "day_five": "Day Five: 9:15 a.m. \u2014 Sleeping in is so nice. I'm not sure why I'm sleeping so much these days. 11:30 a.m. \u2014 We're going for a hike in the Redwoods. One of the major perks of living in Oakland is that you're generally only a 10-minute drive away from hiking trails and serious forests. It smells like eucalyptus and redwoods so we hike without respirators. Advertisement 1 p.m. \u2014 Back at the house, I start working on Project Tater Tot and eat a snack of yogurt with lemon curd. 2 p.m. \u2014 Time for a plum and reheated polenta. I add more bouillon, salt, and a bit of miso, then pour it into a cake pan so I can chill it for later. 3:30 p.m. \u2014 I find a group and conference for women in clean tech and sustainability \u2014 the membership costs about $150, and the conference is roughly $100. I don't go to any events, but I feel like I should start looking into professional and grassroots communities. I pass on buying anything for now. 4 p.m. \u2014 We take a stroll and grab slices of pizza at Arizmendi (fennel, bell peppers, feta, other deliciousness on top), and then decide to also try a slice at Lanesplitter (pesto, olives, tomatoes) before going to see  Bladerunner . Boyfriend buys the tickets ($12) since I bought the pizza.  $11 7:45 p.m. \u2014  Bladerunner  was amazing! It's one of those movies that puts me in a contemplative and mischievous zone after. We walk around a bit in the area before we walk home. I read a little bit of a new book ( A Personal Matter ) and then pack up to go back to my boyfriend's place. I always feel like I carry too many bags for a simple overnight trip. I always bring work stuff, project work stuff, a change of clothes, and homemade food so I won't have to buy anything. Bridge toll again.  $5 Advertisement 10:30 p.m. \u2014 We're both energized but can't stay out too late because there's work tomorrow, so we decide to go inhale junk food. He gets animal fries from In-N-Out and I get curly fries from Jack in the Box. I honestly don't like the In-N-Out fries very much and I haven't had curly fries in years. Sooo good.  $3.23 Daily Total: $19.23", "day_six": "Day Six: 9:30 a.m. \u2014 Head into the office, which feels very normal even though we've been out for a week. The water cooler talk, as expected, is all about the fire and how we've been affected. On the way to work, I take a longer look at my hair, which I thought was in good shape; in reality, it is dying at the ends. I'm seriously overdue for a haircut so I make an appointment when I get to work. It's been a year and a half, and I cringe about having to explain the state of my hair to my hairdresser later. 10:30 a.m. \u2014 I eat the yogurt and granola that I brought from home and a plum an hour later. There's also nut mix around the office. Mmm, cashews. 1:45 p.m. \u2014 For lunch, there's a bunch of leftover cheese pizza in the work fridge which I know will get thrown out if people don't partake. Free food! (Even though I do feel a bit of pizza overload coming on.) I get into a good groove after lunch and it's a productive day. I chat with a friend at the company about a new role I would possibly take on in a few months. I'm always conflicted between wanting to pursue my Tater Tot Project and my professional career at this company. For now, I feel lucky that I'm able to do both, but I know that if I don't push for career opportunities at my company, I won't get them (when you tell people you want to work part-time, they know you're half out the door). Advertisement 5:15 p.m. \u2014 Head over to chop off some dead hair! It's $30 and I give $9 tip (exactly how much cash I have left).

I get in and out in under 20 minutes.  $39 6:15 p.m. \u2014 Oh no, my hair is flaring out because it's about shoulder length, which I hate. When she asked if I want layers, I said, \u201cUh, sure. Why not?\u201d Wrong choice. Why did I do this to myself? I visit my boyfriend before I head home. He does not understand why I'm grumpy about my hair or why I spend five minutes staring in the mirror. 7:20 p.m. \u2014 He offers me chicken curry to go with my polenta, which I happily eat for dinner. We listen to an interesting NPR  Fresh Air  episode about the importance of sleep. By this point, I'm done being upset about my hair. There's nothing I can do about it since my goal other than grow it out. 8:40 p.m. \u2014 My boyfriend convinces me to stay a bit longer instead of leaving, so I start working on Project Tater Tot while he reads and makes weird noises on the foam roller. I get in a good two hours of work, hang out a bit, then make the drive home. I am SO happy to be in my own bed, and look forward to staying put for a few days, having some alone time, and getting some work done.

I like my job, there's a lot of odds and ends I take care of today, before I do more technical work. It can be hard for people with a bachelor's degree in science to get more interesting jobs, and I think project management is something to keep in mind if it sounds interesting to you. 10:20 a.m. \u2014 I make crispy seasoned bean curd, a fried egg, yam greens and Hong Kong noodles with oyster sauce and sesame oil for breakfast. I drink the rest of my soup too. I eat a plum an hour later. 1:45 p.m. \u2014 For lunch, I add different seasonings to my polenta to change it up and eat a polenta bowl with garlic, parmesan, and a boatload of fresh parsley. My fridge is out of vegetables, so I'll have to make a trip later today. My friend left me a small green tea ice cream encased in chocolate waffle. I try it and it's really good. I've never had the chocolate and green tea combination before, I tentatively like it. 3 p.m. \u2014 Snack on yogurt with lemon curd. 5 p.m. \u2014 I do a 20-minute cardio kickboxing workout at home after work is done. I feel disproportionately proud of myself. 6:30 p.m. \u2014 I decide to walk to the closest grocery store because I only need veggies. It's nice to get out of the house and keeps me sane. As it turns out, this store is really expensive; I hone in on the sale stuff and grab three zucchinis, two carrots, and a pint of Straus cookies and cream ice cream, which is my current obsession. For dinner, I make pan-fried tofu slices with a Vietnamese marinade, a bunch of veggies (onions, carrot, zucchini), and use some leftover polenta. I share dinner with my roommate, and he shares the cherry kompot (Russian fruit drink) he made. It's really refreshing. I'm happy I've got enough leftovers for the next three meals.  $7.84 Advertisement 9 p.m. \u2014 I read a few chapters of my new book and mess around on the internet for a while.

My shoes get soaked while walking to the nearest subway station. ($2.75) Rainy days are my least favorite. Before heading home, I stop by a jewelry shop near my apartment. My best friend from college, who is in town this week for work, celebrated her birthday last week; I am treating her to dinner tonight. I get her 14-karat gold-coated, sterling silver earrings ($54).  $56.75 Advertisement 6 p.m. \u2014 Two girls come visit the apartment to see the room that is opening up. One is a second grade teacher from Tennessee, while the other works in finance. Both girls seem cordial and respectful. Given the prime location of my apartment (and it being rent-controlled), I don't worry about finding someone to fill the room. It feels like speed dating.  Do they like me? Do I like them? 6:40 p.m. \u2014 My friend and I meet for dinner at a trendy Asian fusion restaurant in the Meatpacking District. Everything on the menu looks delicious, and our eyes become bigger than our stomachs. We order everything from dumplings and noodles, to sushi rolls and sashimi. We save room for dessert \u2014 mochi! I am scared to look at the damage we've done when the waitress brings our check. Well, you only live once! The bill doesn't look so bad when you split it. At least I didn't spend any money on lunch yesterday and today. I also bring back leftovers; \"free\" lunch tomorrow, I suppose.  $140 11 p.m. \u2014 I am quite tired, both from eating all the food and from going to bed late last night. I read the latest  Time  magazine that came in the mail today (I get a free subscription through work) and hit the sack. Daily Total: $196.75", "day_three": "Day Three: 8:30 a.m. \u2014 Yesterday, a downpour of rain came in, and today came winter \u2014 the temperature dropped 20 degrees to signal that it is officially winter. I put on a knee-length, gray wool coat and mittens to stay warm on my commute to work. I recently upgraded to an iPhone 7 Plus (no, I could not justify dropping $1,000 for the iPhone X), so I asked my brother if he wanted my old, yet totally functional phone (iPhone 6 SE Plus). I stop by USPS to ship it to him in California. It should be delivered in two days.  $8.35 Advertisement 1:30 p.m. \u2014 Wednesdays are my busy days, and I'm in meetings all day. Luckily, my 1:30 p.m. meeting is a WebEx and I am just listening in, so I grab my leftover dinner from last night (spicy tuna rolls topped with torched salmon, and two dumplings) and eat it for lunch. I take two Halloween chocolates from the kitchen as well. 6 p.m. \u2014 I've been inside all day, so I can't wait to leave the office to get fresh air. I plug in my headphones, listen to music on Spotify (I'm on a free subscription; I actually don't mind the occasional commercial breaks), and completely zone out during my 40-minute walk home. I stop by a Thai restaurant and pick up chicken pad Thai for dinner.  $16 6:30 p.m. \u2014 Another girl reaches out to express her interest in the apartment. Because she can only stay for the next six months, and I don't want to go through the hassle of finding another roommate, I kindly decline her request. 7 p.m. \u2014 My friend texts me literally at the last minute, asking if I want to see  M. Butterfly  on Broadway because she got a pair of comped tickets. I've been wanting to see this play, so I immediately call Uber to get to the theater as soon as possible. I encounter some traffic, but manage to get to Times Square within 20 minutes. I am a bit late to the show, but can't complain; we have amazing orchestra seats in the sixth row. The play is beautiful, and I enjoy every minute of it.  $20 Advertisement 10:15 p.m. \u2014 My friend and I walk around for a bit after the show. I am very hungry because I didn't have a chance to eat my chicken pad Thai, which is probably all dry by now. I guess I will save it for lunch tomorrow. I really want to eat the soft serve ice cream cone from McDonald's, but give up on satisfying my craving after visiting THREE different McDonald's with malfunctioning ice cream machines. Sigh. I come home instead and go to bed. Daily Total: $44.35", "day_four": "Day Four: 8:30 a.m. \u2014 The buzzer from our cleaner wakes me up. She comes once a month to clean the common spaces (living room, kitchen, and bathroom). After I finish getting ready for work, I leave $120 (includes tip) for the cleaner. I Venmo $40 each to my roommates to split the cost.  $40 1 p.m. \u2014 For lunch, I eat the pad Thai I bought last night. I am taking the day off from work tomorrow because my dad is visiting me from Atlanta. I try to multitask in order to leave work a little early, but end up making a mess by spilling water all over my laptop. Ugh, the weekend can't come soon enough. 3:35 p.m. \u2014 Done with work! I rush back to my apartment, pack my belongings, and head to a hotel in Midtown where I am staying with my dad for the next two nights. I wanted to treat him to a comfortable visit to NYC, so I booked a king suite. The friendly receptionist offers me one of the most coveted rooms, which features an original photograph of Yoko Ono and John Lennon. The suite feels like a home away from home in the middle of the city, with a cozy reading nook by the window overlooking the Manhattan skyline and two full bathrooms.  $700 Advertisement 7:10 p.m. \u2014 I take NJ Transit to the airport to pick up my dad. On the way to the station, I stop by Pret for iced coffee, but the cashier doesn't charge me because \"he likes my scarf.\" I meet my dad at the airport and we take Lyft Line back to the city. $29 for a trip back to Manhattan is such a good deal, even though we take a 20-minute detour to drop off the other passenger in Jersey City.  $43 9:30 p.m. \u2014 Shake Shack is listed as one of the items on my dad's to-do list. We go to the original location in Madison Square Park and order bacon cheeseburger and loaded fries. Shake Shack is a bit too heavy and greasy for my liking, and I personally prefer In-N-Out. We walk back to the hotel to help with digestion before calling it a night.  $21 Daily Total: $804", "day_five": "Day Five: 10:45 a.m. \u2014 I am excited to sleep in and take the day off from work to hang out with my dad! I found out yesterday that the hotel guests can book a HIIT class at a CrossFit gym next door at a discounted price. My leg is feeling a lot better and I haven't done much exercise at all this week, so I decide to check it out. Upon arriving, I am immediately intimidated by the extremely fit men and women gathered at the gym \u2014 and they all seem to know each other. We go through a round of exercises. I am absolutely exhausted about 40 minutes into the class and decide to do the \"walk of shame\" and sneak out. No regrets!  $20 Advertisement 12:30 p.m. \u2014 My dad and I check out a new Shanghainese restaurant near the hotel for lunch. They have good lunch special deals, but I really want to try some items from the regular menu, including a giant soup dumpling that you eat with a straw. We end up ordering a bit too much for two people and feel very stuffed afterward, so we decide to walk around in Central Park.  $65 2:45 p.m. \u2014 We visit the American Museum of Natural History. (I got a complimentary one-year membership through IDNYC.) I could spend the entire day here without getting bored; the museum is huge and there is so much to see. My favorite exhibit is the \"Scales of the Universe,\" which illustrates the vast range of sizes in the universe. Every time I come here, it makes me realize how minuscule the earth is in the grand scheme of the Milky Way and the Universe. 6 p.m. \u2014 We visit an American restaurant that specializes in local products, line-caught fish, and seasonal produce. The waitress recommends ordering a bunch of small dishes and appetizers to share. My favorite is the pumpkin flatbread topped with cubes of butternut squash, goat cheese crumble, baby spinach, pumpkin seeds, and a drizzle of honey. It has a fantastic balance of sweet and savory. Dinner takes longer than expected, so we skip dessert and catch an Uber downtown for a show.  $115 8 p.m. \u2014 We have a fourth row seat at STOMP. From mops and brooms to shopping carts and plastic bags, STOMP performers use everything they see in sight to create rhythm and sound. The show is a bit too loud, and because the performers literally stomp on the stage to make sound, it gets really, really dusty.  $200 Advertisement 10 p.m. \u2014 It's a nice evening out, so my dad and I walk back to the hotel. On the way, we stop by Whole Foods so I can buy vitamins. My dad tells me he is loving NYC so far, and I am really happy to hear that.  $10 Daily Total: $410", "day_six": "Day Six: 10:35 a.m. \u2014 I am still feeling full from last night's dinner. It's a beautiful fall day, so I decide to go for a jog outside. I run for about an hour and stop by a caf\u00e9 to get a large iced green tea. I don't drink coffee, but I love tea. I come back to the hotel and take a quick shower.  $3.29 12:30 p.m. \u2014 This is the last meal with my dad before he leaves NYC. We go to one of the oldest steakhouses near Wall Street, where we indulge in Kobe beef filet mignon and whole steamed lobster. I don't normally eat like this; this is a rare occasion where I get to treat myself! After our heavy lunch, we take a walk across the Brooklyn Bridge and take pictures with a selfie stick I bought on Amazon a couple of days ago ($10).  $230 3:15 p.m. \u2014 I have a final activity planned with my dad before he heads to the airport. We visit a sleek, upscale movie theater where visitors can enjoy plush seating, gourmet bites, and cocktails while watching the latest films. Because we are still so full from lunch, we decline even the complimentary popcorn that comes with the movie ticket purchase. The full reclining seats, which are reminiscent of first-class airline cabins, are so comfortable that I hear my dad snoring during the movie. Embarrassing!  $45 Advertisement 6 p.m. \u2014 I scheduled a shuttle bus to pick up my dad and take him to the airport. I don't get to see him very often, so I really try to squeeze in as much as possible when he visits.  $20 7:15 p.m. \u2014 As comfortable as the hotel was, there is truly no place like home! I am excited to be back in my apartment and spend the rest of the evening lounging around and watching YouTube clips. I walk over to Whole Foods Market to pick up something to eat for dinner. I love their salad bar selection. I put a little bit of everything (grilled chicken, sweet potato, and quinoa) in the little paper container.  $15 Daily Total: $313.29", "day_seven": "Day Seven: 10:15 a.m. \u2014 It feels like it should be Monday because I took Friday off, but it's still the weekend! I have a pile of dirty laundry sitting in my room, so I cross the street to the nearest laundromat. I don't have a washer and dryer in the building, but because I live on the first floor and the laundromat is across the street. It has never really bothered me much, except when it's raining. I typically have to allocate at least two and a half hours to do laundry.  $4.50 12:30 p.m. \u2014 After dining out so much over the past few days, I feel the need to go on a mini-cleanse. I walk over to a juice bar near apartment and pick out the healthiest sounding cold-pressed juice, which includes kale, spinach, parsley, celery, and cucumber. It doesn't sound too appetizing, but I am hopeful my body will thank me afterward.  $9.50 Advertisement 2:15 p.m. \u2014 I have a little bit of work to do, mostly checking and responding to emails and prepping for meetings coming up this week. After two productive hours of work, I want to treat myself \u2014 so I decide to get a manicure. I pick a pink, glitter manicure to don my nails. The technician applies lotion on my dry hands and also gives me a mini-massage.  $14 5:30 p.m. \u2014 My roommate told me about an amazing sale at Madewell, so I walk over to check it out. I can't believe my luck when I find a pair of summer shorts for just $5! Best of all, they are in my size. I buy four shorts and a button-up shirt, also on sale for just $10. Even though I probably won't be able to wear these until next summer, I am still so excited for the amazing bargain.  $30 7 p.m. \u2014 I dig through the fridge for something to eat for dinner so I don't have to go outside. There's not much, but I pick out cottage cheese, microwavable mini-corn dogs, and a bowl of cereal (Special K with strawberries) with almond milk. 10:15 p.m. \u2014 I usually go to New Jersey once or twice a week for work; it's about two-hour commute from Manhattan.

Good job past me! 5:45 p.m. \u2014 Boyfriend and I eat leftover chicken lettuce wraps together; tasty! I need to rush out and head to my game, and he just got off a crazy-busy time at work. I feel like we still never see each other. 7 p.m. \u2014 I play in a Dungeons & Dragons-type RPG every other week at a game store. It's a fun hobby and not terribly expensive. It costs $15 to play and I consider it money well spent for four hours of play time. I often end up buying a cookie or something at the store, but tonight I brought an apple. We wrap up at 11 and I'm pooped. I take the subway home instead of walking, and quickly pass out in bed.  $15 Daily Total: $15", "day_three": "Day Three: 4:19 a.m. \u2014 Jesus. I should not be up this early; the test is getting to me. I try to sleep but give up around 5:30. I get up and shower while listening to the  Myths and Legends  podcast, and then make myself a slice of avocado toast. I eat half of it and put the other half wrapped up in my pocket to eat on the way to work. 8:50 a.m. \u2014 I throw out the avocado toast. It's just not happening; I'm too anxious. On the upside,  Mistborn  is getting really good. It's slow progress for me, but I like being able to read on the subway. One of my freelance clients texts me to reschedule while I'm on my way to work. This girl is KILLING me. She's a great writer but flaky and I worry that she won't get her essays done by the early action deadlines. 12 p.m. \u2014 I try to eat lunch but there just isn't any time to sit down. I'm running around getting everything ready for the PSAT tomorrow. Another teacher emails me to tell me she won't be in school and therefore can't proctor. This is, to say the least, a huge issue. I try to keep calm and handle it as best as I can. It is the first year they've had a college counselor handle this instead of an administrator, and on top of that I'm new. I don't have any authority or any relationships built so getting teachers to cooperate has been a trial. 5:55 p.m. \u2014 I leave work almost an hour late today, but I think I'm ready to go for the test. On the plus side, past me threw a banana in my lunchbox that I forgot about. On the way home another client texts me and I answer his questions. I am very careful not to cross my streams \u2014 that is, never do freelance work (not even texting or emailing) while I'm at my day job. Most of my clients have learned to call or text me before 9 and after 6. 6:35 p.m. \u2014 When I get home, I plop facedown onto my floor. I want cheese and bread. In any combo. Today was a trial. I order pizza from the super-good (but expensive) place. Boyfriend and I rarely GrubHub, so this is a treat.  $22.21 7:21 p.m. \u2014 After dinner, boyfriend and I hang out when my phone starts going off; it's my undergrad. I try to donate a little bit to something every month, so I guess this month I'll throw my alma mater $30. I had a great experience there, and I know that my poor public school is broke as hell so I don't mind giving them a little bit every year. They always ask for $100 which is too steep for me, but maybe one day I'll have the kind of money to be able to do that.  $30 Daily Total: $52.21", "day_four": "Day Four: 6:15 a.m. \u2014 I took a melatonin last night. I'm not sure I believe in it, but I do believe in the placebo effect. I sleep until 6, and then it's go time. I eat toast on the way to the subway and wear sneakers to work. You know I mean business. 9:15 a.m. \u2014 Can I put \"Years of my life\" as amount spent? FIVE teachers did not show up to work today, and it's chaos. Luckily, a lot of people step up to cover the holes in the proctoring schedule for the PSAT. I'm freaking out, but my team of college counselors is amazing and helps me through. 5:30 p.m. \u2014 My team is amazing and I love them. The test happened. The kids took it. The materials are packaged and on their way back to College Board \u2014 and I didn't even cry. 6:15 p.m. \u2014 I tutor on the side, doing college counseling (mostly organization and editing) for seniors. I am, however, an idiot and did not reschedule my standing Wednesday appointment because of the PSAT. So, off to Manhattan I schlep. I can't read, so I listen to  Dear Hank and John , a comedy podcast about death, on the subway; it helps to relax me. I stop at Levain to buy three cookies after I get off the subway.  $12 7:45 p.m. \u2014 This client is my favorite this year. He's really funny, I love his writing, and he gives me energy rather than takes it. I finish up with him and walk to the subway, giving my parents a blow-by-blow of the PSAT while I wait for the train to come. 8:30 p.m. \u2014 Eat leftover chicken lettuce wraps and sesame noodles for dinner, and explain the insanity of today to my boyfriend. I apologize for being such a stressed-out mess the last few days, watch some TV, and then head to bed. Daily Total: $12", "day_five": "Day Five: 7:15 a.m. \u2014 I sleep in a bit today. My supervisor told me to come in late but there are things I have to do second period. I eat breakfast while my boyfriend and I discuss dinner tonight. I have drinks with friends but should be home at a human hour. 11 a.m. \u2014 A much less stressful day but still SO busy. I eat a banana because I don't know when I'll have time to eat lunch. 1:30 p.m. \u2014 A meeting with a kid runs shorter than intended, so I have time to eat lunch. Yay, chili! I turn on some music, shut my door, and eat alone. 4 p.m. \u2014 I check my personal email and find out that my after-work plans have been canceled. I was supposed to meet up with grad school friends, but we're all crazy busy with November 1st deadlines. We punt drinks to next week. 5 p.m. \u2014 I head home and share cookies with a coworker on the subway. We talk about our weekend plans; both of us have Halloween parties to go to. 5:30 p.m. \u2014 Boyfriend's brother calls and wants to reschedule dinner for tonight. My plans got canceled so I'm down. I text boyfriend to coordinate. I know he's already on the subway and may not get it until he's home in Brooklyn. He's going to be pissed that he came home and has to turn right back around to go to Manhattan. 7 p.m. \u2014 We go out for ramen together. Not boyfriend's favorite, but I love it and it's great comfort food for the week I've had. We're back in our old neighborhood, and a lot of new things have opened in the past month or so; boyfriend pays for all of us. Boyfriend's brother makes a stink about the fact that we made him dinner on Sunday and are paying for this, too. It's not a big deal to us though; we'd already bought the stuff for dinner on Sunday. 8 p.m. \u2014 Boyfriend's brother asks if we want to make s'mores dip for dessert. It becomes an argument about who is going to pay for it since everyone is always trying to pay for everyone else. Boyfriend's brother pays for the dip while I'm on the phone with a client. We all try to hide $20 in each other's bags/jackets/pockets to make a point. 8:30 p.m. \u2014 We eat s'mores dip and watch  The Good Place . It is truly an A+ TV show. 10 p.m. \u2014 We head home and rush to tidy up the apartment. The change in plans led to an explosion of work bags and the like all over. I notice that there's a stray $20 bill in my bag. Boyfriend's brother must have snuck it in there. Well played. Daily Total: $0", "day_six": "Day Six: 8:30 a.m. \u2014 I AM SO UNPREPARED. The week has caught up with me and I'm scrambling to get ready for work. I decide that I'd rather be five minutes late, presentable, and pack my lunch than rush to be on time. I wear one of my weirder/brighter/louder skirts to work today. I'll dip my toe into the wild wardrobe pool and see how it goes at work. 9:05 a.m. \u2014 Listen to  Harry Potter and the Sacred Text  on the subway. It's so freaking good. Get to work five minutes late, but I don't have an appointment this period anyway, so it's fine. My skirt goes over well. 11 a.m. \u2014 Consider getting a coffee but I don't have time. Darn. 11:45 a.m. \u2014 Eat chili while waiting for a student to get their note signed. I'm not hungry, but this is my break today. 2:27 p.m. \u2014 We have early Fridays because of the Sabbath, so I'm out by 1:30. I'm heading to a freelance client but I can't make the freaking train connection I need. Very annoying, but my client's mom says her daughter is also stuck, so we should get there around the same time. 3:45 p.m. \u2014 This client has been killing me, but she's a nice kid. I'm worried that she won't make the November 1st early-action deadlines, so we schedule another appointment for this weekend. Not my favorite thing in the world to do, but I want to ensure she actually has a shot at some of her schools. 4:30 p.m. \u2014 I need to prepare an iron-on t-shirt for a couple's Halloween costume with my boyfriend, but we don't own an iron. We head to Target to buy the necessities (iron and ironing board) along with some incidentals for the apartment (more soap, a storage basket). Laugh about the fact that we are adults who don't own basic adult items. Boyfriend pays but Venmos me for half. We usually switch off paying for things, but for apartment purchases, sometimes Venmo is just easier when it's a lot.  $33.62 7 p.m. \u2014 Time for dinner. We don't have groceries because we thought we'd be out at dinner with boyfriend's brother tonight. I make the executive decision to make grilled cheese for dinner. Tasty and worth it. Daily Total: $33.62", "day_seven": "Day Seven: 7:30 a.m. \u2014 We are up and we are cleaning. There's a ton to do today so I want to start off right. This week the bathroom is mine and the kitchen/sweeping are boyfriend's. Splitting household stuff usually isn't too hard for us because we're both clean people, but because our work schedules have both been so hectic lately, things have fallen by the wayside. 12 p.m. \u2014 The game master in my usual Monday RPG is hosting another game at a different store for Halloween. I call to reserve spots for me and my sister. I have to put a credit card down; she'll probably pay me back for her $20 spot, but I won't harass her about it. She spots me for things all the time.  $40 12:30 p.m. \u2014 Boyfriend and I head into Manhattan to have lunch with a friend who is in town She's consulting in Chicago but is home for the weekend. We go out for Asian tapas. Friend is a huge food person and we're more \"eat at home to save money and cooking is fun\" people, so it's a fun splurge to see her. She surprises us by expensing the lunch, but she has a per diem and it's a waste not to use it. 1:30 p.m. \u2014 Friend wants to try Pop Bars (like gelato popsicles) which are in this area. We go because it's nice and warm out; it's underwhelming but tasty. Probably too expensive for what it is, but our friend likes all pretty, Insta-famous food stuff. Boyfriend pays. 3:45 p.m. \u2014 We get home and start putting on our Halloween costumes. We arrange the temporary tattoos I bought on Etsy, and I'm annoyed to realize one of the ones I ordered never showed up. I feel like I am missing an element and need something to complete my costume, so we head out and go to a few stores. I buy accessories that I think will round out the costumes. I spend over $50, but I am going to return about half of what I bought after I see what actually works with the costume.  $59.34 4:30 p.m. \u2014 We are dressed as Hipster Link and Zelda (yes, we are huge nerds) and are ready to go. I'm much happier with my costume now that I have a hat and a fake nose ring. We take some pictures before we head to our friend's apartment. 5 p.m. \u2014 We stop at a wine store before we get on the subway. It's our friend's Halloween/housewarming party and I feel weird showing up empty-handed. I pay, but boyfriend Venmos me for half.  $12.50 5:15 p.m. \u2014 We get off the subway and run into another friend and walk over together. This is a friend from our monthly board game night, and we decided to do a mini-board game night before the party. We play Codenames and Resistance, and order pizza before the party starts. I pay for my and my boyfriend's share.  $25 11 p.m. \u2014 It is late (for me) and I am drunk and a little sleepy. I check the MTA and to no one's shock, the subways in Brooklyn are totally messed up. I use Curb to summon a cab and boyfriend and I say our goodbyes. It feels like such a splurge, but it's worth it. I'm pooped. I pay for the cab, we take off our costumes, and fall asleep. We'll have temporary tattoos to deal with in the morning.  $17 Daily Total: $166.34 2 of 3 Next up: an accountant who makes $81,500 per year.

Cereal with milk is my usual breakfast and has been for most of my life. 12 p.m. \u2014 Head out to meet my grandma and brother for lunch after having finished one of the busiest times of the year. (I'm not kidding when I say I've seen more of my co-workers than my girlfriend in the last month and a half, and I live with her!) I head to the subway and swipe my MetroCard. Having an unlimited card is still relatively new to me. I've only had one since I moved to Brooklyn this summer. It still feels nice not to worry about the price of the subway ride every time I want to go somewhere. I do notice that the card will expire this week on my way in. 12:30 p.m. \u2014 Lunchtime! My brother and I each order omelets and my grandma gets a bagel with cream cheese, lox, tomato, and onion. As usual, my brother and I team up to make sure we get the bill. My brother pays and I Venmo him for half. My grandma covers the tip because if we didn't let her pay for something, she'd be furious. (Trust me when I say you do NOT want to see my grandma get mad.)  $21.50 2 p.m. \u2014 As we head to the subway, my brother notices my new boots. I bought them as part of a Halloween costume and also because I needed something in between dress shoes and sneakers. He has the same situation and wants to try to find the same shoes. We head back to Brooklyn and pick up my girlfriend as we try to find my brother shoes. I am very proud to say that I have the winning ones. 5:45 p.m. \u2014 Since he's already here, we invite my brother to join us for dinner. As usual, he offers to pay for part of the groceries, and as usual, we've already bought them; we tell him not to worry about it. We make chicken lettuce wraps and sesame noodles together (meaning I'm banished to the couch as my brother and girlfriend cook) and have a great time. I clean up after to make up for not cooking. Daily Total: $21.50 Day Two \n 7:45 a.m. \u2014 I'm ready for a nice calm day at work. I make myself a bowl of cereal and try to keep my girlfriend from stressing out too much about her busy week. I make lunch, pack up my bag with lunch, and a book I've been reading ( The Tethered Mage  by Melissa Caruso), and head to work. 10:15 a.m. \u2014 One of my managers emails me; he's taking a few of us out for lunch as a thank you for our hard work during busy season. Woo-hoo! It looks like leftovers can wait for another day. 12:45 p.m. \u2014 Lunch is at a fancy seafood restaurant nearby. I am pumped; seafood is probably my favorite kind of food. We all chat and enjoy lunch. The manager picks up the tab and will expense it. 5:45 p.m. \u2014 My girlfriend gets home from work, stressed as can be. She's coordinating her school's PSAT, which is this week. She takes out leftovers for dinner, but I'm still stuffed from lunch. We talk for a bit as she eats and then heads out to play an RPG game at a local game store. I pick up  The Tethered Mage  and get back to reading. 8:30 p.m. \u2014 Finished the book! I really enjoyed it. My girlfriend will be out for a while, so I put on YouTube and relax before bed. Daily Total: $0 Day Three \n 7:45 a.m. \u2014 Cereal! Milk! 10:15 a.m. \u2014 One of my mentors was going to take me to lunch today to discuss my goals for the year. Unfortunately, a client meeting came up and we have to reschedule. Oh well; the surprise lunch yesterday makes up for surprise rescheduling today. 12:15 p.m. \u2014 I eat the lunch I left at work yesterday. Leftovers are great. 6:35 p.m. \u2014 My girlfriend is beyond stressed. We rarely order take-out, but as a treat and de-stressor, we order fantastic pizza. My girlfriend and I are usually indecisive about food and both always want to pay for each other, so we came up with a rule that whoever picks dinner gets to pay. She picked dinner tonight, so she paid. I silently grumble to myself about not paying, but the pizza is so good I can't stay mad. 7:45 p.m. \u2014 Time to start the second book I bought last week,  The Shadow of What Was Lost  by James Islington. This book is much longer and the font is smaller than the last book I read so hopefully it'll last a bit longer. Daily Total: $0 Day Four \n 7:30 a.m. \u2014 Time to chomp down some cereal and milk. 8 a.m. \u2014 I'm already on the subway. I have a client meeting at 8:45 at their offices so I need to be early. 11:30 a.m. \u2014 I walk back from a client's office to mine, and quickly change out of my suit and into more casual clothing. My group at work is taking the afternoon to help prep meals for a charity that delivers to low-income individuals who otherwise wouldn't have food stability. Unfortunately, between changing into cooking-appropriate clothes and leaving for the afternoon, I don't have a moment to spare for lunch. 4:30 p.m. \u2014 We were allowed to head home after the community service event. My MetroCard technically doesn't expire until tomorrow, but I refill it on the way home. I don't want to end up late to work because I was too lazy to refill my card tonight. 5:30 p.m. \u2014 I am very hungry but also very lazy today. I make a bag of microwave popcorn for dinner. Not exactly a healthy or responsible adult choice, but sometimes you just want popcorn. I get back to my book and get lost in it until... 8:30 p.m. \u2014 \" Aaaauuuugghhhhhhuhuhuuuuu! \" That is as close as I can get to the sound my girlfriend makes as she walks in the door. Today was the PSAT. She tells me about the madness that was her day. Daily Total: $0 Day Five \n 8 a.m.\u2014 Can you guess what I ate for breakfast today? 12 p.m. \u2014 I eat the last of our leftover chicken lettuce wraps. They're still tasty, but I'm kind of sick of them at this point. 5:15 p.m. \u2014 Heading home! I can't wait to just relax. I somehow balance my 800-page book in one hand while I hold the subway pole with the other. The subway keeps stopping in the tunnels and, if I weren't so engrossed in my book, I'd be going crazy. 5:45 p.m. \u2014 I get off the subway in Brooklyn and get a text from my girlfriend. My brother wants to reschedule our dinner for tomorrow to today. That would be fine except that dinner is in Manhattan and I just got off the subway. In Brooklyn. I am way more annoyed than I would like to admit that I'm schlepping back to Manhattan. 7 p.m. \u2014 My girlfriend, brother, and I meet at a new ramen place in our old neighborhood in Manhattan where my brother still lives. I'm not super into ramen, but the other two love it. I get gyoza because dumplings > ramen. I pick up the bill because I like to treat my brother and because my girlfriend paid for a lot more of the household stuff this week. My brother is not thrilled about this since we've now paid for him twice this week (chicken lettuce wraps and this). He tries to give us $20 and we won't take it. It kicks off an entire evening of trying to sneak each other $20.  $53.49 8 p.m. \u2014 We decide to make s'mores dip as a dessert. My brother picks up the ingredients since we picked up the tab for dinner. 8:30 p.m. \u2014 We hang out in my brother's apartment and watch  The Good Place . If you're not watching it, you need to start. (I'm not even being paid to say that!) On the way out, I find a $20 in my shoe. Stop trying to give me $20 brother! I sneak it into my brother's jacket pocket. 9:45 p.m. \u2014 On the subway home, I get a text from my brother. \"So, we tied 1-1.\" I have no idea what this means. 10 p.m. \u2014 My girlfriend finds a loose $20 in her bag. My brother must've found the $20 I snuck into his jacket pocket. My brother's text now makes a whole lot more sense. It is a dumb game only played by dumb/stubborn people like us. Daily Total: $53.49 Day Six \n 8 a.m. \u2014 I'm already in Manhattan and, shock of the week, did NOT eat cereal for breakfast! I'm meeting my dad and brother for breakfast, and I get green tea (according to my girlfriend, my favorite flavor in tea is dirt) and huevos rancheros. The waiter brings me an omelet and I feel bad about sending it back, but I'm craving the huevos rancheros. My dad covers the bill. 12:45 p.m. \u2014 I brave Times Square to meet two lawyer-friends for lunch. Times Square is one of the worst places in New York, but I can't get to the restaurant without walking through it (and the sushi we have is delicious). I've been told by a mentor that starting to network now will be beneficial later. I'm starting with people I already know as friends, but not as professional contacts. I'm glad I get to expense this! ($117.41, expensed) 4:25 p.m. \u2014 I'm already home. It's very quiet at the office, and nobody stuck around past 4. I grab an apple out of the fridge and eat to tide me over to dinner. 4:30 p.m. \u2014 Target run! My girlfriend's Halloween costume involves an iron-on decal. One problem: We don't own an iron. We got an iron, an ironing board, and a few other household items. It's $67.25 in total and while we usually trade off on who pays, my girlfriend and I decide to split this one because it's reasonably pricey and all the items are home goods. She Venmos me for half.  $33.63 7 p.m. \u2014 We spend the night watching  Friends  on Netflix and working on my girlfriend's Halloween costume. She announces that she's making a grilled cheese for dinner. I suddenly have a strong craving for grilled cheese (go figure) and make one for myself. Chalk another one up to \"not a healthy or responsible adult dinner but tasty.\" Daily Total: $33.63", "url": "https://www.refinery29.com/money-diary-brooklyn-ny-couple-college-guidance-counselor-accountant-salaries"},

I returned home on Wednesday from a week in Europe, and I have had the hardest time getting over jet lag. I make myself my standard breakfast \u2014 oatmeal with almond milk and honey and a big cup of coffee. I then go out on a run for the first time in three weeks. I have been traveling a lot lately for medical school interviews as well as my recent Europe trip, and am feeling the pain. Five miles feel like 50. 8 a.m. \u2014 After my grueling run, I hop in the shower and quickly change before heading out the door to work. I only live about a mile away from the hospital, so I get to walk. It has been disturbingly sunny and warm in Boston the past couple of days, and I sweat through my sweater on the 20-minute stroll. I sit at my desk and open up my food services account through the hospital to reload it. For putting $100 on the card, I get a $20 bonus, plus using this card gets me a 20% discount on the food in the hospital food court! I head down to get a coffee and cereal cup for a second breakfast/post-workout boost.  $100 Advertisement 3 p.m. \u2014 It is a slow Friday, and one of the doctors I work for is out, so after getting sweet potato fries twice from the hospital food court (I am a creature of habit and eat very specific foods), I call it a day about an hour early and head home. On my way back I stop at the Trader Joe's across the street from my apartment (I know, I am truly blessed) to pick up some of my staples: Fiber-O cereal, unsalted roasted almonds, pretzel slims, almond milk, strawberries, blueberries, blackberries, raspberries, watermelon slices, and the Green Salad Palette for dinner tonight. Usually my parents stock up groceries but to offset the burden of my living at home, I try to cover my own food costs as much as I can. That's not to say I do not indulge in my dad's cooking every once in a while!  $35.91 8 p.m. \u2014 I was invited to interview at a medical school out of town, so I look up the transportation options I have to get there, but don't commit to anything. I am thinking of tacking on a vacation to this interview, but am debating whether I want to spend that much money. I just came back from vacation but have been saving up my days off for this autumn interview circuit, and want to indulge as much as I can! My exploration is interrupted by my dog jumping on my lap, knocking my computer aside. She has been extra needy ever since I came home, and so I spend the rest of the night giving her quality cuddle time and catching up on trashy reality TV that I missed while abroad.

I make oatmeal and coffee and rewatch last night's reality TV, which I fell asleep watching. It is my mental junk food and I am not ashamed. I then head out to drop off my interview suit at the dry cleaner's ($25). It has seen better days, and after being lugged around four cities over five days it is in need of a good wash. I also stop by the next door Starbucks and get a grande skim milk cappuccino ($4.37).  $29.37 12 p.m. \u2014 I eat a berry salad to tide me over until lunchtime. I then pack almonds and an apple my parents bought at the farmers' market, and take my dog out to the dog park. It rained overnight and it is so muddy, but my 65-pound mutt loves it. She finds the rattiest tennis ball and insists we play fetch. I can't help it, she is too cute. 2 p.m. \u2014 My dad has spent the past year perfecting his bread recipe and culturing his sourdough starter; props to him because his homemade breads have gotten much better recently. I make an open-faced tomato and cheese sandwich with Israeli cheese my mom picked up at the specialty import store in our neighborhood. I snack on pretzel slims as well. 4 p.m. \u2014 My mom drops a bombshell on me by telling me that a sibling I do not get along with is coming home the week I'm scheduled to go out of town for my interview, and is planning on staying the weekend. Given we are not even on speaking terms at the moment, this announcement reaffirms my desire to tack on more days to my interview trip. I bookmark a bunch of Airbnb rooms, but do not take the plunge as I reassess my month's budget. Advertisement 8 p.m. \u2014 Annoyed and upset, I text my friend to see if she is up to grabbing a bite with me. She is, and we go to the neighborhood fro-yo spot for sweets and heart-to-heart convo. She and I have been friends since high school, lost touch during college, and reconnected when we both moved back to Boston. I love having friends who have known my family drama for years, and I love her even more for covering my sugar high. Daily Total: $29.37", "day_three": "Day Three: 9 a.m. \u2014 I wake up at 5 a.m. again and laze out of going on a run. Instead, I make my standard oatmeal and coffee, and sign up for a marathon-training plan on the Nike Run Club app. I input the Paris Marathon date (April 8th, 2018) as my projected race date. It has been a bucket list item of mine for years, but I want to see if I stick to the plan before I officially sign up. In the meantime, I continue my pseudo-productivity by finally booking the Airbnb I have been eyeing for two nights. I have a student-host at the medical school the night before, and the time overlap between my sibling and me will be less than 24 hours. Disaster averted.  $146.96 11 a.m. \u2014 My youngest sibling comes home happy from winning a race that morning. In celebration, I make omelets for everyone. I then take the mutt to the dog park; it is sunny today and there are lots of puppy pals to play with, but she once again finds the muddiest, grossest ball and insists on slobbering all over it  then  playing fetch. I can't say no to her face. Advertisement 1 p.m. \u2014 I munch on way too many almonds and do a more intensive assessment of my finances for the near future. I schedule my last federal loan payment of $1,100, as well as a credit card payment for later in the month. Now that my federal loans are all paid off and my private loan payments are down at $280 per month, I will have an extra $1,000 per month freed up. I plan on taking a bit of a sabbatical before medical school to travel through Southeast Asia and New Zealand, and will need to save up some funds. I have about $5,000 already; in NZ I can get a working holiday visa. If I can save about $2,500 more, that will give me enough to survive for six months. I review my last few credit card statements to find where I can shave off some spending. I realize I have been traveling way too much, and start reconsidering my earlier spend on the Airbnb. I am clearly indecisive. 4 p.m. \u2014 I discuss my apprehensions with my youngest sibling, who is so much more mature than I was at that age. My need to get out of the house during that weekend is reaffirmed and I feel a little better. 8 p.m. \u2014 Mama made rice and vegan chili for dinner tonight, and we settle in to watch  90 Day Fianc\u00e9 . She and I have recently fallen in love with TLC, although her favorite show is  The Little Couple . My mom claims our dog loves  Say Yes to the Dress . No comment.

Oatmeal and coffee first thing, then I head to the gym to run on the treadmill as per the NRC app training program. It is an easy 2.5 mile run, but it still hurts. I cannot believe how much fitness I have lost from a three-week break. 8 a.m. \u2014 I pack Fiber-O's from last week's purchase to snack on at work and head out. I pick up a coffee at the food court and sit down for a day of paperwork and phone calls. As a research assistant, I do a lot of the scheduling and recruiting of patients, which means speaking to a wide variety of people from all over Boston who represent a whole host of different communities. I love this job because of the direct patient interaction; I feel like a real doctor-to-be. 2 p.m. \u2014 My lab group meets for two hours and I am bored out of my mind the entire time. I am so relieved to finally be excused. I go to the food court to get sweet potato fries and a rice pilaf dish. 6 p.m. \u2014 I make it home from work around 4:30 p.m. and take the dog out for her afternoon walk. I look at Uber prices for a different interview I have within commuting distance of Boston the next day, and am shocked to see that it would cost me $75. I immediately look for alternatives and settle on a bus in the morning. I figure I can find my way home on the way back depending on when the day ends.  $9.50 Advertisement 7 p.m. \u2014 I almost forget to pick up my suit from the dry cleaner and make it right before they close.

I slip on my heels, do my hair and makeup, and cringe. I hate the way I look dressed up. I pack almonds to snack on and hit the road. 8 a.m. \u2014 I make it on my bus and hit the road, eating loudly crunching almonds to the dismay of my weary co-travelers. Once I make it to the bus stop at my destination town, I get a medium coffee from Dunkin'.  $2.25 9 a.m. \u2014 I take the public bus across town to the medical school campus, but get off five stops too soon. Now have to march uphill in heels for a half-mile. I arrive sweaty and disoriented, but everyone is nervous too, so I feel I am in good company.  $1.75 3:30 p.m. \u2014 The interview could have gone better. I really am a bad advocate for myself and need to learn the humble-brag. I  am  getting better with each interview, so that is some consolation. Another interviewee and I get to the train station via Uber (she pays) just in time to catch the commuter rail back to Boston. I buy the ticket onboard, and she and I discuss our fears and anxieties about the application process. It is a long process that starts in June and goes on until May of the following year; once you submit your application, the wait is indefinite. It is excruciating, especially for someone as impatient as me.  $11.50 Advertisement 6 p.m. \u2014 My mom bought all my Trader Joe's favorites because she knew I would be stressed post-interview.

I have my standard breakfast and head to the gym for a guided tempo run via the NRC app. I shower and settle in for a day working from home. 11 a.m. \u2014 I buy the transport tickets to my out-of-town interview next week and begin to plan my weekend excursion as well. I text a friend in that town and we make plans for tacos and tequila post-interview. Now I am excited.  $27 12 p.m. \u2014 I eat more almonds and take my dog to the dog park, which is one of my favorite things to do in the world. Seriously guys, adopt a dog. It will change your life. 7 p.m. \u2014 After a zucchini linguine dinner, my mom and I watch old episodes of  The Little Couple . Unexpectedly, the door swings open and my sibling walks in, and I freeze. My mom got the dates wrong and this is week they are home.

After I get my morning coffee, I realize that Aunt Flo is knocking at the door. I am glad I have pads in my backpack that should tide me over for at least the morning. 12 p.m. \u2014 I use my lunch hour to step out and buy a wrap from Pret A Manger ($8.99) and some pads from the CVS ($8.99). I don't know what makes me angrier, the fact that the pads are so damn expensive, or the fact I just dropped the same amount on a wrap that is almost void of content. Never again.  $17.98 4 p.m. \u2014 The first day of my period always drains my energy. I think I might be anemic but have never followed that hunch further than that. I make it home, finish off my almonds, and curl up in a ball. I inadvertently fall asleep way too early. 10:15 p.m. \u2014 I wake up covered in sweat and ravenous for chocolate. I open the freezer and find that my mama has bought my absolute favorite Dove strawberry sorbet chocolate bars; she must have picked up on my hormonal state. I eat two, get an immediate sugar high, and then crash back in bed around 11:30.

Spaghetti squash with turkey meatballs and tomato sauce. 4:30 p.m. \u2014 The afternoon drags, but it's finally quittin' time. I meet up with my boyfriend to commute home together. He tells me about his first day in a new role. I'm very happy for him, but it also reminds me of how deeply unfulfilled I feel at my current job. It also started pouring so that doesn't help my mood. 7 p.m. \u2014 We go to trivia night at our favorite local bar, which has a burger special. I get a plain cheeseburger with no bun. I try to stay as gluten-free as possible because I have an autoimmune disease, and the symptoms improve when I don't gorge on bread and gluten. I do eat the seasoned fries though because they're delicious. We pay for our own meals.  $9.13 10:45 p.m. \u2014 Our team did pretty awful today, but I always have fun with my friends.

I prep my breakfast and lunch for tomorrow, make Sleepytime tea, and eat a frozen Reese's while watching a bit of  Law & Order .

I have another slow day of work ahead. I'm a media relations and public affairs manager for a relatively small agency, so some days are slower than slow. I'm always looking for other opportunities and trying to figure out my next move. 10:15 a.m. \u2014 I take my morning break by going on a brief walk and meditating. I recently started using the app Headspace, a free app that guides you through three- to 10-minute meditation sessions. Though I'm still new to it, I can already feel a difference with my anxiety and depression. 12:30 p.m. \u2014 Lunch is another serving of spaghetti squash and turkey meatballs.

It has SO MUCH garlic in it people can probably smell me from a mile away, but I don't care because I love it. 5 p.m. \u2014 Green tea and popcorn from my stash. I became a snacker at my old job because I worked until 7 p.m. or later, so I needed a lil' something around 5 p.m. to get me through to dinner. 7 p.m. \u2014 I stop at the store to pick up things for dinner (more mushrooms and kale), and ingredients to make snacks.  $11.55 9 p.m. \u2014 Laundry gets dropped off.

I was in a magnitude 7.6 earthquake when I was 11, and it was one of the scariest experiences of my life. There is no prep time for earthquakes, and there is nothing like walking around with your mom shopping for pajamas one second and the next, the earth starts to move under your feet and everyone is running for their lives. I research reputable organizations and donate $20. It's not a lot, but there is so much going on these days I feel like I am making donations every other week.  $20 Advertisement 1 p.m. \u2014 My friend is getting married on Saturday, and I really need to get my nails done. I was going to try to go to my favorite nail salon in my hometown the day of, but with hair and makeup appointments that day too, I know it will be too crazy to also do nails. I look online for salons that do SNS powder gel and head over. I don't care what anyone says about SNS; it lasts three weeks with ZERO chips, and I love it.

I stop at Whole Foods and buy more ingredients for the snacks and shakshuka, a weekly staple at our place; it's easy to make and is great for work lunches. I also buy kombucha and strawberries.  $30.72 8:30 p.m. \u2014 It's been a cooking marathon tonight! I chop everything for shakshuka and while it cooks I make the snacks. I'm making a vegan recipe, so I use banana and coconut oil instead of butter. Only BF is strictly vegan, but I have to say it's very satisfying to find a delicious vegan recipe. 9 p.m. \u2014 OMG: BF makes a surprise appearance! I knew he was starting to miss me. We hang out, and he tries to eat all of the snacks I made, but I have to stop him because I want to share them at work! BF leaves to go back to his dog-sitting duties, and I watch an episode of  Gilmore Girls  that I've already seen a million times and go to bed.

Not getting a good spot for a class gives me so much anxiety. Sometimes I don't even go to the class if I'm going to be less than five minutes early. 9:30 a.m. \u2014 Yoga class and cardio were fab, and I'm feeling great today! I make breakfast and resist eating one of the snacks with every fiber of my being. I only have 10 left and haven't even shared yet.

The bride is really stressed out, but we manage to get everyone together to go through the motions of the big day, and I think everyone will be prepared. The father of the bride brought sandwiches for everyone, so we eat and hang out for a bit. Most of the bridal party leaves, but the bride and groom, and a few other bridesmaids and I head to the bar next to the venue for a post-rehearsal drink. I buy the first round. Hanging out with everyone is nice, but everyone around me feels so grown up with all of their baby and wedding talk; I start to feel restless. I'm so happy for my best friend, but I am  not  ready for the responsibilities of marriage or motherhood. I need a break and ask my younger sister to pick me up.  $26 Advertisement 9 p.m. \u2014 I'm definitely feeling the vodka sodas I just had, and my sister is also in a \u201cfun\u201d mood. She somehow convinces me to go out and drink more vodka in her room, but after being around all the \u201calmost grownups,\u201d I decide to join the recklessness. My boyfriend is working until midnight anyway, so it's not like I have anything else to do! My sister lets me borrow her clothes, and we pregame in her room while our mom watches TV upstairs. Feels like high school and I love it. 10 p.m. \u2014 We take an Uber to a bar about 15 minutes away (not like high school). After checking my credit card the next morning, turns out I spent $24 on drinks at the bar we went to.  $24 11:30 p.m. \u2014 Eventually, I realize my sister is too drunk to be out, so I call an Uber to come get us.

I text my sister and ask her WTF happened to my phone, but she is in a worse state than I am and has no idea. I text the bridesmaids that I'm running late but will stop by before my Drybar appointment at 11 a.m. I tell my sister to come pick me up so I can go pick up my bridesmaid dress at the tailor ($20) and so we can get hangover-fighting green smoothies ($7).  $27 9:30 a.m. \u2014 We get to my parents' house and my phone is nowhere to be found!

It's in a room I didn't check earlier. THANK GOODNESS! I text the bridesmaids that I am on my way! 10 a.m. \u2014 I get to the hotel room and hang with the bridesmaids, trying desperately to hide my hangover. Luckily, everyone is focused on the bride.

They offer me coffee!  $1 Advertisement 12 p.m. \u2014 Honestly, I really don't like how my hair turned out. I look like a schoolgirl and the look just isn't working, but today is not about me and I don't have time to complain and fix it. I pay and head back because my makeup appointment at the hotel is next.  $65 1 p.m. \u2014 Back at the hotel and everyone is in a frenzy trying to get ready. The photographer is taking pictures, makeup is getting done, people are getting dressed, the flower girls are crying and need attention, but there are mimosas and everyone is loving the excitement. I drink a mimosa, and I think my hangover is finally gone! 2:30 p.m. \u2014 Finally my turn for makeup. I honestly don't wear much make up, and I think $100 is a lot of freakin' money for it, but all the bridesmaids are doing it, and I'm a team player.

The ceremony was beautiful, and the weather was perfect. The newlyweds are high school sweethearts, and my friend reads what she wrote to her hubby in their senior year yearbook; everyone cries, including me. As much as I shy away from grownup stuff like marriage, it's beautiful to see two people so happy together. Advertisement 5:30 p.m. \u2014 We dance the night away, and it's a perfect night! My boyfriend and I give $85 to the bride and groom, but I pay $60 because he doesn't want to give more than $25. I don't feel like fighting about it, and she's my best friend, so I don't mind chipping in extra. I would give more, but I already spent so much on the bachelorette, bridal shower gift, dress, makeup. It's been a lot! Everything goes without a hitch, and the bride and groom are happy as can be.

I planned to eat sad leftovers from last week, but my boss treats us to Chipotle. As sad as I am to throw away food, I'm not complaining about Chipotle! I get a sofritas salad bowl with spicy salsa, chips, and tap water.

The cashier accidentally takes two customers ahead of me, even though I was standing in line, so he gives me my drink for free! It was annoying to be ignored, but my grande coconut milk mocha macchiato is worth it. 5:30 p.m. \u2014 My attention span is getting shorter, so I take a quick break to buy train tickets to go to NYC next weekend. I went to school in upstate New York, but lived in Atlanta for the past two years. I'm so excited to see some of my college roomies! I buy two Amtrak tickets for me and my husband for next weekend, including a disability ticket for myself because the trip is more than two hours. I'll need an aisle seat to stretch my legs and back midway through our journey.  $250 6 p.m. \u2014 Finally break for the night. I head to orientation for a mentorship program I'm doing to help first-generation college students. Even though I'm not a first-generation college student, I relate a lot to those students since I grew up on a farm and my mom didn't have contacts I could leverage to get a corporate job. Tonight's the first night and it's the mentors only, so we can get to know each other and learn the curriculum for the semester-long program. There are some sad looking sandwiches; I stick to water.

Ankylosing spondylitis is a condition that attacks my spine; my sacroiliac (SI) joints and lower lumbar spine are already \u201cfused,\u201d which means there is calcification over the joint and it is no longer flexible. If I don't work out, the fusions could continue, or the current fusions will cause pain as it's harder for my body to naturally pump fluid from my spine to my other joints. Right now, I'm able to manage my disease with exercise and medication, so I still feel lucky. 7 a.m. \u2014 Head into work early for a meeting. I sip my coffee during the walk, dig into my parfait at the office, and start working through a data visualization for our big meeting tomorrow. After working in a conference room yesterday, I'm happy to be back at my desk! I have a standing-sit desk to alleviate my back pain.

Usually I'd cook, but I have a head cold and don't feel like getting off the couch. We settle on cheesesteaks: he gets a classic one and I get balsamic brie.

As a bonus, my boss brought donuts from an amazing local place and Starbucks coffee. At this point, I'm over-caffeinated; it is probably a good thing because I think my head cold is getting worse. It's a little early for lunch, so I eat a Larabar I packed. 12 p.m. \u2014 My boss says I can head out early since I was in the office so early. I work through lunch, and snack on pretzels and Laughing Cow cheese I brought to tide me over. 3:30 p.m. \u2014 Home and I'm starving!

At first I thought buying groceries online for home-delivery was a luxury, but even with the delivery cost, it's still very affordable. The only options close to our apartment are Whole Foods, which is usually too expensive, and Trader Joe's, which doesn't have everything we need. We do a grocery delivery order once every 10 days or so. I typically look for whatever meat is on sale and build meals around that. This week, spaghetti squash and bone-in pork chops are on sale, so I get those along with apples, bananas, blueberries, kale greens, dates, scallions, oranges, parsley, pears, radishes, raspberries, strawberries, ground lean beef, vanilla yogurt, orange juice, frozen cherries, frozen edamame, unsweetened cocoa, cumin, sea salt, cinnamon sticks, cloves, unsweetened coconut, almond butter, and marinara sauce.  $94.74 Advertisement 6 p.m. \u2014 Tonight, I want to use up the rest of the food from our last grocery order. I make creamed kale with shallots and roasted pork with onions. 7 p.m. \u2014 When we moved to Philly, my husband stayed with the same company but moved to a different department. He attends a lot more client meetings in his new role, so he needs more sports jackets. We look online for good deals and finally land on Macy's.

Yes, it's the same shot you see advertised on TV all the time \u2014 though the commercials fail to state that Humira is a HUGE EFFING SHOT that hurts pretty badly. For me, Humira stops my spine from fusing and limits my flare-ups. It does have some annoying side effects, especially fatigue, but I've really gotten my life back since I started taking it two years ago. I get up, wash my face, and start dreading my shot. 8 a.m. \u2014 It's shot time. I've had a needle phobia since I was a little kid (I had to get the rabies shots at two years old), and my husband still injects me. The shot takes about 10 seconds to administer and I don't trust myself to not pull it out. We start our usual shot routine: My husband gets everything ready while I blast Eminem's \"Lose Yourself\" to get myself pumped. The whole process takes about 10 minutes. I am prescribed Xanax since I have such bad shot anxiety, but I'm trying to use breathing techniques to make it through. Today is relatively uneventful (with a couple of swear words thrown in). Afterwards, I make some coffee to put in the freezer (I forgot to make it last night) and eat a coconut RXBar.

He tells me I'm good to sign off if I have everything done. My boss and I get along well, and he's great about work-life balance and helping me elevate my work. I finish off a few things and then get to cooking! I prep two spaghetti squashes and put them in the slow cooker for six hours. Then I make two batches of chai tea from scratch, which I love to drink in the afternoon. After, I make raspberry-lemon yogurt popsicles. I love having something sweet after dinner, and these are relatively healthy. I sample everything I'm making and eat a Chomps meat stick for lunch. 7 p.m. \u2014 My brother-in-law and his husband are in town for the weekend, so we meet up with them for dinner. We saw them a few weeks ago at our wedding, but it's nice to see them again so soon since they live in South Carolina.

I meet up with my husband at the mall, where he bought a few pairs of pants on sale at Gap. I wander into Loft Outlet and buy two sweaters that are on sale. Afterwards, my husband buys a pretzel. I try not to eat any, but end up taking two bites. My husband wants to buy a smoothie but I remind him we already have all the smoothie makings back home.  $50 3 p.m. \u2014 On our way home, we stop at Trader Joe's to pick up a few things I need for recipes: pizza dough, dates, and milk. We walk another two blocks home and I make us smoothies with frozen banana, frozen blueberries, fresh strawberries, and OJ. I also make myself a chai tea latte; surprisingly, it's delicious! I'll be remaking this recipe for sure. We waste the rest of the afternoon watching  Pool Kings . I'm addicted to HGTV; what can I say?  $7.49 7 p.m. \u2014 Some of our friends are heading to Applebee's for $1 margs and I can't say no. We meet them around 7 p.m. and walk the mile to the restaurant. Once we're there, we take turns buying rounds while we wait for our table. Once we get seated, we can take advantage of half-off apps! One of my friends and I split a pretzel with beer cheese, and my husband gets mozzarella sticks and a steak quesadilla. Some of the group goes out on the town, but the rest of us head back to our apartment.  $36.80 Advertisement 9 p.m. \u2014 I whip up a quick sangria by cooking apples, strawberries, and lemon in sugar water and then putting the fruit and liquid in an ice bath. While it cooks down, I mix ros\u00e9 and rum, and then add the fruit. We go to our friends' apartment with the sangria and our dog so he can play with our friends' puppy. I drunkenly tell everyone (about 10 times) that I want to be the modern-day Martha Stewart \u2014 minus the jail time. (Sober me still concurs.)

My husband is still sleeping, so I go into the kitchen to start cooking. I make batter for Giddy-Up Energy Bites from my  Run Fast. Eat Slow  cookbook, which I love. (The batter has dates, cranberries, almond butter, walnuts, Nutella, coconut, instant coffee, and salt.) I make a triple batch and freeze the extras. I also put ingredients for mulled wine (apple cider, red wine, cinnamon sticks, cut up oranges and apples) in the slow cooker so we can sip on that throughout the day. Then I take out the pizza dough we bought yesterday to make another batch of the mashed potato, bacon jam, and scallion pizza. 10 a.m. \u2014 My husband finally gets up. I beg him to go to Whole Foods because I'm craving fresh pico and don't have any of the ingredients. I promise to bring the dog out the rest of the day and he agrees! He picks up the pico and I make us breakfast sandwiches (whole-wheat English muffins, eggs, goat cheese, and pico). After breakfast, I do some yoga stretches to help with my back. I'd usually go to a class, but I can't stop coughing and don't want to bother everyone.  $4.29 Advertisement 3 p.m. \u2014 Some of our friends from the development stop by with chips and salsa! We hang out with them and play several rounds of the card game Exploding Kittens. It's been our go-to Christmas/Secret Santa present because the game is easy to learn and so much fun to play. We also drink all the mulled wine. 6 p.m. \u2014 Our friends head out and my husband gets back into the football games that are going on. He's always super into his fantasy team, while I couldn't care less. I clean up the kitchen and get started on dinner: Asian salmon in steamed bok choy wrappers. Dinner is a smashing success and we have lots of salmon left over. My husband continues to watch football and I watch a few episodes of  Beachfront Bargain: Renovation  in bed. I end up researching the Pillsbury bake-off competition and make a mental note to submit a few recipes. Daily Total: $4.29", "day_seven": "Day Seven: 6 a.m. \u2014 Ugh. It's early but I need to get up. Two weeks ago, we were in a minor car accident and I need to drop off my car to get fixed. I get up, wash my face, and pack lunch. I don't feel like trying to divvy up the salmon or the spaghetti pasta, so I make a snack lunch of pretzels with Laughing Cow cheese, a few Giddy Up energy bites, a Larabar, and raspberry yogurt with granola. I leave all my work stuff because I'll have to come back to drop off the rental car. Advertisement 7:30 a.m. \u2014 I get to the car collision place. They check out my car and guess that the back bumper and collision bar will need to be replaced (which goes to show you how hard we were hit). The car behind us hit our car twice because the driver \u201ccouldn't find the brake.\u201d My husband ended up with a concussion and I got whiplash, but the car was actually in decent shape \u2014 or so we thought! We hired one of those billboard lawyers to help navigate the claims process, especially since we're concerned there may be long-term effects from the accident. After talking with the body shop folks, they set me up with the rental car place. The whole process is quick and within 20 minutes, I drive out in a Nissan Rouge. Everything will be covered by insurance, but the car requires a $50 deposit that will be reimbursed when returned.  $50 8 a.m. \u2014 I get back home sooner than expected and have time to make a nice breakfast. I make breakfast sandwiches with goat cheese, pico, and an egg on whole-wheat English muffins. We eat breakfast while watching CNN and then head into work together. 9 a.m. \u2014 My boss is still in Chicago so I have a lot to cover while he's gone. I chug the rest of my coffee, put on some Latin pop music, and get to work. 12 p.m. \u2014 I'm shocked at how late it is! I got a lot accomplished this morning and still have a few things I'm hoping to knock out, so I work through lunch. I eat the snacks I prepared this morning. Halfway through lunch, the garage calls to let me know that my car will take about three days to fix (at no cost to me). Advertisement 2 p.m. \u2014 A recent graduate of my alma mater reached out for career advice last week and I happily set up a call. It was exciting to be identified as a \u201csuccessful young professional\u201d worthy of giving professional direction. We chat for 30 minutes while I munch on a Larabar. 5 p.m. \u2014 Head out of work because my attention span is waning fast. I meet up with my husband to trek the 20 minutes home, where we have a \"free-for-all\" dinner \u2014 basically whatever leftovers are left. He settles for pizza, while I reheat some the salmon from last night. We hang out watching recorded late-night talk shows until he leaves at 7:45 p.m. for his soccer league. I go to the gym in our apartment complex and hop on the elliptical. 9 p.m. \u2014 When I get back from the gym, I take the pupster out and tidy up. One of my friends texts to let me know there's now an expansion pack to Exploding Kittens and I have to get it! It's available on Amazon for $14.99. When I go to buy the pack, I notice a few things in our cart from my husband \u2014 deodorant, shampoo, and dry Swiffer pads.

I need to move everything out of my bar area since it's being demolished and replaced with new cabinets, marble countertop, and a built-in wine fridge (most excited about this part). The kitchen countertop is also being replaced with marble, and I'm adding tile and trim around my fireplace along with other cosmetic improvements. Make myself a Nespresso with brown sugar and get to work. 8:30 a.m. \u2014 Contractor arrives! They set up their equipment while I login to work from home for the day. Decide that I should probably eat something before demolition begins and my kitchen is out of commission. Toast olive bread and top it with fresh Greek feta and fig jam. Advertisement 9:45 a.m. \u2014 My contractor informs me that he wasn't able to find the bar items I picked out in stock at Home Depot, so we go online to order them. I purchase the bar sink and faucet ($159 for both) and the 33 bottle built-in wine fridge ($470) to be delivered to the Home Depot close to my house. On the bright side, this ends up saving me the overhead cost of him buying them for me.  $677.75 10:30 a.m. \u2014 Decide that I absolutely need to order Halloween costumes for my boyfriend and me today. After texting back and forth, we decide on Morticia and Gomez Addams. I order a cheap pinstripe suit for him and a wig and dress for me.  $58.71 2:30 p.m. \u2014 Can't make my usual amount of sales calls today with all the noise, but still manage to be productive. I made a big sale last week (biggest one yet!), so I don't feel as guilty having a catch-up day or two. I sneak into the kitchen to grab a snack of pita chips and chipotle bitchin sauce. 5 p.m. \u2014 Contractor wraps up, and I get ready to head to church to direct Greek dance. There's a big national competition every year that we're preparing for. I grew up doing it, and it's a huge passion of mine. I direct with my two best friends which makes it even more fun. I stop at Jimbo's on the way to grab a tropikale smoothie and a salad from the salad bar.  $14.68 Advertisement 9:30 p.m. \u2014 I get home from Greek dance and climb into bed.

Extremely grateful for my flexible work schedule. Because I'm in a sales role covering the western U.S., I do a lot of traveling usually. On weeks that I don't have any travel scheduled, I try to work from home as much as I can. 10 a.m. \u2014 Make myself a twist on a shakshuka for breakfast: pancetta, shallots, mushrooms, red peppers, tomatoes, garlic, and basil serve as the poaching sauce for my two eggs. I crumble feta on toward the end and soak it up with more toasted olive bread. Eat at my desk. 11 a.m. \u2014 Pack up all my stuff for the next few days.

He's planning on moving in with me come January, so we're trying to enjoy his city as much as possible. 11:30 a.m. \u2014 Brazilian sugaring appointment.

Meet with my boss who gives me feedback about an investment committee meeting from Monday in which one of my proposed investments was discussed and eventually approved. He encourages me not to get defensive when fielding questions from committee members in the future, and I agree that that's something I need to work on. He's really happy with my performance overall, especially in light of the big signing last week. 5 p.m. \u2014 Stop at Trader Joe's on my way to the BF's house to get supplies for the next couple days. I get chicken thighs, whole grain mustard, tomatoes, baby lettuce, shredded carrots, avocados, green onions, cave-aged blue cheese (new item!), bacon, eggs, bananas, blueberries, greek yogurt, lemons, garlic, and a pack of the dark chocolate Quadratini wafers (BF and I are addicted).  $50.64 6:30 p.m. \u2014 Start marinating the chicken thighs in a honey mustard sauce (whole-grain mustard, spicy deli mustard, honey, salt, pepper, lemon juice) and quickly fry up four pieces of the bacon.

Ideally, I'd drive a more fuel-efficient vehicle, but I love my SUV and all the space. Our dogs fit comfortably, and once we have kids, it'll fit the whole family. Plus, once the Model 3 is available, we're getting one for my husband, and that will ease my gas mileage guilt.  $42.67 9:45 a.m. \u2014 H-E-B offers curbside pickup for groceries and it is amazing. I go online to their website and order our groceries for the week. They charge more than in-store prices, but since it keeps me from impulse shopping, I've saved quite a bit in the long run. I pick out chicken, shrimp, ground turkey, mushrooms, romaine, tortillas, 2% cheese, waffles, Lunchables, enchilada sauce, buffalo sauce, other produce, wine (DUH), paper plates, new Holiday glade plug-in refills, and Skinny Cow ice cream. I pay for everything and I'll pick it up on my way home.  $97.25 Advertisement 11 a.m. \u2014 Lunchtime! Everyone in my department goes to lunch at 11 a.m., something that took getting used to when I started this job in June. Now I can't imagine eating any later and at 10:55 \u2014 my tummy is growling. I walk the quarter-mile from my building to the onsite cafeteria and browse through the choices. It's underwhelming, so I opt for the deli line. I get a turkey-chicken wrap with avocado, baked Lays, and a bottle of water. Lunch is expensed because my company deposits $30/month onto our badges for use in the cafeteria; they also match the $30 I contribute, so I end up with $90/month for only $30; it's a great deal. It's almost the end of the month, so I have about $22 left. Only one more day and I'll get another $30, so I'm not worried. ($4.75 expensed) 2:15 p.m. \u2014 I should learn that when I get the deli line food, I always end up hungry in the afternoon. If it weren't such a long walk, I'd go pick up fruit or a healthier snack, but that walk is brutal and it's unnecessarily hot and humid today, so vending machine it is! I get Goldfish crackers and eat them at my desk while I browse the internet.  $0.75 2:45 p.m. \u2014 I love my job and the people I work with but to be honest, I could do my job in 20 hours a week or less. I've expressed this to my boss and he's working on getting me more to do. Until then, I spend the majority of my day browsing the internet and getting paid good money to do it; could be worse! I end up on Wish, a shopping site that's my weakness. Everything is so cheap and I've always liked what I've ordered. My sister-in-law's birthday is the day before Thanksgiving and she has wanted studded-heel booties for a while; I find the pair she likes for half the normal price and add them to the cart along with cute kitchen gadgets I can put in my mom's stocking. I also add a sweet necklace for my husband's grandmother and a necklace for my sister-in-law. I enjoy buying Christmas gifts early! Makes me feel ahead of the game.  $36.75 Advertisement 3:15 p.m. \u2014 We are hosting our first Thanksgiving this year and I am determined to make it beautiful. My best friends are flying down from Dallas (yes flying \u2014 that drive is literally the worst) and that has increased our guest count to 10. I only have eight cute napkins and napkin rings, so I go to Target.com and order one more set of each. I also decide to order cute wifey and hubby coffee mugs because I'm a newlywed and am a sucker for all things husband/wife. I browse all their holiday collections but decide to wait and go in person with my husband.  $47.50 5:30 p.m. \u2014 Made it to H-E-B and they had to substitute a few items, but luckily the price difference was super minimal. They load everything in my car and I head home. I'm greeted by my sweet husband and our two adorable dogs. I pour a glass of wine and sit on our patio while they run around and play. I turn on the grill because tonight we're eating grilled buffalo chicken sandwiches. My husband brings everything out so I can keep playing with the pups. They're both rescue dogs and are truly the light of my life. Anything I can do to make them happy fills my heart with so much joy. Of course, this means they get some of the cheese I'm putting on the chicken. Spoiled doggos.  $1.72 9:15 p.m. \u2014 As we get ready for bed, my husband mentions that he wishes he had more bandanas for work. He only has two and he hates wearing them multiple days in a row. His job is all manual labor and the bandana helps keep him warm when it's cold as well as helping collect sweat in his hard hat. I tell him to order some but he reminds me that I'm the one with the Amazon Prime info, so I hand him my phone and places the order. We combined our finances long before we were married. I have always made more money than him, but I also spend significantly more money than he does, so it has never bothered me to combine things. I sometimes feel guilty because he ALWAYS asks before he buys things and I never do. I don't know if that'll become a point of contention once we are out of the honeymoon phase. Time will tell.  $15.42 Advertisement Daily Total: $242.06", "day_two": "Day Two: 7:30 a.m. \u2014 On my way to work and running a little late so I take the toll route.

We aren't carpooling today though because it's HALLOWEEN! Trick-or-treating starts at 5:30 p.m. in our neighborhood. I won't be home by then, but I wanted my husband to get back in time to start handing out candy.

I proceed to walk around the site and eat my fruit. It's kind of cold and drizzly, but I'm wearing the right jacket and it doesn't bother me. 5:55 p.m. \u2014 My husband calls and tells me about the groups of trick-or-treaters coming down our street, and that a house on our cul-de-sac turned into a haunted house. He also says he was a little heavy-handed with the first few groups and we will need more candy. I stop at Walgreens and pick up two more big bags. I get Reese's because that's what I would want and I fully intend to enjoy some. I also pick up a bottle of red wine because all I got from H-E-B yesterday was white wine and it's chilly out.  $27.40 Advertisement 9:30 p.m. \u2014 We blew through five large bags of candy tonight and still had to turn our porch light out early. It was so much fun. We sat in our front room and played Jenga, drank red wine, and passing out candy.

I get in the pizza line, which is notoriously long and slow, but the pizza is good and worth the wait. Twenty-five minutes later, I'm sitting down for lunch. My department always has two to four tables pushed together and we eat as a group. It's such a nice change from my last job where I would eat alone at my desk.  $30 5:25 p.m. \u2014 The day flew by because I had an afternoon full of meetings. I wasn't able to do any internet shopping, so that's for the best! On our way home, we decide to go to a game shop and pick up Reaper Minis, little game figurines that are typically unpainted. I'm not going to use them, but I'll enjoy painting them with my husband. He plans to use them for when he plays Dungeons & Dragons. He's a gamer and I'm not, but we find small ways to do things together and painting little warriors sounds fun. We will order the paints on Amazon tonight.  $26.40 Advertisement 7:30 p.m. \u2014 We sit down for dinner and look through Amazon to find the right paint set and place the order.

These friends are our only \"couple\" friends and we really enjoy hanging out with them. I'm looking forward to this next week!  $60 11 a.m. \u2014 Thursday is build your own pasta day, but I'm not feeling it. I opt for a salad and a big cup of soup. The total is less than $5 and I'm very pleased with my choice. I sit with coworkers who are mostly talking about work today.

Our house has vaulted ceilings and I told him how much I wanted a tall Christmas tree this year. I also mentioned how bummed I was that they're all so expensive. The link he sent is to a 12-foot tree for only $225! I'm sold and so excited. It's a great price and will look stunning in our front room. We plan to put our old, dinky, five-foot tree in our den. Two Christmas trees to decorate; I can hardly contain my excitement. I tell him how happy I am and thank him for even looking. I message the seller and agree on the price. We will pick it up Saturday morning. I go to the ATM onsite and get the cash. I'm glad USAA reimburses ATM fees otherwise I'd be annoyed by the $3 fee they charge.  $225 5:30 p.m. \u2014 We both enjoyed that red wine from Halloween so much that I stop and pick up another bottle; we're watching more  GoT  tonight. When I get home, I dance around the front room daydreaming about the huge tree that will be here soon. I start to wonder if it would be weird to have it up for Thanksgiving.

She knows several people who work here, so no one will mind that we plan on holding this table for at least three hours. When it's finally time to head out, I pay for both of our meals and drinks.

At Macy's, I look for the boots that sold out yesterday and have no luck, but I find something similar. I also scope out a pair of riding boots that I wanted to see in person before ordering. At the register, they won't let me use my additional 25% coupon on top of the sale, which annoys me to no end. I buy the booties anyway since I want to wear them tonight ($42.21). On my way out of the mall, I get on the Macy's app and order the booties plus the riding boots and use the extra 25% off coupon they insisted wouldn't work. I'll return the second pair of booties once the come next week. I get a killer deal and pay way less than half for each pair ($120.63 for both).

I make that and settle in for a client call. 12:30 p.m. \u2014 B. calls and asks if I want to meet him and another one of our friends for lunch. I head down to Cherry Creek and meet them at Bombay Clay Oven where we all get the buffet and split the check three ways. Parking in Cherry Creek is a nightmare, so I park in my friend's office building where she will validate it for me later and save $8.  $18.46 Advertisement 2 p.m. \u2014 B. and I decide to cross the street to the mall; he needs a belt and I want to look at a ring in David Yurman that I'm thinking about buying myself for my birthday later this year. I buy a Diet Coke and drink it while we walk around. In David Yurman, the salesperson asks me if the ring is on my wish list, and I tell him, \"Yes. My birthday wish list.\" B. then asks how much it costs ($675) and nods his head. I leave the store wondering if he will surprise me with it for my birthday? I would definitely have to stop dating other people after that...  $2.37 4:15 p.m. \u2014 As we are leaving the mall, I remember I have a client call scheduled for this afternoon. B. asks if he can bring his laundry over to my place (his building charges and I have in unit washer and dryer). He has to run a quick errand, so I stop and grab a drink while I take the client call. Then, I meet him back at his place to help him gather and load everything into his car.  $6.50 6 p.m. \u2014 Back at my place, B. sets up his computer to work for a bit and I get started on the laundry. My friends think it's weird that I wash his clothes for him, but it's an easy thing to do that he really appreciates. It's just not that big of a deal to me. Plus, this way I can discreetly toss out anything that I'm not a fan of. \"Oh, that Sean John t-shirt from 2004? No idea where it went, babe...\" Advertisement 8:15 p.m. \u2014 It's Taco Tuesday! B. and I head to Adelita's for $1 tacos, chips, guac, and margaritas. We split the tab. The couple sitting next to us tells us that the ice cream shop next door does $1 ice cream \"tacos\" as well (a waffle cone shaped into a taco shell), so of course we have to try them! I get peanut butter M&M and B. gets Oreo. He pays the $2 and I throw in a quarter for tax.  $24.25 10 p.m. \u2014 Back at my place, we agree we want to go out and decide on $2 bowling at Lucky Strike. I call an Uber to take us to 16th Street. At Lucky Strike, B. buys us a round of beers, loads money onto a game card, and we play Skee-Ball while we wait for a lane to open. I am the Skee-Ball queen and he has never beat me in the year we have been dating. When it's our turn to bowl, he pays for two games of bowling and shoe rental for both of us.  $4.62 11:30 p.m. \u2014 While we bowl, I order more beers and cheese curds, which turn out to be underwhelming and completely unnecessary. We run into some friends who are also bowling and all agree to hit one more bar before last call. We end up at Tarantula where B. pays for our beers and we play a few rounds of pool. Right as the bar is closing, I turn around and notice some dude has his pants down and is peeing right there on the floor! It's a Tuesday, man! Come on!  $30.17 Advertisement Daily Total: $99.66", "day_five": "Day Five: 1:30 a.m. \u2014 Last call is over and right as we head to leave, one of our friends tells the bouncer about floor peeing guy. The bouncer chases him down the street, puts him in a headlock, and drags him back into the bar to force him to clean it up. We take that as our cue to dip ASAP and jump in an Uber back to my place.  $6.88 7:45 a.m. \u2014 My alarm goes off and I make the executive decision to make today another work from home day. I go back to sleep for a few hours and when I wake up, I make us coffee and answer work emails in bed. 1 p.m. \u2014 We are both starving and B. wants breakfast food, so we drive to Original Pancake House for sustenance. I get the Denver omelet and orange juice. This week has been out of the ordinary for me with restaurant spending, and I realize I have spent a ridiculous amount of money. I take my leftovers home and vow to eat them for lunch tomorrow.  $21.46 2 p.m. \u2014 We swing by the store on the way back to my house for laundry detergent and coffee. I use my store's app for digital coupons and save $3 on the detergent.  $9.41 6 p.m. \u2014 I am going to a surprise birthday party downtown later tonight, so I decide to spend the night at B.'s since it is closer. Parking at his place in Capitol Hill is free after 6, and I Uber in gridlock traffic over the Speer Bridge into the Highlands. The party is a hit \u2014 the birthday boy is so surprised! We have drinks and snacks and sing lots of Ariana Grande.  $4.80 Advertisement 9 p.m. \u2014 I am trying to be good tonight since I have been such a party animal this week, so I say my goodbyes relatively early. If I didn't leave now, guaranteed I would go out with everyone to the gay bar and be out all night. I grab an Uber back to B.'s ($4.62) and snag a bottle of Malbec on my way ($11.80). At his place, we each have a glass of wine, heat up some of the banana bread in a bowl with ice cream, and share it while we Netflix and chill on the couch.  $16.42 11 p.m. \u2014 Wash my face and go to bed. Daily Total: $58.97", "day_six": "Day Six: 7 a.m. \u2014 Alarm goes off and I jump right out of bed, something that never happens. There is no traffic on the way back to my place which makes for a great start to my day. At home, I shower/coffee/hair/makeup per usual. I get a text from a family friend that I occasionally work catering gigs for. I decline the event she asks about, but make a mental note to pick up a few gigs before the holidays. I could easily take care of all my holiday shopping if I worked two events \u2014 the money is that good. 9:15 a.m. \u2014 I spend my morning preparing for a client call, and then an hour on the phone with them for our weekly status updates. I sneak in a granola bar from my desk for breakfast. The company I work for sponsors a scholarship at CU to try to recruit new hires, and the HR supervisor comes over to my desk to remind me that I am taking the winner out to lunch today. She offers me her corporate credit card which I appreciate. Now I don't have to submit an expense report! Advertisement 12 p.m. \u2014 I meet the scholarship winner and take him to lunch at a restaurant across the street from my office. Two coworkers from my department also join us. We get spinach artichoke dip for the table, and I order French onion soup and a French dip. The winner is a nice kid, but it's pretty clear he has no idea what insurance brokers actually do. When the check comes, I use the corporate card to pay.

I throw a load of laundry in the machine, pour a glass of wine, and smoke some weed while I watch  The Good Wife . I wanted to be an attorney when I was a little kid, and kind of still do... 8 p.m. \u2014 I pull together a dinner of frozen dumplings, random veggies, and a teriyaki sauce in my fridge. For dessert, I snack on chocolate chips and Insta-stalk B.'s ex-girlfriend, which sends me in a stoned haze down the social media rabbit hole. The girl is a teacher and the spelling errors in her posts are both comical and horrifying. 9:30 p.m. \u2014 I finally get a grip and put my phone down. I run the dishwasher, take out the trash, and do a little bit of work on my computer before I put on a face mask and head to bed. I sprawl out in my bed and watch  Seinfeld  reruns until I fall asleep.

Her boyfriend, whom she lives with and who basically bankrolls her life, broke up with her this morning and she's panicking. As I talk her off the ledge, I silently think to myself how happy I am that my finances aren't at the mercy of another individual. I did that once in my early twenties and learned the hard way to never allow it again. Her boyfriend's entire world revolves around the fact that he has the financial means to do essentially anything he wants \u2014 and he has no problem letting people know it. The man repulses me, quite honestly. 7:45 a.m. \u2014 Coffee and usual routine at home. 9:30 a.m. \u2014 Today is payday, and this will be the first check that reflects the 12% pay increase I received last week. I love my job, but I worked my ass off the past year and deserve every cent. It is nice to feel appreciated and validated at work; I have too many friends who do not have this experience. My salary is now approximately $65,000 and this check reflects the new wages plus approximately four months of retro-pay. The check total after tax, 401(k), insurance, etc. is $2,961. I multiply my regular check amount by 1.12 to find my increased check amount, and then transfer over the rest to my \"savings\" account which is really a slush fund. I need to get better about saving for emergencies, but at least retirement and health expenses are automatically deducted for me. Advertisement 11 a.m. \u2014 My work wife and I head to Torchy's Tacos for lunch. We snag two seats at the bar and order margaritas and tacos and vent to each other about pretty much everything. Work wife (WW) is a little bit older than me and has been with the company longer, so I truly value her input and perspective on things. She is intelligent and beautiful and I want to be her when I grow up. WW is married, but coaches me how she thinks I should handle things between B. and A. \u2014 ditch B. and pursue things with A. \u2014 which is exactly what every other friend of mine thinks.  $35.11 2 p.m. \u2014 I somehow accepted an invite for a carrier call on a Friday afternoon; not sure how that happened. I get an email from the engagement program of our health insurance notifying me that my health club subsidy has been processed and they are sending me a check for $177. You would never know it by my activities this week, but I do belong to (and use!) a gym, and my parents have paid the automatically renewing membership fee since I was in high school. 5:30 p.m. \u2014 After work, I head to the salon by my house to get my nails done. I have had busted nails for a few days now and I can't take it any longer. I get a fresh set of coffin shaped tips and I bring my own polish: OPI \"Meet Me on the Star Ferry.\" I went through a phase where I was obsessed with nail polish and I have a filing cabinet in my closet of about 40o polishes, so the selection at the salon never compares.  $38 Advertisement 7:30 p.m. \u2014 My dad calls and asks if I want to come over to my parents' house for dinner. Our golden retriever had surgery this week, so of course I want to see her! He picks me up on his way to the house and cooks us dinner while my mom and I drink wine, listen and sing to music, and just generally annoy him. I lied earlier this week: I have three good cooks in my life these days. 10 p.m. \u2014 After dinner, we start watching the new  Law & Order  series about the Menendez brothers. I get in an argument with B. over weekend plans and immediately set up a date with A. for tomorrow \u2014 a chili cook-off and beer tasting event. When the show is over, my dad insists on paying for an Uber to take me home. 10:30 p.m. \u2014 Finally home and I crash.

I hunker down for a few hours of work. Advertisement 12:30 p.m. \u2014 The morning went by fast! I love having consistent work and projects to do because my last job was pretty much the opposite and every day dragged on forever. I take a break for lunch and remember I need to order one last Christmas gift for my friend. I'm doing a \"self-care\" package for her, including her favorite nail polish and blooming tea.

We make plans to go to dinner tonight. 6 p.m. \u2014 I meet my mom at Barcelona, a tapas and wine bar, for dinner. It's one of my favorites! We get a cheese and charcuterie board, and of course some tapas: patatas bravas, roasted cauliflower, and bacon wrapped dates. I offer to pay, but my mom insists on covering the bill because she's an angel. 9 p.m. \u2014 I drive home and stop for gas along the way.

My relatively low rent is one of the reasons I decided to stay in my college town after graduation. These days, living alone in a one-bedroom apartment for the amount I'm paying is a tall order in the Bay, and I'd be hard pressed to replicate it.

My parents have generously let me stay on their plan, and in return I share my  NYT ,  WaPo ,  The New Yorker , and Amazon Prime subscriptions with them.

Company-offered program where employees can purchase company stock at a discount. Savings:  $400. Have no specific goals for the funds yet, but grad school and/or owning property could be neat at some point. I have $9,000 in savings, $35,000 in retirement, and $33,000 in investments.

Berkeley itself was okay, but the air quality was so poor here that I, and many others, turned to respirator masks to get relief from the throat irritation and coughing. The news says the fires in SoCal are so massive we can expect air quality up here to suffer once more. It's scary and saddening to see the effects of climate change play out in such a stark and destructive manner.

He asked me to buy one for him, and he'll pay me back; electronics like these are much more expensive and difficult to get there.

This cousin in question has a friend in Berkeley who will be returning to the motherland in a few days, and can take it with him to deliver.  $115 3 p.m. \u2014 Realize that I'm getting hungry, and reheat the leftover salmon I made last night \u2014broiled with dill, butter, and garlic, with steamed zucchini on the side \u2014 for a late lunch. 5 p.m. \u2014 Log off work for the day. Here's hoping I can start my project soon. One can only browse so much news before one's grip on reality becomes tenuous. 6:30 p.m. \u2014 Leave my apartment and head for BART, which I'll charge to my pre-loaded Clipper card. I'm meeting friends in San Francisco to watch  Lady Bird , which I've been wanting to see for weeks now. I love Greta Gerwig and coming-of-age movies, so I'm looking forward to it. 7:30 p.m. \u2014 Get to the theater right as the trailers start. I quickly purchase my ticket and locate my friends. Thankfully, it's a weeknight so it's not too crowded and we're able to find a group of decent seats together.  $13 Advertisement 9:30 p.m. \u2014  Lady Bird  was lovely. I really empathized with Lady Bird's complex and often fraught relationship with her mom; it reminded me of my senior year in high school. We discuss the film for a bit before splitting up; it is a weeknight, after all, and we all have work tomorrow. I try to avoid taking BART alone at night, so call an Uber Pool.  $10.89 10:30 p.m. \u2014 Get back home and am a little peckish, but not enough to cook a real meal. Settle on toast with PB&J.

I got LASIK done last year, and while the pros far outweigh the cons, the chronic dry eyes \u2014 especially with my large amount of screen time \u2014 are real. 11 a.m. \u2014 Still no sign of movement on the project onboarding. It's more than a little frustrating. While checking my email, I get a notice from a popular event organizer in the Bay \u2014 Rep. Adam Schiff, D-CA, is coming to speak in San Francisco in February! I am a fan of the Congressman and admire his bravery and tenacity, so getting a ticket is a no-brainer.  $23.16 12 p.m. \u2014 Mega-cringe for the day: I check in to see how Alabama's senatorial election is going because I'm a masochist, and can only cringe at the latest ridiculous, potentially bigoted statements emanating from Roy Moore's camp. I have zero idea what's happening in America these days, or where these people are coming from. It's like a massive  SNL  parody that was rejected for being too on-the-nose has become our reality. Advertisement 2 p.m. \u2014 Lunch is a slightly haphazard affair of whatever leftovers I can find in my fridge. I desperately need groceries. I come up with leftover Chinese, and supplement it with steamed veggies on the side. I am a domestic goddess. 5:30 p.m. \u2014 Head for Trader Joe's, determined to have a less pathetic dinner. Buy milk, eggs, olive oil, turkey bacon, tuna steaks, a salmon fillet, Havarti cheese, sweet potatoes, brussels sprouts, zucchini, penne pasta, marinara sauce, mushrooms, an eggplant, buttermilk, shrimp, chicken pot stickers, garlic naan, a single-serve palak paneer meal (no judgement zone), and a bar of dark chocolate.  $67.73 7:30 p.m. \u2014 Whip out my cast-iron pan and make seared tuna steaks, with roasted brussels sprouts and baked sweet potato fries on the side. It turns out pretty well, and I feel I've mostly redeemed myself. 8 p.m. \u2014 Holy hell, Doug Jones won. Well done, Alabama. I donated to his campaign last month, but even then thought his to be a quixotic last stand. I've never been so happy to be wrong. I donate $20 to the NAACP in celebration; they were instrumental in getting out the vote.

Look at me, spreading my wings. 9 a.m. \u2014 Start the day with a call: FedEx is outside with the iPhone X I ordered last week. It's not for me, though, but for another cousin in Pakistan. This is obviously a bigger-ticket item than the Kindle, but this cousin and I are quite close and I don't mind doing her a solid. (My iPhone 6 is still chugging along.) Advertisement 11 a.m. \u2014 A sigh of relief: I receive word from HR and my manager that I'm finally cleared to start the project! I'll be starting at the client site on Monday. Hallelujah. While I am definitely a homebody, even I've started to go stir-crazy. This is very welcome news. 1 p.m. \u2014 Polish off the other tuna steak and the rest of the sweet potato fries (which I could honestly eat forever, they are SO GOOD) for lunch. Realize with some alarm that I've also somehow worked my way through a quarter of the dark chocolate bar already. I move it to a different counter. 2 p.m. \u2014 Post lunch, check my email to see I've gotten a flurry of emails from various members of the team I'll be joining. Even though I start Monday, there's always an expectation in consulting that you'll hit the ground running as soon as you start, so you don't waste the client's time and money. The emails make it clear there is no shortage of demos, overviews of applications I'll be working with and testing, and workflow charts I can start going through. I'll be working in the healthcare space, and though I've done other projects in this industry, I have not performed this specific role. This is gonna be interesting. Here we go. 5 p.m. \u2014 After work and already feeling the effects of information overload from the sheer number of PowerPoint presentations I have to look through. I swing by the UPS store, where an Amazon package was dropped off for me. Grab a latte on the way back.  $3.30 Advertisement 6:30 p.m. \u2014 Spend some time looking over my cryptocurrency holdings. I've been interested in crypto since I took a course on block chain technology in college, and about a year ago, I bought small amounts of a few cryptocurrencies out of interest in the projects. I've seen some gains since then, but nothing matches Bitcoin's explosive growth in the last month alone: On November 1, it hovered around $6,000 a coin. At time of writing this, it is around $17,000 a coin. That kind of growth is obviously unprecedented \u2014 and totally irrational. I can only ascribe this parabolic growth to the sudden spike in societal awareness of crypto in general and Bitcoin in particular. I worry that people who don't appreciate how high-risk crypto is are investing irresponsible amounts of money in it, in the hopes of getting rich quick. The cardinal rule of cryptocurrency is to never invest more than you can afford to lose, and I fear we're headed for a crash that will have ugly consequences for many. 9 p.m. \u2014 Watch an episode of  Godless  on Netflix. I love Michelle Dockery so I thought I'd give it a try, but it's not doing much for me. After, I suffer through a round of HIIT on FitnessBlender. I don't know whose idea mountain climbers were, but I'd like to write them a strongly-worded letter. Daily Total: $3.30", "day_four": "Day Four: 9 a.m. \u2014 Out the door to meet my cousin's friend. (The one returning to Pakistan, who is delivering the Kindle and iPhone.) My familial duties are complete. The kid looks a bit frazzled; it's finals week, apparently, and he doesn't look like he has slept in a while. I certainly don't miss those days. Get a bagel at Noah's on the way back; the cashier surprises me by giving it to me on the house. Nice start to the day! Advertisement 11 a.m. \u2014 More introductory materials to go through. These demos are loooong. Wondering why knowledge transfer via osmosis isn't a thing yet. 1 p.m. \u2014 Fry some chicken pot stickers with a side of steamed zucchini for lunch. Read up on the FCC's vote to repeal net neutrality for a bit before closing my internet browser in disgust. (Take that, ISPs!) This is why we can't have nice things, y'all. My periodic desire to shun society and take up life as a nomad living out of a yurt somewhere flares up. 2 p.m. \u2014 Beat down escapist fantasies and open another PowerPoint. I'd make a terrible goatherd, anyway. 5:30 p.m. \u2014 After logging off for the day, I make penne for dinner with marinara sauce, ground beef, eggplant, mushroom, and plenty of spices. Listen to the new episode of  Pod Save America  as I cook. I saw them live last week and they were great; very personable and witty. 7 p.m. \u2014 Chat on the phone with my mom for a bit; she's pleased that I'm finally starting my project, and we then move on to the major subject at hand. My brother's getting married next month, and South Asian weddings are crazy, probably over-the-top, multi-day, loud, colorful, family affairs, with tons of food, choreographed Bollywood-style dancing. I'll be desperately trying to remain upright in a sari without accidentally ripping the whole thing off due to misplaced steps. My mom's been in planning mode for months, and though it's been a logistical nightmare, I'm looking forward to the actual event.

I pour my tea into a thermos and eat my toast on the go as I head to BART. 10 a.m. \u2014 The office is pretty busy since most consultants don't work at their client sites on Fridays. My assigned space turns out to be in a slightly cramped room shared with two guys on a very loud conference call. Yay. 12 p.m. \u2014 Escape the room at lunch, going to my favorite halal food truck and buying a gyro rice plate. Probably unhealthy, but I love it too much. It's a nice day in SF so I go for a walk through the Financial District after eating.  $10 1:30 p.m. \u2014 Get a very welcome email: Thanks to the work survey I took last week, I've won a ticket to see the Warriors play the Grizzlies next week! My firm works with the Warriors so we get opportunities like this on occasion. My number one team will always be the Rockets (11 straight wins, baby!) but with six years in the Bay, I've adopted the Dubs as a secondary team. They're always fun to watch. 6:30 p.m. \u2014 Meet my friends at the movie theater. We have tickets for  The Last Jedi , and as I'm very serious about my  Star Wars , I insisted we all get here early to secure good seats. I refuse to be stuck in the front row while Rey struggles with the dark side. My friend purchased our tickets online yesterday, so I Venmo him as we walk in. Now, time to enter a galaxy far, far away\u2026  $15.69 Advertisement 10 p.m. \u2014 Omg. That was so good. I am, as the kids say, shook. No spoilers, but fans of the franchise should be pleased.  Rogue One  was amazing but I was a little disappointed by  The Force Awakens  as I thought the plot was too similar to  A New Hope . There's no fear of that here. Also, it was long and I'm now starving. Aside from nightlife, SF kind of shuts down after 10 p.m., but there are a few bars with dinner menus, so we Uber to one (my friend pays). After battling our way to a table, we finally eat. I get a cheeseburger, which is delicious, and we split a slice of cake.  $23 12 a.m. \u2014 My friends want to go barhopping, and though I don't drink, I usually accompany them to the first few spots because it's fun to hang out. Everywhere is crowded, so conversation is limited, but we finally end up in a pub with a free table and post up for a bit. 1:30 a.m. \u2014 I'm dead and call it quits. BART tragically closes at midnight, so I split an Uber back to Berkeley with a friend who also lives here. It's still crazy expensive, but prices surge after midnight and pretty much stay there until at least 3 a.m. I get home around 2 a.m. and happily crawl into bed.  $17 Daily Total: $65.69", "day_six": "Day Six: 10:30 a.m. \u2014 Sleep in with zero guilt, and consider sleeping more even after my alarm goes off. Alas, I have plans to go hiking with friends and one is already en route to pick me up. I bid a sad farewell to my bed, get myself together, and inhale toast and tea by the time she arrives. Advertisement 11:15 a.m. \u2014 We stop by Ike's, a popular Bay Area sandwich chain, to grab rations. I get a M\u00e9nage \u00e0 Trois on Dutch Crunch (they go for zany names). It's my Ike's go-to and is named for its three cheeses (cheddar, pepper jack, and Swiss) and three sauces (barbecue, honey mustard, and honey) paired with chicken and lettuce. It's delicious. I cover my friends' food as well, since they're doing all the driving.  $34.06 1 p.m. \u2014 After picking up our other friend, we make our way up to Point Reyes National Seashore up in Marin where we'll be hiking. It's beautiful up here and has a huge variety of great trails, many along the coast. One of my favorite things about the Bay is its easy access to nature. Since we arrived relatively late in the day, with not too many hours of sunlight left, we pick a moderate five-mile hike. 3 p.m. \u2014 Inhale our sandwiches at our stopping point, a beautiful vista overlooking the Pacific. Attempt several hilarious backlit selfies. 5:30 p.m. \u2014 We return to the parking lot just as it starts to get dark. I am so over daylight savings and winter; it's pitch black by 6 p.m. and makes me want to stay in bed watching Netflix. It was a great hike, though, and I resolve to do this more often. (I'm also embarrassingly sore, so eventually my legs will approve of this choice.) 6:30 p.m. \u2014 On our way back, we stop at a coffee shop, in desperate need of caffeine. It's attached to a little vintage store and I flip through their collection of used records, coming across a vinyl of  Ella Fitzgerald Sings the Duke Ellington Songbook . I don't think twice about buying it; my dad is a huge jazz fan, and I grew up listening to Ella, Louis Armstrong, Miles Davis, Dave Brubeck, etc. on his record player. This will be a nice surprise for him when I go home for the holidays! Meanwhile, my friend covers our coffee.  $13.02 Advertisement 7:30 p.m. \u2014 Finally get back to Berkeley; my friend kindly drops me off.

Looking forward to a lazy Sunday, especially with my project starting Monday! 11:30 a.m. \u2014 In the kitchen, I whip up chocolate-chip buttermilk pancakes, my monthly tradition. They take a little while but are so worth it; breakfast is my favorite meal of the day. Have a pancake with turkey bacon on the side and tea. 1 p.m. \u2014 I didn't get through all the materials I need to look at for Monday, and since I don't want to embarrass myself, I dedicate the afternoon to getting up to speed. 4 p.m. \u2014 Finally set my work laptop aside. There's only so much you can absorb, and the best learning comes from doing, so Monday will be a bit of a crash-course anyway. Have some of the pasta I made earlier in the week. 4:30 p.m. \u2014 Wanting to stretch my legs a little, I go for a walk through the UC Berkeley campus, which is gorgeous and abandoned. The students gone for winter break and I make my way into downtown Berkeley before turning around. While I like SF, I think I prefer the smaller-town vibe Berkeley has. It also smells a lot better than the city, which assaults you with a barrage of odors every time you walk out of a BART station.

I feel like a tornado, running around getting ready and packing my things, but it's worth the extra sleep. Advertisement 8:15 a.m. \u2014 I get to work just in time and make oatmeal in the kitchen.

I walk to the Subway close to my office for a meatball marinara; they're only $2 this month! Unfortunately, they are out of meatballs, so I get a cold-cut combo for the same price.

I already ate, but I'll keep this in the fridge for future lunches. I usually get a salad base at Chipotle, but they're out of salad. Secretly, I'm not too upset and ask to pile on rice. My coworker pays since I paid last time we split. 2 p.m. \u2014 My company's Christmas party is this Saturday and we get to invite plus ones. I'm as single as can be, so I've asked my guy BFF to come with me, as I know he'll be great company. I want to get him a tie to match my dress as a \"Thanks for coming\" Christmas gift.

I also get a pair of leggings for myself.  $52 Advertisement 4:45 p.m. \u2014 I sneak out of work a little early to make it to a yoga class I really like. It starts at 5, and according to my calculations, 17 minutes is the exact amount of time I need to get to my car, drive to the studio, park, change into workout clothes, and set up my mat. I finish the class as a sweaty mess and head home. 7:30 p.m. \u2014 I shower and get ready to meet some of my girlfriends. We're going to River Oaks to see the multimillion dollar houses all lit up for Christmas. I fry some eggs and eat them quickly to avoid spending money later in the evening. One of the friends I'm meeting works at a shoe store and bought a pair of shoes for me with her discount. The shoes are $30, but I only have $10 in cash. I take a $20 bill from my mom to give to my friend.  $10 9 p.m. \u2014 The lights are gorgeous! I dream of owning a home in this ZIP code one day. We go to a hookah bar after to eat and smoke shisha.

(Or at least a small piece isn't.) But I'm too busy finishing things before the luncheon to eat anything else. 12 p.m. \u2014 The luncheon is great! I grab chicken piccata, ravioli, bread, and salad. I'm disappointed in the dessert though; it's cheesecake, but tastes frozen. I eat one bite and leave the rest. 2 p.m. \u2014 A client delivers cupcakes from one of my favorite bakeries to the office! I eat a chocolate one at my desk. 5 p.m. \u2014 I leave work and head to a 5:30 p.m. flow class.

I kick myself for not ordering it earlier. Advertisement 8 p.m. \u2014 On my way home, my mom calls and asks me to pick up a tray of biriyani and to withdraw $70 to pay for it. She tells me the place is close to home, but when I look it up, it's 10 miles away! I'm already annoyed at having to deal with this after the tie mishap, and when I get to the ATM, I have to withdraw in increments of $20. When I pick the food up, it turns out the total is only $60. I head home and eat a little of the biryani. It's too oily and spicy for my liking, plus I'm not that hungry after my heavy lunch. My mom gives me $70 later, but I only take $40 since the dish was $60 and I took money from her yesterday to buy my shoes. She would never ask me to pay her back, but I'm trying to get out of my high school and college ways and be an adult. Normally, I wouldn't take any money back from her at all for something like this, but this month is tough with gifts and holiday stuff, so I accept. 10:30 p.m. \u2014 I've become a bit of a grandma since I started working.

I'm also due for a pedicure, but my dad accidentally charged $250 to my card on Amazon and I'm trying to be mindful of my expenses to offset that. I contemplate paying with cash I have from earlier, but since I asked Shoe Friend to order two more pairs for me with her discount, I save it for when I'll need to pay her back.  $14 5:15 p.m. \u2014 This is turning out to be an expensive day!

I am so annoyed; flaking is my biggest pet peeve. I vow to never make plans with them again \u2014 some people aren't worth bending over backwards for.

The sales associates says it isn't worth hunting down at this location, though, and suggest that I go to their Woodlands location 60 miles away, where there are four left. I plead to St. Anthony as I search through the tie racks. I find a few good backups, but not the one I want. Being my usual stubborn self, I decide to put them back in the tie section where they belong, and I find the last tie!

As I leave the restaurant, one of my besties texts to say she saw my Snapchat at the restaurant and is at a hookah bar down the street! I'm beyond tired, but she's leaving to visit family tomorrow and I won't see her until the new year, so I go and hang out for about an hour. When the check comes, I offer to pitch in with the other four girls even though I was late and barely smoked. They're still students, and it's just a few bucks. No big deal.  $6 1:30 a.m. \u2014 Finally home! I wash off my makeup and do a quick brightening treatment before jumping into bed. I don't want my skin to look dull after this long day. Thank god tomorrow is Friday and traffic won't be so bad. According to my calculations, I can afford to sleep in until 7:15, as opposed to my usual 7. Small mercies.

I leisurely eat my oatmeal and read the news at my desk. 11:15 a.m. \u2014 I usually bring lunch from home every day, but this week has been an unusual one with tons of free food. I decide to continue the trend of eating outside food and get a meatball marinara from Subway. I usually eat closer to 1, but I haven't replenished my stock of office snacks, since doing so seemed pointless with the holidays right around the corner.  $2 Advertisement 12:30 p.m. \u2014 I take my lunch break and pick up my jacket, which I thoughtlessly left behind last night. After, I have about 20 minutes left on my break, so I take a quick nap in my car. It's probably not the best habit, but sometimes when I'm really tired, I'll take a power nap in the garage. A year ago, I could go out all night and still function normally at work. Now, going to sleep after midnight turns me into a zombie the next day. 5 p.m. \u2014 I wanted to leave work a little early to have time to get ready for the evening, but my boss needs me to take care of something at half-past 4. When I finish, I leave the office and go to the salon for my waxing appointment. 6:30 p.m. \u2014 I started coming to this salon when they first opened and used an introductory Groupon. The owner continued to give me the Groupon rate even after the promotion ended, so I get my arms, legs, and Brazilian done for just $65 \u2014 including tip. I go home to shower off the stickiness and help my parents put up more Christmas decorations before I get ready.  $65 9 p.m. \u2014 My girlfriend picks me up and we leave for her company Christmas party. She works at a Big Four firm, and their party is a grand affair with 3,000 people. They rent out the entire Museum of Natural Science, and there's a lot of booze, snacks, and exhibits to look at. A group of us have a blast taking pictures and indulging. Advertisement 12:30 a.m. \u2014 After the party, we go out for dessert to The Chocolate Bar. I try to pay, but my \"date\" and our other friend insist I'm their guest and pay for the ice creams and milkshakes. On the way out, I buy a box of chocolate covered strawberries for my mom to offer the guests she's having over this weekend. Boxes are half-off after 8 p.m., so it's a good deal.  $5 1:45 a.m. \u2014 Finally home! I take off my makeup and fall asleep right away.

Joke's on me though: Even though I woke up early, I only get to the studio right as class starts and don't have time to fill my water bottle. I always think it's so wasteful when other people spend money on water at gyms, but here I am in the same situation! My shoes are $2 and so is the water bottle.  $4 12 p.m. \u2014 One of my best friends and I grab lunch at our favorite Thai place. I remember to bring my metal straws and we both drink water and get red curry. When the check comes, we both argue about who will pick it up and settle on splitting. This friend and I frequently pay for each other and never worry about paying the other back; it always comes out even in the end.  $13 Advertisement 1:30 p.m. \u2014 I get home, prep my skin with a sheet mask, and then start straightening my hair. I can't believe my Christmas party is tonight! The cleaning lady is here, so I put away my laundry and tidy up a bit so she can vacuum the floor. 4 p.m. \u2014 I go to a friend's house to have her do my makeup. I swear, she could be a real makeup artist. She does a brown and gold smoky eye with nude lips that goes well with my dress. 5:20 p.m. \u2014 Of course, I end up running late. I meet my friend at Kroger. We try to buy balloons, but it takes too long. I keep calm and call Party City to place an order for immediate pick up. 5:45 p.m. \u2014 I finally have my ball0ons! I'm running VERY late, as I wanted to arrive by 5:45 to set everything up (the event starts at 6:15), but looks like I'll be right on time instead. I hope no one is there yet. ($17, expensed) 6:10 p.m. \u2014 Ah \u2014 people are already there! I run in with my hands full of balloons and table decorations. I ignore everyone's offers to help and have my friend set up things on one end of the table, while I do the other side. I scatter the balloons around as much as I can before the rest of the guests arrive. 6:45 p.m. \u2014 Finally, I start to relax. People are in love with the setup and I'm already getting compliments about the venue and food choices. Advertisement 7:30 p.m. \u2014 I arranged to have a wine tasting before dinner. Everyone gets an individual charcuterie plate and wine flight, and they're very impressed! We have dinner from a pre-fixe menu; I order the caprese salad, short rib and mashed potatoes, and for dessert, we all have French truffles with prosecco. 10:30 p.m. \u2014 I talk with the staff and get the check to my boss, who pays for the evening. They made a mistake initially and I caught it, despite being tipsy. I wish my boss knew that! He seems super happy with everything, so I leave the venue feeling great. My friend and I consider going to Discovery Green to see the lights, but we decided it's too cold and he drives me home instead. 11:30 p.m. \u2014 I go home and sadly wash off my makeup. Wish I could keep it on forever! I jump into bed and fall asleep right away.

I see blueberries on sale so I grab two cartons. I'll have to remember to take them to work with me tomorrow.  $10 1:30 p.m. \u2014 Dad gets nervous about us running out of beer, and sends me out again. I still get a thrill out of buying alcohol and showing my ID, even though I've been 21 for a while now. I did not realize beer was so expensive. I get a 12-pack of Stella and head home.  $18 Advertisement 4:45 p.m. \u2014 The party went well! A lot of our guests leave to go to church or get started on the week ahead. My family and I head to church, too. 7 p.m. \u2014 There were only nine strawberries in the box I got yesterday so my mom didn't put them out. I eat a few before showering and doing a deep-cleaning skincare routine to compensate for all the makeup and lack of sleep I've put my skin through this weekend. 10:30 p.m. \u2014 I pack clothes to change into tomorrow (after work, I'm going to a Rockets game) and remind myself to withdraw money at lunch to pay my friend back for my ticket. After such a hectic weekend of back to back-to-back parties and outings, I'm pooped. I watch a little Netflix while my essential oil diffuser is on, and fall asleep, dreaming of the PTO I have planned in the weeks ahead.

I down a bottle of cold water while making a piece of avocado toast and a piece of jam toast. Trader Joe's coffee brews while I eat. (Their Winter Spice Blend is to die for.) 12 p.m. \u2014 I skip the company tradition of Thai food to go to Wegmans with my coworker for hummus. We both realize we've never been to Wegmans before, and wander around in awe of its magic. There's an entire vegan aisle. (I'm mostly vegan \u2014 not careful enough at restaurants to be full-on vegan \u2014 but I am strict vegetarian!) And there's an aisle where you can make your own trail mix! I'm already in love. I buy two tubs of hummus, a two-pound bag of carrots, pretzel chips, and raspberries. When I get back, I dip some of the chips and carrots into the hummus for lunch. I also munch on blackberries from home.  $15.15 Advertisement 2 p.m. \u2014 I run to Starbucks with my manager; we go two or three times a week. It's a good chance for me to have one-on-ones with him and learn more about the company. He recently became addicted to peppermint mochas despite saying he hates coffee, so I feel like this is a big win for me. The total is $2.39 for a grande Pike Place roast, but I have a preloaded card with gift card cash. 5:30 p.m. \u2014 On the drive home, I need to stop and get gas. I have a pretty economical Honda that I love, and filling up the tank cost will probably last between one and a half to two weeks.  $19.28 6:45 p.m. \u2014 I get home from the drive. I commute to D.C. one or two times each week but my company pays for the E\u2011ZPass, so I don't mind it. I work a bit more while making dinner, a veggie burger on toast with corn and beets on the side. For the rest of the night, I work on freelance projects, schedule emails, and plan my Christmas gift shopping (to be done on Friday \u2014 also known as payday). Daily Total: $34.43", "day_two": "Day Two: 8 a.m. \u2014 Got a late start this morning. First thing I do after getting ready for the day is drink a full water bottle. Mine holds 750 mL, and I usually try to drink at least three liters a day. For breakfast, I eat avocado toast and jam toast again, and brew coffee, which I'll bring to work in mason jar (inevitably burning myself during the drive). Every day, I think about buying a to-go mug, but here I am after two months, still spilling coffee on my commute. Advertisement 12 p.m. \u2014 Lunch time! My lazy, running-late lunch is hummus from Wegmans and a bag of baby carrots with whatever fruit I remember to bring. I drink two more bottles of water by the end of lunch and log my intake into an app, since I'm trying to save my skin from winter. 5 p.m. \u2014 One of my coworkers leaves to buy chips at Subway. I don't want to spend money, but chips sound so good. I solemnly drink tea at my desk thinking about chips. 6 p.m. \u2014 I drive home and start working on freelance projects. I don't do them very often, but this one was too awesome to say no to, and the additional money never hurts. I hoped to make it to the gym if I finished in time, but that seems unlikely. I make dinner for the night at home, roasted sweet potato, black beans, corn, beets and salsa. I also made a serving for lunch, adding in quinoa and snap peas. I'm trying to keep my spending low during the week since I have to buy Christmas presents this weekend and take my car to the shop for an oil change. My December bonus is attached to this Friday's paycheck so it'll give me a bit of wiggle room, even though I plan to add most of it to savings. Daily Total: $0", "day_three": "Day Three: 6:30 a.m. \u2014 This morning sucks. It's cold and dark and rainy. I walk around with blankets wrapped around me while brushing my teeth and checking Tinder. I stare at my goldfish for a while with bleary eyes and sip on the water. None of my avocados are ripe, so this morning's toast is all raspberry jam. I'm really starting to get sick of toast but I ran out of oatmeal earlier this week, which I is my usual alternate for breakfast. I get freelance work done in the morning, which is quiet and filled with coffee, and send emails from home. Advertisement 12 p.m. \u2014 Lunch time. All my coworkers love eating lunch exactly at noon for some reason. I heat up my lunch from home and join them. Even though I forgot to add mango salsa to my lunch, it's extremely spicy, so I chug water at the speed of light, also throwing ice cubes in my mason jar of coffee. I spend the second part of lunch trying to figure out what maintenance my cars needs since it's close to 100,000 miles, internally hating owning a car and being an adult. 4 p.m. \u2014 Our co-working space is having a holiday party today, which means free food and booze. I graze on the vegetable plate while drinking a Corona. Initially, I grabbed spanakopita and a veggie sandwich too, but in an unfortunate chain of events, I realized the sandwich labeled vegetarian was actually turkey and had to throw it. out. I chat with my coworkers and eventually pop out, taking some of the free food home in my container from lunch. 8 p.m. \u2014 I sip on egg nog, eat the spanakopita I brought home, and watch a bit of TV before getting started on freelance work. The person I'm doing freelance work for calls and we have a good discussion about timelines. Looks like I'll make it to the gym tomorrow! It starts snowing outside, which I am  not  about.

Didn't have time to make any breakfast or coffee beforehand, but I drink the office coffee and later have a packet of instant oatmeal my coworker/best friend brought me after I complained about all the toast. Advertisement 10:30 a.m. \u2014 I leave work to pick up my manager from the airport. The airport is only a seven-minute drive from our office so we usually leave our cars at the office building. He buys me Starbucks in exchange for the ride, so I happily sip my mocha on the way back to work. 1 p.m. \u2014 I had a presentation at noon with West Coast clients so I missed lunch. They loved what I presented though, and my manager picked up a hummus snack cup from Wawa for me when he grabbed lunch.  $3.73 6 p.m. \u2014 I've been working on our website redesign and still have a ton of work to do, but I want to head home to go on a run and refresh my mind. I drive home, curse at traffic, go on a long run, and then make a sandwich. During my run, I had a moment of clarity with how I want the new website to look, and I try to get it on paper. My roommate and I have  Assassin's Creed  on in the background, and he seems to think it's awesome. I couldn't even tell you what happened. By the time the movie is over, it's after 10.

(One of my coworkers brings in bagels for everyone on Fridays.) My coworker drove us in today and we get to work by 8:15 a.m. I drink the office coffee, munch on my bagel ($3), and meet with my team about the concept I came up with last night. They love it and we spend the first half of the day trying to prove the concept and iterating on it. When we present it before noon, my CEO loves it, too.  $3 Advertisement 12 p.m. \u2014 Since my coworker and I both got our paychecks and bonuses today, we decide to treat ourselves to lunch. We go to a hipster place that sells artisan jam because that's a thing now. My vegetarian banh mi and cup of butternut squash soup are amazing ($11.41). Would literally cry into my food if it was appropriate. I treat myself to an eggnog latte afterwards as well, because I haven't spent much money all week and am really excited about eggnog season. ($3.50)  $14.91 6 p.m. \u2014 The rest of the day is pretty normal. My team works on illustrations we need for the new website concept. We have a meeting at 5 p.m. with a West Coast client that runs past 6 p.m. When we finally leave, traffic is terrible and there are about four inches of snow outside. While the snow is pretty, scraping the ice off of the car is hellish. 6:20 p.m. \u2014 During the ride home, I get terrifying text from one of my roommates, J. Our house was broken into this morning after we all left for work. He came home and saw the backdoor had been kicked through. They literally kicked through a fucking deadbolt in broad daylight. I'm stuck in traffic for another 20 minutes and anxious about how bad it will be. J. said the house was trashed. 6:40 p.m. \u2014 I get home and there's a cop sitting on my couch, cataloguing everything that was stolen. Honestly, at this point, I really just want to check on my goldfish. Ironically, they're the things I care the most about even though I won them by accident at a state fair for two bucks over the summer. (I thought the prize was a stuffed animal, but I went home with four goldfish.) I hightail it upstairs to check on them, and they're fine! I start breathing easier, although the rest of my room is in shambles. They left my computer, which was in plain sight on my desk, but they took my iPad, which was in a case in my bookshelf?? They took a fake pair of pearl earrings, too. I tell the officer what was taken, and check on my roommates' rooms. J. is the only other one home for tonight. Advertisement 7:45 p.m. \u2014 The police officer leaves, and J. and I try to figure out what to do with the backdoor since the lock is broken and the doorframe is falling apart. We end up drilling planks of heavy wood over the door to blockade it. Then, we clean up our roommates' rooms a bit before going to clean our own. I put everything I own in the washer because my stuff was thrown everywhere. 8:50 p.m. \u2014 After cleaning, J. and I settle in to watch a movie and drink wine. I realize I haven't had dinner yet, and since I just got fucking robbed, I order my fave food off Uber Eats. Take that robbers. My chilaquiles ($17.12) are expensive, but whatever \u2014 they're good and I deserve it.  I've already done the math and realize what was stolen is less than my deductible, so I cut my losses. My roommates weren't as lucky and lost some pretty expensive stuff. Two of my roommates who split renter's insurance accidentally wrote the address wrong, and have been insuring the pizza place down the street. Darkly humorous, but also so shitty. We watch movies for the rest of the night, drink, and smoke. It's chill. We're not in the mood for much else.  $17.12 Daily Total: $35.03", "day_six": "Day Six: 7:30 a.m. \u2014 I'm wide awake and am not falling back asleep. I had multiple break-in nightmares that would easily work for a horror movie. In one, the robber was still in our house, sneaking around, stealing our phones when we weren't looking, and then murdering us one by one. So, yeah. Didn't sleep much and don't plan on going to go back to sleep. Advertisement 8:30 a.m. \u2014 I hear someone moving downstairs and see a text from J. that the landlord is here with maintenance to fix the door. They're taking apart our handy work first, which they were surprised to see. Who wouldn't board up a broken door in Baltimore?! I make coffee and toast, while my landlord is wears sunglasses and complains about being hungover. It's too early to deal with this, so I go upstairs to take care of my house plants, which need their showers. I have a couple of big ones so it's easier to put them in my shower to water them instead of using a watering can. 12 p.m. \u2014 Maintenance finally leaves and I'm off to Target with my friend. I'm spending a little bit of my bonus on new skincare items. My sister started doing the double wash method and has been raving about it, so I'm going to try it, too. I buy the Pixi Double Cleanse face wash ($24), and a variety pack that includes their toner because they're out of the large bottles. The tester has two mud masks and tonic toner in it, too ($22). I also grab a pack of washcloths for my face so I can use a fresh one every two days ($3.99). I use my bonus money on this instead of my regular budget.  $49.99 12:45 p.m. \u2014 After target, we stop in Harris Teeter to buy groceries for the week. I get raspberries, Tofurkey, corn, peas, black beans, bananas, bread, one frozen entree, avocados, hummus, and coffee for $39.87. It'll be enough to make it for the rest of the week. We're pretty hungry and stop in Chick-fil-A next door for a quick snack. I get medium fries and sweet tea ($3.55). It's pretty clutch.  $43.42 Advertisement 3 p.m. \u2014 To wrap up the shopping trip, we drop into the liquor store. I made a bottle opener a week ago in a blacksmith class and haven't had any bottled beer to try it on. I text J., who also did the class, and asks if he wants to split. We decide to get a variety pack of Sierra Nevada because we have different beer preferences ($21.50 total split two ways). I also pick up a bottle of wine to split with my other roommate, which costs $7.45 after being split two ways.  $18.20 5 p.m. \u2014 I get home and J. really wants sushi. I'm down, so we take some of the beers we just bought to a BYOB sushi place. It's awesome. I get two avocado rolls and miso soup for only $11 after tax and tip.  $11 7 p.m. \u2014 Friends come over and we play poker and pregame for holiday parties we're going to later. One is fancy one, the other is ugly-sweater themed, so J. and I wear my two ugly Christmas cat sweaters with his suit jackets on top and bowties. I've got a black skirt and tights on, and he wears nice slacks. It's hilarious and we run with it. We drink beer, play games, and eventually head out. 11 p.m. \u2014 The second party runs out of alcohol and my friend wants to grab some from the liquor store down the street. I tag along; it's almost 11 so the liquor store closes in an hour, and I figure I can have one more beer. I grab a Modelo Tallboy for myself and another for J., which he pays me back for. Economical, and will take me a while to drink. When I get back to the party, it seems a lot of people know we were robbed and keep asking about it. I'm kinda over it and just stick with some of my good friends. Around 1 a.m., I head home with friends, snack on a little hummus, drink a lot of water, and go to bed.  $3.45 Advertisement Daily Total: $126.06", "day_seven": "Day Seven: 10 a.m. \u2014 I wake up with a slight headache and put away the last load of laundry while drinking water. Around 10 a.m., I head to a coffee shop to focus on work for the rest of the day. I order black coffee and spinach and feta wrap, deciding this is the last thing I'll eat out for a while. I remember that I said I'd start writing Yelp reviews yesterday at sushi. J. said his friend brought him to a Yelp Elite event that was an open bar and buffet on a really classy boat cruise. Apparently, it was amazing. He's trying to get the same Elite status now, and we turned it into a game to see who can do it first. I write a review for the coffee shop and finish the review for the sushi place.  $6.88 12 p.m. \u2014 I buy Christmas presents for my family. I split the cost of my dad's gift with my sister and brother-in-law; it's a drone that takes cool pictures since he loves nature photography ($26.40). I buy my sister two books and a card game from her wish list, and a rubber-band gun for my brother-in-law from his ($81.90). I spend the next bit of time balancing my budget. If I stick to my plan, I should save $18,000 from now until next October, which is pretty rad. Thinking about it like that, I'll make a serious dent in my student loans once I get my base savings out of the way.  $108.30 Advertisement 5 p.m. \u2014 I spend the rest of the time finishing a freelance project I'm submitting later tonight. They're paying me a couple of grand for it, so that'll be a nice savings bump. I buy a ticket to a formal event in January for a program I'm in, make dinner at home, finish up work, and watch a movie with my roommates. After this week, I'll have $200 left until January 1 based on my budget.

Last night, I babysat with my best friend and she told me about a \u201ccleanse\u201d she recently started. The dietary restrictions and required discipline seemed too farfetched for me, but my biggest takeaway was to try cutting my sugar intake. She says that doing so has worked wonders for her skin and energy levels. I normally spend $30-35 per week on groceries, but spend a bit more today.

I'm not very hungry yet, so I consider waiting to eat breakfast until I get to work. After making a cup of green tea, chatting with the roommate after she returns from yoga (and sharing which T. Swift song is stuck in our heads \u2014 \u201cDelicate\u201d in mine, \u201cGorgeous\u201d in hers), I get dressed and leave my apartment to take the subway into Brooklyn for work. Advertisement 9:35 a.m. \u2014 I arrive, slap on a smile, make a cup of coffee from the Keurig, and raid the snack cabinet for a rice cake. I add peanut butter and honey on top. For the next few hours, I answer various emails, read a lot of tweets, and watch the number of \u201cArticles You Have Left This Month\u201d on  The   New York Times ' website go down. 1:30 p.m. \u2014 Lunch time! I work above a food court, so I take my salad and a book downstairs to the big dining area, and use my full hour to eat, read, and scroll through Instagram. 6:01 p.m. \u2014 I am OUTTA there! I'm a firm believer in leaving work when you have no more work to do, so I'm saved by the 6 o'clock bell! I take the subway home, rocking out to a Christmas playlist I made in high school, and taking a detour at the Trader Joe's wine shop. Sometimes there is a line out the door to just get in, but fortunately it's pretty quiet. I grab two bottles of pinot noir because it's Monday \u2014 and hey, maybe I'll bring one to a holiday party! (Or not.) I walk home, feeling grateful the day's over.  $12.50 8:30 p.m. \u2014 Finally feeling hungry, I make chicken, green peppers, and penne after briefly catching up with my roommate before she goes to a concert. I, on the other hand, have been parked on the couch in front of  E! News  since I got home. Advertisement 9:30 p.m. \u2014 I'm two glasses of wine in, mindlessly swiping through Bumble (I'm newly single), and watching the hilarious  Search Party . I'm also scrolling through Twitter (being a millennial is all about multitasking, isn't it?) and reading about the president's endorsement of a child molester for Alabama senator. Furious, I make a donation to Doug Jones' campaign before going to bed.  $10 Daily Total: $22.50", "day_three": "Day Three: 7:30 a.m. \u2014 Getting out of bed is so hard today. It didn't help that I was in the middle of a stress dream when my alarm went off, so I start my day in a weird mood. I hop into the shower, get out, chat with my roommate (she is the absolute best and we love each other very much!), and she leaves early so she can walk to work. I'm not very hungry, so I make a bowl of Greek yogurt with granola and a little honey before I leave. 9:40 a.m. \u2014 I get to work a few minutes late and immediately make a coffee from the Keurig. Perhaps the yogurt wasn't as filling as I thought, because the coffee goes right through me and I am jittery AF. The most exciting email I receive is an invite to go into my boss' office to pick a name for Secret Santa. I'm excited that I pick out the name of a girl I know fairly well! I brainstorm what to buy for her, feeling grateful for the $20 limit. Advertisement 1:30 p.m. \u2014 A new employee joins me for lunch, and we go downstairs with our lunches from home. I have a different Trader Joe's salad today that is purely vegetables and I am nervous, but it ends up being pretty tasty and very filling! Maybe what they say about vegetables is true \u2014 that you should, like, eat them. 5:55 p.m. \u2014 My to-do list has shrunk, and I'm really excited about my evening plans. I leave the office and take the subway to the Greenwich Village. I have a major pizza craving, so I stop into Joe's Pizza but it's cash only. Double ugh: I left my wad of babysitting cash on my bedside table. I withdraw $20 (with a $2.75 fee) from the ATM outside of Joe's, and eat the most delicious slice of cheese pizza ($3) I've had in a long time.  $5.75 6:50 p.m. \u2014 I walk two blocks through the rain to meet my friend at a cool Belgian beer bar. We haven't seen each other in a few weeks, so after I order a beer (she's been there for a few minutes and already has one) we quickly catch up, commiserate about work, and brainstorm festive Christmas-y things to do together. At 7:30, we realize we're running late to our big event, so we ask for the check and split the bill. I insist on paying for half of \u201cher\u201d fries because I definitely ate half of them.  $13 8:15 p.m. \u2014 We wait outside in the pouring rain for 30 minutes before finally being let into the movie theatre to see  World of Tomorrow 2 , a short film by one of our favorite filmmakers! We are surrounded by fellow film nerds and it is glorious, and the Q&A with the filmmaker is an added bonus. Well worth the $15 I spent on the ticket I ordered two weeks ago. After the movie, we split ways and I take the subway home, chat with my roommate, and get ready for bed.

I roll out of bed, change into appropriate attire, and eat a banana. Somehow this takes me 55 minutes, and I realize I'm going to be a few minutes late. So, I power walk up the street to the caf\u00e9 where I'm meeting someone for the first time in two years; he messaged me on LinkedIn last week asking to catch up. Networking is so awkward, but it's vital in my industry. 8:15 a.m. \u2014 He is running a few minutes late, so I buy myself a coffee to end the awkward stare down I'm getting from the barista.  $2.75 9:15 a.m. \u2014 The meeting goes really well! He basically tried to offer me a job interview, which was flattering. I would have liked to stay longer but I'm running quite late to work, so I head out and take the subway into Brooklyn. Once I get to the office, I resist taking a free doughnut from one of the FOUR boxes on the kitchen table, and opt to make a rice cake with peanut butter and honey. 1:30 p.m. \u2014 I'm borderline hangry after a company-wide \u201cInvesting 101\u201d meeting. I eat lunch by myself today, and it's my last Trader Joe's salad of the week. I take my full hour, then come back upstairs with just a few emails to answer. I make a cup of tea in the office kitchen, and get back to work, which consists of emailing a few people and FedExing a couple Blu-rays. Advertisement 6 p.m. \u2014 The workday is done! I take the subway into Manhattan and walk through Washington Square Park to watch the Christmas tree lighting. About 200 people are crowded around the giant tree, singing carols along with a brass band. I stay for about 10 minutes, reveling in holiday cheer, before walking to a bookstore on a mission to buy a Secret Santa gift. I spend 45 minutes wandering the aisles, and end up getting a 2018 planner for myself and a mug for my Secret Santa.  $33.86 7:45 p.m. \u2014 I walk home and heat up leftover chicken from two nights ago. My roommate comes home from yoga a little after 8, and we catch up and watch  Elf  together while I paint my nails.

Out the door at 6:45, I walk to the gym and spend about 45 minutes there. I walk home, say hey to my roommate who has the day off, and hop in the shower. 8:30 a.m. \u2014 I am running ahead of schedule for the first time since my first week at my job six months ago. I use that extra time to make a smoothie with soy milk, nonfat Greek yogurt, half an avocado, spinach, and a frozen berry medley. After one sip, I confirm that I am a smoothie genius. I take it to-go, and head to the subway. On my commute, I listen to a \u201cBefore a Difficult Conversation\u201d meditation tape. Advertisement 10:15 a.m. \u2014 I've been at work for 35 minutes, and it's time to do something I've been planning for months. I quit my job. Well, I put in my two weeks notice. But yes, I quit my first ever full-time job with (minimal) benefits and a steady salary. It is terrifying and I may have cried a little, but I am so relieved when it's over. I've freelanced in the film industry for the past four years, and while the salary ranges from $10,000-$20,000 per year, my happiness pursuing my various passions fulfills me beyond belief. I text approximately a million friends and receive a wave of congratulatory messages. I absolutely do not need coffee, because between working out this morning and quitting my job, I am feeling energetic AF. Eventually, though, the smell from the coffeemaker in the kitchen draws me in, and I give in. 1:30 p.m. \u2014 Thursdays and Fridays are generally the days I treat myself to lunch from a nearby food hall. I stroll inside with a coworker, and we decide on sandwiches. Normally, their wraps are an obscene $14, but on Thursdays, they have an $10 special on everything. Of course, I pick out the wrap that is $1 extra. After tax, my bill comes to $11.98. My coworker and I eat together and dish on my resignation. I am relaxed at lunch for the first time in months. After eating, we take a look inside the chocolate shop in the food hall. They have the cutest chocolate mini-champagne bottles that I've always needed an excuse to buy, and I decide that there's no better day than today to buy them. I pick up two ($6 each) - one for me, one for my sister, who I'm visiting this weekend.  $25.05 Advertisement 5:30 p.m. \u2014 Everyone in the office ducks out early for a holiday party hosted by the building for all the tenants. There's loud music, dancing, and most importantly: free food and drinks. I have a white wine, a mulled wine ... another mulled wine, and two pieces of pizza. I'm skeptical this will fill me up for dinner, but it's certainly delicious. An hour into the party, I call it a night and take the subway into Manhattan. 7:40 p.m. \u2014 My roommate and I meet at our favorite Mexican place for a celebratory drink. Me quitting my job is almost as exciting for her as it is for me, because she's had to spend the last six months consoling me. I order two tacos and a Paloma, and she gets a taco salad and tequila on the rocks. We split the bill and walk home.  $29.22 Daily Total: $54.27", "day_six": "Day Six: 8 a.m. \u2014 I'm taking a mental health/work-from-home day. I love how getting up at 8 feels luxuriously late. I chat with my roommate as she gets ready for work, and I make a cup of tea, eat a banana, and take a shower. 10:45 a.m. \u2014 After reading a few emails, I walk around the corner to CVS. I pick up makeup, deodorant, toothpaste, and movie theater candy for my Secret Santa. Normally, I have a bunch of coupons, but today I'm coupon-less and paying full price. Damn.  $33.12 12:10 p.m. \u2014 I'm starving and a little headachey. I realize I haven't had any coffee yet, so I make a cup from our Nespresso machine and my headache dissipates. Last night, my mom texted to say that she and my dad have a box of cookies for me at their apartment. I walk over to pick them up since they live a few blocks away from me. On my way home, I stop in Pret A Manger to buy a sandwich, as I don't have any lunch food at home.  $8.15 Advertisement 2 p.m. \u2014 After a 30-minute work conference call, I take the bags I packed this morning and walk to the subway to get to Penn Station. I get there with about 20 minutes to spare before my train, and it's a nice change from frantically running through the station. I buy a one-way NJ Transit ticket to Philadelphia. Off to see my big sister!  $26 5:30 p.m. \u2014 I get to Philadelphia, and per my sister's instructions, take a trolley to meet her at a restaurant. The trolley ticket is $2.50. The trolley system is so confusing compared to the New York subway; there is no way to know where you are because they don't announce each stop! I somehow manage to get off the trolley at the right stop, and walk across the street to meet my sister and her coworkers for dinner. Two glasses of wine and a few slices of pizza later (the four of us split the bill \u2014 $29.56 each, including tip), she and I walk back to her place.  $32.06 Daily Total: $99.33", "day_seven": "Day Seven: 9 a.m. \u2014 We sleep in a bit and wake up to a winter wonderland! We each have a bowl of cereal in my sister's kitchen, get dressed, and decide to walk through the snow to get coffee. When we get to her favorite coffee place, there are no seats available; looks like everyone in the neighborhood also wanted a picturesque morning! We walk a few more blocks to a vegan doughnut shop and each get a coffee. I also order a cinnamon sugar doughnut, and she orders a lemon raspberry. I pay for both of us.  $9.18 Advertisement 10 a.m. \u2014 We make a few stops on the walk back to my sister's place, including to a little bookstore, a pet store (sooo tempted to adopt one of the kittens in the window), and her food co-op. She buys groceries so we can make lunch, and insists on paying. 2 p.m. \u2014 After we make lunch (rice, beans, and veggie stir fry) and eat a few too many of the cookies my parents gave us, we walk around the corner to watch a free choral performance in the outdoor pavilion of a gardening store. Super cool! 6 p.m. \u2014 We spend a few hours warming up in her apartment, then take the trolley ($2.50) into downtown Philly to check out a huge ice rink and winter lodge set up by the river. It is so beautiful and festive, and \u201cAll I Want For Christmas Is You\u201d plays about three times in a row. I am in heaven. We warm up next to a fire, then walk into the most Christmas-y looking pub we can find for dinner. Feeling a cold coming on, I order a hot toddy (sister does, too) and am shocked at the low price of $7.50. \u201cWelcome to Philly!\u201d my loving sister taunts. I get a hamburger, she gets fish and chips, and we each get a drink called \u201cFestive Fashioned\u201d after our hot toddies. This spin on the Old Fashioned is a price I'm more used to, $11. Totally worth it. We split the bill.  $40.70 Advertisement 8 p.m. \u2014 I need to buy another ride on the trolley to get home, and my sister suggests I buy two trolley tokens for $4 instead of one trolley card for $2.50 in case we ride the trolley tomorrow. I'll say it again: the Philly subway/trolley system is confusing.  $4 9 p.m. \u2014 We get home after an extraordinarily snowy and festive day, and call it a night \u2014 happy to be cozy and warm together.

I wanted to head back to the city by 5 p.m. to avoid Sunday traffic, but it looks like that isn't happening. We get to C.'s brother's farm where he's made a feast for everyone who helped with the harvest. We drink lots of good wine and eat sausages, cheese, bread, and tons of fresh veggies from the farm, plus the rest of C.'s fudge from last night. 10:30 p.m. \u2014 I can't believe we left so late. Of course we hit traffic, and it takes us over three hours to get home. I shower and crawl into bed extremely cranky and unenthused to end my weekend this way.

I think it went well, and I'm interested in the opportunity. Unfortunately, the interview is across town from my office and there aren't any good subway options.

However, I am not a morning person and decide to Uber because I am running late. I Uber more often than I care to admit, but the $6.41 price point doesn't make me feel too guilty. I run to Wawa to grab a coffee before going into my office building. I used to make coffee at home everyday, but it started to become too difficult to navigate the travel mug on crowded city buses. I forgot to pack breakfast on my way out the door, so I also get fresh fruit, bringing my breakfast total to $5.53.  $11.94 12 p.m. \u2014 I have to mail in an $80 payment for a ticket I received, so I run to the post office during lunch. The self-service line is shorter, but the minimum purchase is three stamps. $1.47 is a small price to pay for not waiting in line, though. I was away for the holiday weekend and don't have any food in my house. I'll be eating out until I have a chance to shop for groceries on Saturday. I buy a Cobb salad and sparkling water from my favorite local lunch spot. I also snag a bag of free pretzels from the office kitchenette.  $92.24 Advertisement 3 p.m. \u2014 I'm coordinating a bridal shower purchase with my friends from college. The shower isn't for a few more weeks, but I like to get something off the registry early. We settle on a big item from the registry, and a small, complementary, off-registry item. I grab free Laffy Taffys and chips from the kitchenette for an afternoon snack.  $54.25 6:15 p.m. \u2014 Since it is raining out when I leave work, I take the bus home rather than walk. I use a token that I purchased with my monthly pre-tax commuter FSA. I eat takeout leftovers when I get home, and change into workout clothes. I purchased a yoga package a while ago from the studio around the corner, so I opt for a 7:30 class. I am almost deterred by a friend who wants to grab drinks, but I need the exercise.

After my workout, I make a shake with PB2, a banana, and 2% milk. I respond to a few emails from my VP before getting ready, and end up running later than planned. I decide to Uber, but cancel when the driver doesn't look like he knows where he is going. I'm not up to speed on the cancelation policy, and get hit with a $5 fee. It takes two more tries to get a driver who appears more familiar with the area, and sets me back $11.28 for the surcharge and the fare. I still grab a coffee from Wawa before going into the office. Since I pay in cash, I drop the change into the charitable donation box next to the register.  $13.28 Advertisement 1 p.m. \u2014 Our corporate cafeteria offers a salad bar special on Fridays, so I usually do that for Friday lunch.

The bride is letting us wear whatever we want, as long as it is black. I peruse Nordstrom and see that the dress I originally wanted is 40% off. It wasn't a purchase I planned to make today, but I have been putting it off. I bite the bullet and order.  $160.50 5:30 p.m. \u2014 I make my weekly visit to the nail salon. I've been going to the same one every week for five years so everyone is super chatty and friendly. I opt for a gel manicure because I want it to last two weeks, and I also get a pedicure. Including tip (and the ATM surcharge), the services are $75. I stop in our brand new, massive Whole Foods on my walk home to get my favorite local hummus for dinner, and also grab some snacks.  $92.68 7:30 p.m. \u2014 After debating going out, I pour a glass of wine and veg on the couch.

The class was already paid for, so I drive downtown and pay the $3 for parking, and get an iced coffee from Starbucks as my reward when I am finished.  $7.05 12 p.m. \u2014 I am in a shore house part-time, and I head to New Jersey to stock up on supplies for my next trip down. I stop at the liquor store for a handle of vodka; NJ liquor store prices are far better than PA, and it sets me back $31.75. Next stop is Target to get essentials for my home in Philly, as well for the shore. I prefer to make my own meals down there rather than go out to eat. The bill is on the larger side \u2014 $150 \u2014 but I know that I am saving money in the long run. I stop by the grocery store to pick up the few remaining items I can't get from Target \u2014 chicken sausage and broccoli ($10.54). I get gas on my way out of NJ, which is another $18.50.

A friend texts and asks if I want to go to a new pizza place that just opened in our neighborhood. It has gotten great reviews, and it feels good to get out of the house. The pizza was good, but a little overhyped. Regardless, a good way to kill a few hours.  $14 Advertisement 8 p.m. \u2014 I finally finish  The Keepers  and lament to my cat about how hard it is to continue to be a Catholic.

My friend who originally paid for the tickets needs to be reimbursed, so I Venmo her $35. While I'm at it, I use Venmo to pay back another friend.

I eat my lunch and all the snacks I packed, and pick up an espresso and a bag of popcorn from the kitchenette. I resist the urge to go to Starbucks for a cake pop. 5:30 p.m. \u2014 It's a nice night so I walk home. I take the longer route past all the neighborhood bars to see if I know anyone sitting outside. I used the last of the butter when I made eggs yesterday, so I stop in CVS to pick up more. I debate between yoga and a run. Since I am still coughing, I decide to run because I could be disruptive in a yoga class. It is really hot, but I listen to a podcast and push through.  $4.49 Advertisement 8:30 p.m. \u2014 For dinner, I reheat a turkey burger and fry an egg.

I am already over this week, but knowing I only have two days of work left before going to the shore for a long weekend gets me through.  $8.49 2 p.m. \u2014 Work is going pretty quickly today, and I cross a bunch of things off my to-do list. A bonus: My dress for the wedding arrives! I ordered two different sizes and they sent the wrong dress in one of the sizes. Womp, womp. I call Nordstrom and they overnight me the correct dress for delivery the next day. 5:30 p.m. \u2014 It's hot and I have to carry the dress box home, so I opt for the bus. I try them on when I get home, and neither works. I'm grateful that Nordstrom has a free returns policy so I can send them back without penalty. 7 p.m. \u2014 My friend hosts Quizzo at a local bar and I'm tempted to go, but I still feel under the weather, and I haven't packed for the weekend. I make the responsible choice to stay home, do laundry, and pack. I also cook up some turkey sausage for my next few meals, and make turkey burgers to take with me this weekend.

I finish the last few things I have for the week, put my out-of-office message on, and head out at 5. 6:30 p.m. \u2014 I meet my friends at a local bar before the concert. I have a beer, and my friend picks up the tab. I get the Uber to the venue. It's over in NJ, so I am not surprised it is almost $20. I add a tip since the driver will have to pay the toll on the way back.  $23 7:30 p.m. \u2014 For some reason, my friend picks up the tab for the entire night. It is odd, but I get tired of trying to pay or give her money and just go with it. We drink vodka lemonades, but I probably should have opted for water. It is ridiculously hot and I can feel myself becoming dehydrated. 10:30 p.m. \u2014 After the concert is over, we walk to a nearby bar to wait out traffic. I chug a few club sodas and sip a vodka soda. My friend picks up the tab and the Uber home. Once we are back in the neighborhood, we stop in a local bar to catch up with friends. I stay much later than I intended to, but it's a good time. Drinks plus tip are $25. We stop at Wawa on the way home because I never ate dinner. Better late than never, I guess.

Open Amazon, where I thought I made a purchase last night (books, hair oil, sling back strap holders, and an anti-blister stick for $166.15). It turns out that everything I \"ordered\" is still in my cart, with no record of the order being processed.

{"title": "A Week In Santa Barbara, CA, On A $129,000 Salary", "intro": "Occupation:  Architect Industry:  Architecture & Design Age:  26 Location:  Santa Barbara, CA Salary:  $129,000, for the past two years. The prior 2.5 years, I was making about $50,000 less, but one of our head architects left the firm and I was offered his position. I have worked really hard to become good at my job, and even with that I was very surprised they offered me the job. It's uncommon to get this opportunity this early in this field; I\u2019m so lucky and pleased that I did. Paycheck (2x/month):  $4,100 Advertisement Monthly Expenses Housing:  $500 lease payment for a two-bedroom, two-bathroom pool house on a family friend's property, all utilities included. (That's nowhere near the norm for this area. My friend heard that I couldn\u2019t find an apartment that allowed large dogs, and offered me their unused pool house for a steal, in exchange for architectural services and babysitting their kids when needed. I renovated the house during the time I\u2019ve lived in it, and I have LOVED the process.) Loan Payments:  None. All my schooling was covered by scholarship. I also got all my general studies done through the local community college while I was still in high school. It was hard, but totally worth it. I was able to graduate from college with a master's, a completed internship, and an architecture license in four years instead of seven. It pays to work hard in high school! Car Insurance:  $91 \u2014 should be noted that my parents bought me a car as a college graduation present. I am insanely grateful. They used a portion of my college fund, which was started when I was born, and which they and I contributed to over the years. The rest of the college fund became their vacation fund, which they deserve. Internet:  $40 Amazon Prime:  $99/yearly Phone Bill:  $0 \u2014 covered by company Credit Card Payments:  Differs month to month. I paid off my college credit card debt about nine months ago. After I landed my job (which was three months out of school), I stopped using my credit card except for hotels, clothes, and flights to get points and miles. I pay it off in full every month, so it just depends on how much I use it. Past month was only $70. Advertisement All Other Monthly Expenses Gym Membership:  Free general (my company designed the gym), but I pay $50/month for unlimited classes. Netflix:  $12. My whole family uses my log-in. Spotify:  $8 Car Cleaning Product Delivery:  $50 for professional car detailing products every three months. It's a hobby; it's therapeutic, and also a little weird, but my car looks damn good. Personal   Savings:  $1,000 into personal savings. I pay nothing for my current housing or car. I could contribute more, but I like shoes and travel.  Joint Savings:  $500 in joint savings with my boyfriend. He contributes around $200 right now as he is paying off med school loans. Marriage is a sure thing for us, and once married, we have decided that we will combine all our finances. Until then, I started a savings account that he cosigned on, most likely to be used to buy property to build a house on. FaceTory Subscription:  $25", "day_one": "Day One: 7 a.m. \u2014 Wake up. Feed my dog-child. Eat a protein bar on the patio while checking emails. If I woke up earlier, I would have time to make breakfast, but sleep is so good. Get ready, which entails a quick shower, skincare routine, and mascara. (In the mornings, I cleanse, tone, moisturize, apply eye cream. I love trying new products and am always changing it up. I always go back to Korres for my cleanser and moisturizer though. I haven\u2019t found anything better. My favorite mascara is Two Faced Better than Sex.) Then I head out the door. I\u2019ve trained my hair to air dry exactly how I want it to over the years. It is insanely curly, so I just throw some product on it and let it do its thing; no point in fighting it. Advertisement 8:15 a.m. \u2014 Have to stop to get gas on the way to the office (I fill up the tank) so I\u2019m a tad late. Stop into the kitchen to get a glass of cold brew with almond milk and a dog treat before the weekly progress morning meeting. Our office is stalked with various types of coffee and water so I never buy either. I drink approximately a million LaCroix and at least three liters of water from my hydroflask every day. My boss and I are obsessed with my dog, so I get to bring him to work. I cannot express how much I love my job for this, and a thousand other reasons.  $58 8:30 a.m. \u2014 Put in my headphones, turn on my podcast, and get to work; same routine every single day. I listen to the same few regularly, but my most recent favorite is  True Crime Garage \u2014  it's so interesting and in-depth. We have an in-office chat on our computers, so if anyone needs to talk to anyone else, they message you first \u2014 hence why I can wear headphones without being rude. 12:25 p.m. \u2014 Long morning of calls and drawing. We are an exclusively commercial firm (no houses or residential projects of any kind), and we are each responsible for entire projects. It is a smaller firm so we don\u2019t really have the manpower to do collaborative projects in terms of actual production. That means I do everything from initial concept to full construction sets of plans, all needed documents, and then the construction management until the project is closed out. We do help red-line (correct) each other\u2019s plans, and all designs are signed off on by the owner of the firm. We also have a few draftsmen that help on most projects on a case-by-case basis. In most firms, the architect will do the design and oversee the project and the meat of the drawing, and production is done by draftsmen. I much prefer total control of the project. It makes for a longer turnover time for clients, but I love that I get to do both the creative and technical sides of the industry. Advertisement 12:45 p.m. \u2014 A coworker and I head to lunch to decompress. Street tacos from our favorite local place and a side of chicken for dog-child. His turn to pay. 3:30 p.m. \u2014 Site meeting with new contractor on a project about to break ground. I pick up a box of donuts (a.k.a., please-don\u2019t-be-a-dick-to-me snacks) on the way there. I have found that most contractors don\u2019t take to well to a woman being the one in charge of them, especially a 26-year-old one. I completely understand, and that mentality doesn\u2019t bother me in the least. This has been a male-dominated industry for a very long time and I love that I have the opportunity to be a part of it and help it grow \u2014 but for now, donuts tend to help ease them into realizing that I\u2019m actually decent at my job.  $20  (Not expensed because this is my thing, not a company requirement.) 6 p.m. \u2014 Site meeting done. Contractor was fantastic, subcontractors not so much. I can see some serious problems down the line. Hopefully their teams are better than they are. Head back to the office to pick up my stuff and head home. 7 p.m. \u2014 Get back home and start on dinner. Cooking is one of my favorite ways to relax. Tonight, it's fish tacos with whatever veggies I find left in my fridge, mostly just carrots and cucumber. My boyfriend Skypes while I\u2019m cooking. He is currently living in Washington doing his residency at a hospital. We Skype once or twice a week when he gets chance. Residency is no joke, but he\u2019s only got three months left before he gets to move back here, where he has already accepted a job offer. My dog always eats his dog food at the same time as I do; he doesn\u2019t like eating alone. He\u2019s more human than dog. Also, I call him dog-child because that exactly what he is. He is two-years-old and the love of my life. I\u2019m a fully admitted crazy dog lady and I love it. Advertisement 10:30 p.m. \u2014 Go for a long walk with the dog-child around the property after dinner. He chased squirrels and I enjoyed the quiet. Skin care routine (nightly: double cleanse face, exfoliate every other day, toner, serum, corrector, moisturizer, eye cream and spot treatment if needed) and pass out as soon as we got home. Daily total: $78", "day_two": "Day Two: 6:45 a.m. \u2014 Same morning routine as yesterday, but I\u2019m out of protein bars and I\u2019m starving. Quick stop for a green smoothie ($8) filled with all sorts of healthy stuff. Also stop at my favorite fruit stand and get strawberries ($4) since, let's be honest, green smoothies aren\u2019t exactly filling.  $12 8 a.m. \u2014 Make it to the office on time this morning. Cold brew and almond milk again. 9 a.m. \u2014 Spend a quick hour prepping for a design meeting with a new client, and ordering bagels ($35, expensed). Jobs are dispersed by the boss as they come in. The larger ones go to head architects, and the smaller go to what we call project architects. Our boss does a great job at keeping it very even and giving us clients that we will work well with. One of my coworkers has been working exclusively with one large scale client on multiple projects for almost four years. 11:30 a.m. \u2014 Design meeting went as well as could be hoped for with a new client. Our design styles don\u2019t match quite as well as I\u2019d hoped, but I think we will be able to make it work. Advertisement 12 p.m. \u2014 Lunch time. Our new summer intern just started and I haven\u2019t gotten the chance to get to know him at all. A coworker and I take him out to lunch. We walk over to the sandwich place a few blocks away. I have the veggie sandwich with spinach, tomato, roasted peppers, onion, avocado, pickles, and sriracha aioli on toasted wheat. The intern seems like a good kid, and he and my dog are already friends. My treat today.  $46 6:30 p.m. \u2014 Long afternoon of cranking away on construction documents. Head out of the office and to the grocery store. I make it quick so that dog-child can wait in the car. Trader Joe's has a lot of good shady parking spots, so I head there. I get broccoli, bananas, peppers, quinoa, protein bars (Gomacro are the best), Ezekiel bread, feta cheese, and vegan butter. In and out in 10 minutes. That will hold me over until I go to the farmers' market on Saturday. As far as diet goes, I eat mostly-healthy. I don\u2019t follow any labeled lifestyle, but I tend to stay away from most dairy and sugar. I don\u2019t eat much processed or packaged food, mostly because I love cooking. The one rule I very rarely break is no drinking during the work week. I can\u2019t afford to be tired and foggy at work.  $41 7:15 p.m. \u2014 Drop groceries and dog off at home and head to the gym. TRX class tonight taught by my landlord. I thought my hydroflask was full, but I guess I drank it all. I won\u2019t make it through her class without water, so I grab a bottle from the \u201cprotein bar\u201d in the gym.  $4 Advertisement 9 p.m. \u2014 Get home and start dinner. Keeping it simple tonight with just some saut\u00e9ed veggies and quinoa covered in sriracha. 11 p.m. \u2014 Head to bed after letting dog-child swim for a little while. He loves swimming but isn\u2019t very good, so I have to watch him. He\u2019s so large (140 pounds) that he pretty much sinks if he stops paddling. I tried to get him a life vest, but he hated it. I also put on a couple of masks while watching him swim, an Aztec clay mask and a Dr. Jart sheet mask while half-watching  Master of None . Daily Total: $103", "day_three": "Day Three: 6:45 a.m. \u2014 Same morning routine, with a protein bar today. I hate mornings, so I really don\u2019t do much other than the bare minimum. 8 a.m. \u2014 Head into work and get started on plan, and check comments for a project that I\u2019m hoping will break ground in the next three months. Cold brew with almond milk as always. 1:45 p.m. \u2014 No meetings this morning, so I get completely lost in work. Dog is hungry and won't let me keep working without feeding him. We run down the street to a little family Greek place. I get a combo plate with moussaka, spanakopita, Greek salad, and humus with pita; he gets chicken. We are both very happy. Yes, I eat lunch out every day. I hate both mornings and meal prepping, and I love being able to take a break outside the office. It\u2019s expensive, but I don\u2019t plan on stopping any time soon. I justify it by only eating at local places and telling myself I\u2019m supporting the local economy and small businesses.  $18 Advertisement 6 p.m. \u2014 Leave the office and because of the late lunch, I\u2019m not dying to get home and eat dinner. We head to the beach for a little while, and my boyfriend\u2019s brother meets us there with his dog. 8:30 p.m. \u2014 After a long beach walk, we get home and I make toast with almond butter and bananas. 9 p.m. \u2014 Zone out on the couch watching Netflix. Sitting in front of the computer all day really drains me, so I head to bed early tonight. Skin care routine first, then sleep.

Really exciting celebration, I know.  $7 8 a.m. \u2014 Get into work and the monthly coffee delivery shows up. My boss is a huge coffee nerd and this is his favorite day of the month. 12:30 p.m. \u2014 Lunch time after working on plans all morning. (I really didn\u2019t realize how often I ate tacos until I started writing this.) Tacos for me and chicken for dog-child again, but from a different restaurant.  $13 4 p.m. \u2014 Since it's Friday, we all leave work early. I head home and change and go to the gym, hopefully for spin if they have any openings. 5:30 p.m. \u2014 No openings for class, so I do some HIIT exercises and throw in abs for good measure. Grab a water on my way out.  $4 Advertisement 5:45 p.m. \u2014 Quick stop for gas.  $45 6 p.m. \u2014 Pick up dog from my house and go to my parents' for dinner. My dad calls and asks if can pick up soy sauce on the way. After I get there, he finishes his grilled, glazed salmon and vegetables. I definitely got my love of cooking from him.  $6 7 p.m. \u2014 My mom wants to go shopping, and I never turn down a good shopping trip. We go to Nordstrom and head for the shoe department, my weakness. I end up getting a new pair of fantastic wedges that are on sale for a crazy price. Then we head over to Lululemon: weakness number two. If I\u2019m not at the office, I\u2019m wearing leggings from there. I pick up a new pair of leggings and a couple of headbands.  $273 10:30 p.m. \u2014 Get home and Skype with the BF. Dog-child stayed with my dad while I went shopping, so he is worn out from playing. Fall asleep a couple of hours later and thank my lucky stars I don\u2019t have to wake up early tomorrow. Daily Total: $348", "day_five": "Day Five: 8:15 a.m. \u2014 This is what I consider sleeping in now and that\u2019s a little sad, but it also means I get the best pick of food at the farmers' market. Dog-child and I head down and buy all the food: mixed greens, cucumbers, tomatoes, snap peas, peaches, carrots, sweet onions, avocados, corn, jalape\u00f1os, nectarines, eggs, almond butter, cherries, tortillas, shrimp, and a delicious breakfast sandwich with egg, caramelized onions and peppers, and spicy sauce on an English muffin. I love the farmers' market because you know it's local, and you also can control exactly how much you are getting. There are no fresher options either; almost everything was either picked within the last three days, caught this morning, or made this week. It makes it so easy to eat healthy when healthy food tastes this good.  $60 Advertisement 11:30 a.m. \u2014 While putting away my groceries, there is a knock at my door. That never happens and it\u2019s a little weird. I go over and hesitantly answer it. It\u2019s my boyfriend! He got his schedule for the week a couple of days ago and he had three days in a row off, which is unheard of for him, so he decided to grab a plane ticket and come surprise me! We haven\u2019t seen each other in almost three months and this is about the best surprise I could have imagined! 3:30 p.m. \u2014 We spend a few hours just hanging out, swimming, snacking on some of my groceries, and playing with the dog (who is more excited to see my boyfriend than I even was). We get ready and head to his parents' for before going to dinner.

Apparently, he told everyone but me he was coming. Nice. Our families have been friends for as long as anyone can remember \u2014 long before we started dating \u2014 so it\u2019s always fun to hang out together. 5:30 p.m. \u2014 Everyone heads to dinner at one of our favorite local places. Our dads split the check. They are the best. 10:30 p.m. \u2014 My boyfriend, and three of our six-combined siblings, my best friend, and I all head to the bar for a little bit.

He pays. 9:30 a.m. \u2014 We walk around downtown for a little while through a couple vintage stores. I am working on the master bath right now, which is my last room to finish renovating. I find the most amazing patterned black and white tile for the shower, but they only have one box. It's crazy cheap, and I buy it in hopes that my tile guy can replicate it.  $35 12:30 p.m. \u2014 Pick up dog child and head to the beach where we end up spending the rest of the day. I live so close to the beach that I always have a couple of towels and a swimsuit in my car. I never really plan beach days but always seem to end up there. Buy a fruit bowl and waters from a stand in the parking lot. BF pays. 7:45 p.m. \u2014 Get home and make dinner: a huge salad with a variety of veggies from the farmers' market and balsamic dressing I make weekly. (It's best dressing ever: two-thirds of a cup of olive oil, one-third of a cup of balsamic vinegar, minced garlic, salt and pepper, whisked until emulsified). Grilled corn and peaches with a drizzle of balsamic vinegar on the side. So good! I really love cooking with him. We\u2019ve been dating for four years and have been waiting until we live in the same city again to get engaged. Both of us are super ready and excited to do the whole marriage thing (and kids someday); we just don\u2019t want to be living in different states when we start that part of our lives.

I texted my boss and asked if I could take the morning off today. He said absolutely, and that I could have the entire day if I wanted. Boyfriend flies back to Washington at 1, so I can head into work after that. We lay around for a while, dreading the impending drive to the airport. 9:30 a.m. \u2014 Drag ourselves out of bed and go to the smoothie place. We each get a smoothie and a \u201cdog-\u00e7ai\u201d bowl for dog-child (peanut butter and oats and a dog cookie). Long beach walk while we drink our smoothies.  $21 11:45 a.m. \u2014 Drop off boyfriend at the airport. It sucks, bad. I\u2019m not a crier or even very emotional in general, so that\u2019s a big plus in these situations, but it obviously still sucks. Hopefully, I will make it up to Washington soon and only three months before he is back here for good.  $10  (for parking) 2 p.m. \u2014 I was going to go to work, but I\u2019m too lazy. I answer most of my emails from the porch and then clean my house. I\u2019m a bit intense when it comes to my home, and I normally deep clean my place every Saturday morning after the farmers' market, but that didn\u2019t happen, so I do it now! It feels really good to have a clean space to start the week. I also throw in a few loads of laundry, give the dog a bath, and clean the pool. I\u2019m trying out this whole audiobook thing, so I listen to a new one while I clean. Not really liking it. The book seems good but being read to feels a bit like elementary school. I have credits, so the book is free. Advertisement 8 p.m. \u2014 My best friend comes over and I make us dinner. We normally hang out and catch up on our weeks on the weekend, but I was a bit preoccupied this weekend. She\u2019s a teacher and we pretty much gave up on weeknight hangouts because of pure exhaustion. Balsamic glazed vegetables because I LOVE balsamic vinegar. (Given the choice between that and any sweet, I will literally drink the vinegar.) I also make grilled shrimp. We eat while watching  The Bachelor  and both fall asleep on the couch. Eventually, we wake up and drag ourselves to bed. My guest room is pretty much her bedroom. I even put her own set of toiletries in the bathroom for her.

It's especially hard to get out of bed when my boyfriend and the dogs are still fast asleep. He works for himself and has a very flexible schedule, which means he rarely has to wake up early. I'm jealous. We ran out of coffee pods over the weekend, so I leave the house without caffeine. I resist the urge to Lyft to work and take the subway and walk instead. 7:45 a.m. \u2014 I hit the coffee shop by my office for a large iced coffee. It is the first morning in months that I feel tempted to go for a hot beverage, but I'm not there quite yet.  $4 Advertisement 8:30 a.m. \u2014 After jumping into the neglected project, I run upstairs for breakfast. Our cafeteria is subsidized, so the prices are amazing. I get my typical scramble with veggies and cheese, along with a side of berries, for under $3. I also realize that I forgot to bring the lunch I packed and get annoyed at myself.  $2.75 12 p.m. \u2014 Outlook reminds me that I have a lunch presentation to attend, meaning lunch will be provided. I eat a lackluster, but free, catered lunch of a tuna salad sandwich (that I thought was chicken), pasta salad, a veggie salad, and a cookie. I am much more excited about the new pro-bono project centered on juvenile justice that we're starting, than the lunch. 4 p.m. \u2014 Coffee pods have arrived! I seize on this interruption to take a break and do my weekly review of my finances. I look to make sure that my myriad transfers from Friday's paycheck have made it to the right places (multiple savings accounts, my credit card, to my local bank for cash withdrawals). I pay another $300 on my credit card to cover a few Amazon purchases from last week of dog food,  coffee pods, and a bamboo bathmat, as well as an Everlane purchase \u2014 a crossbody purse I bought for an upcoming trip to Italy.  $300 5 p.m. \u2014 It is very quiet today, and there's nothing I can't work on from home at this point, so I leave and again resist the temptation to Lyft. Advertisement 8 p.m. \u2014 We have multiple types of leftovers in the fridge that need to be eaten, so dinner is a mishmash of Chinese, Mediterranean, and nouveau American (a.k.a. a random concoction of barley and roast veggies). We both hate wasting food, so these dinners happen on occasion to ensure that we throw out as little as possible. The dogs lie in wait under the table for scraps, despite the fact that they definitely got dinner. Their patience is rewarded when I give in and give them bits of pork and carrot. I am a complete sucker. The night sees us throwing in the towel on a puzzle that has been lingering on the coffee table for weeks, and \"celebrating\" our defeat with bourbon from our bar cart. Daily Total: $306.75", "day_two": "Day Two: 8 a.m. \u2014 I have hit snooze approximately 15 times. It's a wonder my boyfriend still sleeps in the same room as me. He must love me. I drag myself out of bed, shower, and then make myself a few pods of coffee that I sip while puttering around, watering our backyard plants, and feeding the pups. 9 a.m. \u2014 I sip more coffee while waiting around to go over projects with a contractor and my boyfriend. I bought a house that needs a lot of help, and I seriously underestimated the amount of time and money this would involve. It's been over a year and there is still a lot to do. Unlike what HGTV or any other home remodeling show would have you believe, there are not beautiful, original, hardwood floors underneath every old carpet. In fact, if I could just uncover one thing that hasn't been jerry-rigged in a perplexing, completely unsafe way that requires fixing from the ground up, I would be thrilled. I have already put about $40,000 into the house, including some very sexy electrical and plumbing repairs. Some of that was from a home improvement loan that I am still paying back. I took it out because I had no idea what things cost, and because parts of my house seem to have been built with toothpicks and chewing gum. Advertisement 10:30 a.m. \u2014 The estimate for the next fix is $2,800. This feels like a rip-off, but this is also the only contractor we have been able to get to the house in months. Philly is going through a major building boom, according to my former contractor, who is now too busy to come back and do more work. My boyfriend is paying for the next phase of renovations because I haven't let him pay rent since he moved in a few months back. He is already very generous and never lets me pay when we go out, or travel. Plus, I am stubborn and proud of the fact that I can pay all my bills on my own (including the ton of money I pay each month to correct some very dumb money mistakes). The compromise is that he will pay for renovations because he wants to contribute, and he wants us to be able to use the rooms that still need to be finished. 11 a.m. \u2014 I didn't eat anything at home, so after I get off the subway, I grab an iced coffee and bagel with peanut butter from the coffee shop by my work ($7, including tip). The coffee tastes like coffee-flavored water and the bagel is weirdly fluffy, but peanut butter renders most things edible and I eat half.  $7 1:30 p.m. \u2014 I eat the last dregs of the leftover Chinese and Mediterranean food and browse Sephora online. I need more of my sunscreen, but am also in the market for a new body wash. I decide to hold off and hit the actual store on my way home because I need to smell test any body wash. I then check in on my Outnet wish list and see if any of the items I want have been further discounted. I used to have a major impulse-shopping issue. Apparently, depression and being in an unhappy marriage triggered my need to self-soothe via material things. This was a terrible \"solution,\" especially since, until recently, I made a third of my current salary. Therapy, a divorce, a new job, and a healthier relationship have all contributed to my ability to really make a dent on my debt, stop the impulse shopping, and feel good about myself. I still love beautiful things, but I now budget and save for them, instead of throwing them on my credit card. Advertisement 6 p.m. \u2014 It has been raining all day, so I don't feel like going out of my way to walk to Sephora. I mentally applaud myself for choosing the subway over the convenience of a cab. 8:30 p.m. \u2014 My boyfriend and I spend a few hours cleaning up and hanging art, so neither of us feels like trying to cook dinner. We walk to the all-too-convenient pub around the corner instead. I get my go-to meal of a Caesar salad and side of meatballs, and also drink two glasses of wine. My boyfriend pays. Daily Total: $7", "day_three": "Day Three: 7 a.m. \u2014 I have coffee at home while I get ready for work. 8:30 a.m. \u2014 I still need another hit of coffee, so I grab a large cold brew at the coffee shop by my work. I wish it was better, but it's also very convenient ($4, including tip). Once at work, I run upstairs to get a veggie and cheese scramble, with a side of berries ($2.75).  $6.75 10:30 a.m. \u2014 I get an email notification that sale items at Rag & Bone are now an additional 30% off because of Labor Day promotions. I have had my eye on a blazer and jeans that have been in the sale section for over two months. The blazer was originally $495 and the jeans $250, but my patience has paid off and I get both.  $262 12:30 p.m. \u2014 Lunch is leftover salad and meatballs, both of which are still delicious. While I eat, I book a Megabus reservation to NYC for tomorrow. I am attending a celebration for a dear friend of mine who had a very rough spring and summer, but who has made it through and deserves a ton of love and support; there is no way I wouldn't show up. I would have spent at least $150 on Amtrak, and I just can't stomach that, so Megabus it is.  $24.50 Advertisement 4:30 p.m. \u2014 I brought an apple and peanut butter to work and munch on that while I enter my time for the past week. Entering time might be the worst part about being an attorney. 6 p.m. \u2014 I meet up with one of my best friends for dinner. It has been far too long since we caught up and we spend three hours drinking wine, and having our favorite snacks and salads at our go-to wine bar. I treat because her birthday was a couple of days before.  $120 9:30 p.m. \u2014 I walk to the subway after dinner, texting my boyfriend my location updates along the way.

I make a coffee at home and drink a bunch of water while getting ready. Thankfully, it has been very quiet this week, so leaving early is feasible. 8:30 a.m. \u2014 I detour to my old favorite coffee shop, La Colombe, and grab an iced coffee and a ham and cheese croissant.  $7 12 p.m. \u2014 I venture out to grab a card for the friend I'll be seeing tonight. I can't choose between two, so I get them both and will make a game-time decision.  $12.86 12:30 p.m. \u2014 While I'm out, I remember that I still haven't bought sunscreen, so I swing into Sephora and put the blinders on to avoid making any impulse purchases. I do have a lot of points, though, so I use some of those on a mini-Origins charcoal mask because my skin is acting up. I blame the wine.  $35.64 Advertisement 1 p.m. \u2014 I eat a cafeteria lunch of chicken curry soup and salad. Both are marginal, but fill me up all the same.  $8.10 2:45 p.m. \u2014 I hail a cab and zoom over to the Megabus station and I am off to NYC! I regret that I didn't bring water or a snack as we immediately hit traffic.  $10 6 p.m. \u2014 I arrive just on time to my friend's shindig at a lovely cocktail bar I haven't been to before. Lots of familiar faces, but also quite a few new ones. She is very well loved. I have an abundance of wine, and also champagne that is passed around for a toast. I only manage to snack on approximately three bites of chicken skewers and one mini-cupcake \u2014 a decision I will come to regret later. In true tipsy form, I Venmo way too much for my share of drinks to my other friend who organized the party.  $100 11 p.m. \u2014 Also true to form, I miss my bus and am persuaded to stay the night at my friend's apartment. In a wine-fueled daze, I call my boyfriend who assures me that he and the dogs will be fine, and then somehow manage to book an early train and set an alarm.  $56 Daily Total: $229.60", "day_five": "Day Five: 6:45 a.m. \u2014 I should have eaten more yesterday. And drank more water.

I Lyft my way to Penn Station.  $16.29 Advertisement 7:30 a.m. \u2014 I desperately need caffeine and to eat something, so I grab an egg, bacon, and cheese sandwich at the station. Then I search for Advil and water. The card reader is down at the store and I only have enough cash for either water or Advil, and not enough time to go to another shop. I go for the Advil and wash it down with coffee.  $11.59 9:30 a.m. \u2014 I arrive back home in Philadelphia and take a taxi to my house. I have definitely hit my taxi/Lyft quota for the week/month.  $13.89 11 a.m. \u2014 I desperately hoped I could work from home today. First, because of how I am feeling; second, because my boyfriend found a contractor who is willing to come by for another quote. Unfortunately, there are some issues popping up at work, and it looks like I have to make a physical appearance. I hop on the subway. 1 p.m. \u2014 I brought leftover rice and stir-fried vegetables that my boyfriend cooked last night. I eat at my desk while I push through a project. My boyfriend calls and says that the new contractor quoted us $2,700 for the original project, as well as a lot of other random odds and ends we also need fixed. This is much better news. I cross my fingers that we can actually get him to start the project in the near future. 4 p.m. \u2014 The office is closing early for Labor Day weekend! I wrap up things up in time to take advantage of early closure. My boyfriend is cooking a ton of food to take with us to the Poconos over the weekend, and he asks me to grab a few ingredients on my way home. We are joining a crew of people tomorrow and they asked my boyfriend make his amazing pulled pork and different salsas. I swing by the corner market and grab tortillas, queso fresco, cotija, epazote, Jarritos soda, avocados, and cilantro.  $28.70 Advertisement 8 p.m. \u2014 We spend several hours cooking \u2014 meaning that I \"supervised\" and cleaned up, while he did all the heavy lifting. With all the taste testing along the way, neither of us is really hungry, so we have a few beers, chips, and salsa and call it dinner. 10 p.m. \u2014 Ever the procrastinators, we finally get around to packing for tomorrow. I also book a last-minute dog walker for the pups. We don't know all the couples who will be in the Poconos or how well the dogs will do with their kids, so we decide not to chance any bad encounters. My Chihuahua will probably prefer to stay home where it's warm and not spend two nights in a tent when it's supposed to be rainy and cool anyway.  $75 Daily Total: $145.47", "day_six": "Day Six: 10 a.m. \u2014 We manage to get on the road at a decent hour, despite me having to spend the morning dealing with an unexpected work issue. In the panic of the work problem and getting the dogs' food, toys, leashes, and blankets in order for the walker (who isn't my usual person), I forget to drink coffee. We decide to just get out of town and deal with coffee once we are clear of the city. 11:10 a.m. \u2014 As a non-native Philadelphian, I don't think I will ever understand the love for Wawa that many of my friends have. I suspect they would be less enthralled if they had to frequent the one we stopped at somewhere along the highway to the west of Philadelphia. Only one of the coffee canisters has anything left, and there's chaos at the breakfast sandwich counter. The workers look panicked and I decide this must be a Labor Day rush for which they were unprepared. We grab the last remaining breakfast sandwich sitting out on the counter to split and get back on the road. It comes to $5.75 but my boyfriend pays.

We both get shakes \u2014 his is chocolate, mine is malted chocolate \u2014 and are very happy we took the detour. It's $10, including tip, but my boyfriend pays. 6 p.m. \u2014 After beating the rain to the Poconos, we set up our tent and spend the day catching up with friends around a fire, taking a walk around the \"neighborhood,\" and just enjoying the time without city noise. We all enjoy my boyfriend's amazing food, making tacos from the pork, pairing those with his refried beans, and dousing them in all the salsas. Everyone is (rightfully) wowed. 8 p.m. \u2014 As the rain picks up, we head inside and go late into the night playing board games, drinking wine, and having a good time with good company.

We chat about our plans for the day, which are slightly derailed due to the rain. I help assemble an egg bake, fruit salad, and lay out bacon on a pan for the group breakfast. I'm still full from last night, so I just snag a little fruit and bacon. 12 p.m. \u2014 The rain is constant, but more of an annoying misty drizzle than full raindrops. Several of us decide that we'd get wet kayaking anyway, so we are going for it. Our crew drives to a nearby lake and we spend the next couple hours paddling, eagle spotting, and (successfully) trying not to flip. While we are on the water, the rain clears and we are all thrilled. My boyfriend pays for our $10-day permit. Advertisement 3 p.m. \u2014 Between a small breakfast and lots of paddling, I am starving. The rest of the group is, too, so we find a local Italian place and eat a late lunch. I have three cups of tea because I am freezing, but also a cup of soup and a veggie pasta dish. My boyfriend pays ($55) for our and his friends' kid's lunch. 7 p.m. \u2014 No rain means outdoor grilling! Our friends marinated ribs and there are also chicken wings, corn on the cob, potato salad, and cucumber salad. Our crew does not do small meals. After dinner, the kids want to try and make funnel cakes, so my boyfriend and I take on the task of pouring the batter into the hot oil. They turn out remarkably well, and the kids are all thrilled with their \"carnival food.\" 10:30 p.m. \u2014 Another night of socializing around the fire, but this time we don't get rained out.

The granola bar wasn't enough and I'm in a hangry rage. Thankfully, we see an exit with a Cracker Barrel. Their chicken and dumplings are too good to pass up! Since we have Dragon with us, we order take-out. Pro tip: You can order take-out and eat al fresco on their rocking chairs and it's delightful! I'm a sucker for their general store and buy Badger Sleeping Balm ($6.99), chocolate covered coffee beans, and chocolate covered marshmallows.  $43.64 9 p.m. \u2014 We arrive at the Super 8 and get their last pet-friendly room, but unfortunately, there are two double beds. That means my husband gets his own bed and Dragon and I share. Dragon refuses to sleep alone.  $114 Daily Total: $173", "day_five": "Day Five: 8 a.m. \u2014 Uh-oh.

It's my lucky day because they accidentally give me two!  $7.17 9:15 a.m. \u2014 Our canoe trip will take around five hours, so we stop by Subway for sandwiches for lunch later. I make my own salami and veggie creation and grab chips.  $10.25 Advertisement 10 a.m. \u2014 We've got our canoe rented and loaded up. We strap on Dragon's lifejacket and off we go! Dragon swims like a rock, so he loves the safety of the canoe. The river is so peaceful and quiet. It's pretty chilly and early, so there's no one out but us.  $100 12 p.m. \u2014 We pull up to shore to let Dragon run around in the woods and eat lunch. Dragon goes nuts racing everywhere and splashing in the river. It's too frickin' cute. 3 p.m. \u2014 We are off the river and headed home. My husband saw that we passed a Dairy Queen on our way here and wants to stop for ice cream. It's cold, so I order a hot fudge sundae and a small vanilla for Dragon.  $8 3:15 p.m. \u2014 There's a DIY car wash next to DQ and our car is in bad need of an interior and exterior cleaning. We load up on quarters and I go hard on cleaning.  $20 6 p.m. \u2014 We're back in Brooklyn, surprisingly sunburned and sore-armed from paddling. We order Chinese food and work on a puzzle.

There must be something to this interval training. 9 a.m. \u2014 We own our house and my husband and I have been slowly renovating it ourselves. Right now, we are tiling our bathroom. The tiles for our shower floor are too big for our shower slope so, we head to Home Depot. After much searching, we find the perfect-sized marble mosaic hexagons. We pick up a few more supplies and head home.  $206 12 p.m. \u2014 My husband and I argue about the placement of the tile for a while before we start making the cuts. If we don't get the shower right and end up with leaks, we'll be screwed out of all the time and money we've already put into it. Finally, all the floor tiles are dry-laid. 8 p.m. \u2014 We are tired from the weekend. We decide to stay in and order dinner. There's a Thai place I'm obsessed with even though it's kind of pricey. We order pad see ew and basil chicken.

The beautiful thing about working from home is that I get to make my own schedule and wake up as late as I want. I am a night person, so this works perfectly for me! 11 a.m. \u2014 Still in my PJs, I settle into my home office for a productive day of writing. Today's assignment: the 10 hottest vegan spots in Miami. As I research the topic online, it dawns on me that I haven't been to most of these places! Time to tap into my PR contacts and see if I can score some free media dinners in exchange for coverage. I know this is not the most ethical approach to journalism, but the publication I work for doesn't cover my food spending, so I have to be resourceful to avoid spending all my budget on eating out. I email a few PR peeps and hope for the best. 1 p.m. \u2014 Start to get hungry, and I head to my fridge to consider my options. Even though I know a lot about food, I cannot cook to save my life, so my meals at home are pretty basic and, for the most part, healthy to counterbalance all my dinners out. I make a salad with arugula, feta cheese, tomatoes, bean sprouts, cauliflower rice, and canned tuna, and have a coconut popsicle for dessert. Advertisement 1:15 p.m. \u2014 Mid-salad, I realize that I'm late for a phone interview with a chef for a big article that I'm working on. D'oh! As the reminder pops up on my phone, I scramble to put some questions together before calling the guy. I remind myself that this is Miami, and people are rarely on time for meetings anyway. 1:35 p.m. \u2014 Well, that was awkward! The chef barely gave me any details on his new restaurant, other than the info that is already shared on the website. My editor is going to be pissed, as she wanted to get the scoop beyond the facts on the press release. I'm probably going to have to go speak with him in-person to get more deets. 3 p.m. \u2014 Spend the rest of the afternoon working on my vegan story, leaving the dish recommendation portion blank for now. I get a response from a PR girl agreeing to set up a free media dinner in exchange for coverage. Score! I immediately accept and schedule it for tomorrow at lunch. 5 p.m. \u2014 Gym time! I take a spinning lesson with a friend, and she convinces me to grab a drink after at a Spanish restaurant nearby. 6:30 p.m. \u2014 Despite my best efforts to only have one glass, I end up getting three big glasses of sangria plus a few appetizers. Hey, at least they're on the happy-hour menu.  $25 8:30 p.m. \u2014 I drop off my car at my friend's place nearby and take an Uber home. There is no way I'm driving after all that wine! Plus, Uber just launched a new flat-fee promo, so I pay only $10 for the activation fee, and get $5 rides for the rest of the month! This is the perfect deal for me as I tend to drink a lot when I eat out, and it's way safer than driving myself.  $15 Advertisement 9 p.m. \u2014 After that drinking, all hopes of having a productive night of writing go out the window. I settle in on the couch and watch season 2 of  Master of None . 12 a.m. \u2014 Time for bed!

I see that one of them has covered a story I'm supposed to publish next week. Ugh! I hate it when that happens. I email my editor and suggest postponing my story by a few weeks to keep me from looking like a copycat. They better not write one on vegan spots, or all of yesterday's work will have been for nothing. 11 a.m. \u2014 Quick shower and then I start getting ready for my media lunch at the vegan spot. Luckily, I'm allowed to bring a plus one, so I invite my best friend to join me. 12 p.m. \u2014 I Uber there since my car is still at my friend's house.  $5 12:30 p.m. \u2014 The vegan spot is fabulous! The food is creative, the portions are generous, and the whole meal is surprisingly filling (which rarely happens at these kinds of eateries). We order jackfruit tacos, edamame cakes, a bean burger, gluten-free pizza, grapefruit mousse, and wash it down with smoothies. I take notes on my cell phone of all my faves. The chef comes out to greet us and share a bit more about the concept behind the restaurant, giving me some great info for my article. We finish most of the meal and take some to-go for later. Although the meal is free, we leave a generous $40 tip. I pay in cash, and my friend immediately Venmos me her share.  $20 Advertisement 2:30 p.m. \u2014 My friend drops me off at home, where I sit for several hours of writing. 6 p.m. \u2014 Uber to the gym for another spinning class. I meet my friend again, but we skip the drinks this time and head directly to her place to rescue my car after the workout.  $5 8 p.m. \u2014 Snack on some of my leftover gluten-free pizza from today's lunch. It tastes ever better cold! I scramble some eggs and call it dinner. 9 p.m. \u2014 Watch a few more episodes of  Master of None , while I text with a cute Puerto Rican guy from Tinder. We've never met in person, but I invite him to a media dinner I have on Thursday. I don't normally like to do this on first dates (I would prefer for the guy to wine and dine me, versus the opposite!) but it's at a romantic Italian restaurant, and I can't resist. 11:30 p.m. \u2014 Bedtime.

I celebrate by munching on a chocolate-peanut butter KIND bar from my pantry. 10 a.m. \u2014 A few more PR people get back to me about my vegan restaurant outreach. One of them extends an invite for a media dinner, but the other declines, saying they are not doing any media promotion at the moment. I guess I will not be featuring them in my story! I delete their mention from my Microsoft Word document, and schedule a dinner at the other place for this Friday.

I pair it with quinoa and salad. 2:30 p.m. \u2014 I receive an email from my editor in New York following up on my chef interview. I buy some time but promise to submit it by tomorrow, which means I'll have to drop by the restaurant today to get the scoop. I call the restaurant, and it looks like the chef will be in for the afternoon, so I let them know I'll be coming by for \"photos\" and more questions. 3:20 p.m. \u2014 Make it to the restaurant and get to meet the chef in person. He is way cuter than his headshot, and friendlier than he was over the phone. I ask a few questions and the conversation is flowing nicely. He makes a few jokes and offers to let me try some of his dishes. I don't oppose. We share yellowtail ceviche and grilled octopus over jokes about Miami restaurant clich\u00e9s. I get a slight suspicion that he might be flirting with me, but I keep it professional. I do my tasting, get my answers, and head home. Of course, I give him my business card at the end so the ball is on his court now... Advertisement 4:30 p.m. \u2014 Feeling inspired back at home, I finish the article in a matter of hours. I submit it to my editor for review, and hope she likes it, since she's been pestering me about this thing for days now. 8:30 p.m. \u2014 I'm not very hungry after my mid-afternoon ceviche, so I munch on fresh strawberries and yogurt as I watch an old episode of  No Reservations  on YouTube.

She really liked it! What a relief. The story gets published and gets some great comments from readers on Twitter. Yes! I close my laptop and decide to call it a day. 7 p.m. \u2014 I start getting ready for my hot date.

Starting to get butterflies in my stomach!  $5 8 p.m. \u2014 OMG, he is freaking hot! Tall, dark, and handsome, just like I like them. He is also funny and smart, and we have a great time. I try to show off by schmoozing with the chef and ordering almost every item on the menu because, after all, that's what media tastings are for! We order several rounds of cocktails, and by the time we get to the tiramisu, I'm quite tipsy. The dinner is comped, but he offers to pay for the tip, which I accept. 11 p.m. \u2014 My date drives me home and asks if he can come over, which I don't oppose. I don't usually do this on the first date, especially with people I've met online, but I feel a bit of a connection with him, and the whole night has been so perfect. I feel I would regret it if I didn't! We cuddle on the couch and watch some comedy shows on Netflix, and then proceed to have a steamy make-out session ... and a little more.

I blame it on the wine, and the sexy guy who kept me up all night. I make a smoothie, a coffee, and keep an eye on my phone to see if I get any texts from him. 2 p.m. \u2014 Still no text, but I do get an email from the chef I interviewed earlier this week, thanking me for the article I wrote. He wants to show his thanks by taking me out to dinner this weekend, so I guess he was flirting with me after all! 2 p.m. \u2014 Join a webinar on how to take food pictures on your iPhone.

Part of me scolds myself because I knew buying a luxury car would mean I'd have higher maintenance costs, but part of me also hopes I can leave unscathed. A girl can dream, right? 8:15 a.m. \u2014 Drop off my car at the dealership. It's my 20,000-mile maintenance service, so it's a rough cost. Ouch. Yes, I will help myself to all the coffee and muffins at this price.  $506 9 a.m. \u2014 Like a newbie, I assumed the service would take an hour or two.

People-watching at this bar is the best. There's usually a flock of \"Marina\" guys wearing loafers and spewing the dumbest pickup lines to every girl in the bar. We order another round, and I stick to a gin martini this time. (My mom still can't believe gin is my drink of choice. \"But it tastes like Pine-Sol.\" Love her.)  $14 4:30 p.m. \u2014 We are both oddly tired for a Saturday in the city and decide to pick up another bottle of ros\u00e9 and head back home, with heads held high that we made it out and were social at all. Sometimes a Saturday with  Orange is the New Black , a bottle of your favorite wine, and a best friend is just as fun as bar-hopping.

I'm obsessed with this little town and like to pretend I live there. Unfortunately, it's one of the most expensive cities in the U.S. Being the independent lady that I am, I offer to split the bill but he politely refuses and pays for brunch.

I'm a spicy cabernet sauvignon person, and they are known for their pinot noirs. My boyfriend suggests we buy a bottle of wine to drink in the future. He pays for the tasting and the bottle. I relish those times when chivalry isn't completely dead. 5 p.m. \u2014 We head back to my apartment to crack open the bottle and watch a terrible sci-fi movie we both enjoy. Awful, silly movies are my forte. 10 p.m. \u2014 I kiss the boyfriend goodbye, and he heads home. He leaves for Beijing in the morning, and I crawl into bed with my cat.

We spend time cleaning the apartment and then head to brunch in the neighborhood. As neither of us is in the mood to wait, we get there as they open at 11 a.m. I order a delicious leek and ch\u00e8vre scramble that comes with a side of baby lettuce and toast.

I recently switched from coffee to matcha to help heal a few skin issues, so I resist a latte and order matcha and water on ice (yawn).

The tortilla is delicious cold and I wish I could eat it all. I leave the rest for J., and leave to take the train to work. My commute is about an hour long, and usually I use that time to get some work done, but today I read a little bit more of a book I've been \"reading\" for months. 12 p.m. \u2014 It's lunchtime and I'm hungry! The veggies and grilled chicken I made yesterday are good but scarce, and I'll have to add something else to tomorrow's lunch.

I power through the rest of the day and leave as soon as I can, taking the train home and playing around on my phone.

After, I change into gym clothes and walk to the gym, three blocks away, for a HIIT class (a.k.a., the last thing I want to do right now). 7:30 p.m. \u2014 On the way back home, I check the mail and see I've received a $34.25 check for a bag I sold online! I shower and relax a bit before bed, noticing that my precious skin products are running super low \u2014 that means an expensive purchase is lurking.

I'm proud of myself for resisting the urge to spend. 4 p.m. \u2014 I'm home now and starving because lunch was so early. I make toast topped with olive oil and sea salt to hold me over until dinner. I need to pick up some supplies for work from the education store, so I make it a quick trip and grab Velcro dots, name tags, a plan book, borders, and charts. The DOE is giving teachers $250 to spend on supplies this year so the money I spent here will be expensed as part of that.

I slather strawberry jam onto another piece of the baguette while J. makes coffee; the smell is intoxicating. I resist, make my usual matcha, and note that my collagen powder is nearing its end.

I figured it's worth a shot and take the train two stops into Chinatown. By the time I get there, they've closed the list because too many people have shown up. I'm bummed until I see they're also giving out free, healthy lunch bowls. I snag a soba noodle bowl and a can of lemon seltzer, and stuck it in my bag for when I got hungry later. Now, it's time to go shopping. 1 p.m. \u2014 With the arrival of a new season coming up, my list of clothing \"needs\" is super long. At the top of it: black booties. Last year, I went through the season wearing a cheap and uncomfortable pair that I only sort of liked. I think I waited too long to buy them and there was nothing left. This year, I'm determined to find what I want \u2014 and early. I spend time online and at various stores with no luck. During a quick Instagram scroll, I finally stumble across a pair I'm into.

I love it and decided to order buy it with store credit I have from them from a previous return. 7 p.m. \u2014 After heading back to BK, I meet up with J. at a bar. I'm not in the mood to drink and just order sparkling water while he has a couple of beers.

J. and I enjoy cooking and experimenting with new ingredients, and I've found that having a good lunch at work really makes a big difference in my days. We make four lunches of meatballs with cranberry beans, roasted eggplant, and carrots, and east some for a late lunch/early dinner. 6:30 p.m. \u2014 When the laundry is ready ($26), we pick it up and stop for one last treat. We each get two scoops of ice cream from a shop directly across the street. The flavors are seasonal and delicious and I don't regret my decision one bit ($15).

This combo probably looks pathetic but IDGAF \u2014 it's so yummy. Drink office herbal tea. 12:30 p.m. \u2014 There are candidates in the office for a lengthy interview process, and lunch is being provided. I grab salad, take half a grilled veggie wrap, and pick the cheese out of half a portobello wrap. I also snag the leftover salad for the my base of lunch greens for the rest of the week. 5:30 p.m. \u2014 Head to a NYFW show for an evening wear collection in Midtown, right near my office. I spy Jamie Foxx and Marlon Wayans in the front row. I leave the show early because the clothes look like prom dresses, and I have a second show right after. I take the subway to the Whitney. 6:05 p.m. \u2014 This show is a disorganized disaster. I have a priority RSVP and am told (along with 15 other people) to stand in line with the standing room crowd. Very annoying to go through the trouble of securing an RSVP, only to wait with people who don't have an invite. I manage to get an okay seat in the back and enjoy the energy of the collection. Advertisement 7:30 p.m. \u2014 Eat the chana saag I made Sunday for dinner, and chocolate PB2 I order in bulk from Amazon with cinnamon from Costco. Later as a snack, I have some of the Lindt dark chocolate I buy at Lot Less \u2014 only $1/bar! 9 p.m. \u2014 My friend comes over to pregame. We drink vodka and Monsters that I have leftover in my fridge. (Never again. I'm a Red Bull girl.) Then we then take the subway to meet our friend in the Meatpacking District for a NYFW party. 11 p.m. \u2014 A bartender I know gives me a free drink (#networking?). I contribute $6 towards my group's tip for three drinks.  $6 1:45 a.m. \u2014 I hate taking UberPool when it is late, but I had a month of flat-fee Ubers thanks to a special offer, and now my heart sinks when I see the true fare prices. I risk the Pool (it is Tuesday, at least), and luckily there is only one pickup, two cool-looking Russian guys. The drinks hit me and I sleep nearly whole ride back to Williamsburg.  $11.54 2:15 a.m. \u2014 Take off my makeup with coconut oil and put myself to bed after drinking a liter of seltzer.

I buy five bananas and two pints of blueberries from the fruit cart outside ($5).  $27.12 1 p.m. \u2014 I combine the salad from yesterday with lentils and avocado. I also add in pasta salad from yesterday's office lunch, blissfully ignoring the dairy lurking in the pesto. 4:30 p.m. \u2014 Team bonding with my company! We walk to a boxing studio in Flatiron. I haven't boxed in ages, or really done any sort of intense activity due to an injury, and I'm pleasantly surprised at how well my hamstring has recovered. Class is super sweaty, and we get to leave work early! 6 p.m. \u2014 Why, Q train,  why ? I wait 20 minutes during rush hour for a Q to take me to the Upper East Side to meet my friend at the Met. Her train is also delayed, so we both arrive 20 minutes late. 6:50 p.m. \u2014 My friend is a member of the Met and invited me to a scavenger hunt in the Egyptian section! We listen to a talk about the Temple of Dendur, and there's an open bar with light snacks. I'm starving and help myself to handfuls of roasted peanuts. Our team wins a photo contest, thanks to my  brilliant  human pyramid idea (with one team member posing as a mummy). We receive erasers shaped like \"William,\" the Met's hippopotamus mascot \u2014 and bragging rights. Advertisement 8:30 p.m. \u2014 We mingle with some of the other attendees and try to decide on a place for dinner. I'm not impressed with the vegan selections of the chosen restaurant, so I decide to head to the train and go home. 9 p.m. \u2014 I eat a southwestern veggie burger with avocado, cilantro, nutritional yeast, and salsa, courtesy of my fridge, and watch  Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire  while I eat. For dessert, I eat a bunch of Noor dates ($16.10 for 3.5 pounds on Amazon!) and a nectarine. 11 p.m. \u2014 Wash my face, slather my skin with coconut oil, take my probiotic, and ditz around on my phone in bed until I fall asleep.

In a pursuit to keep my conversation and listening skills up, I listen to France Inter radio. I take the subway to work. 9:20 a.m. \u2014 Breakfast is a sliced banana, half a pint of blueberries, chia, flax, and hemp hearts. I wash it all down with chamomile tea. 2:30 p.m. \u2014 Fix myself lentils, avocado, and salad for lunch, and snack on baby carrots and dates. Dates are my weakness. Advertisement 5:45 p.m. \u2014 Take the subway to the UES for a Gucci beauty event at a townhouse. I get there at 6 but nothing is set up or ready, even though the event is slated for 6-8 p.m. A few people trickle in, looking awkward and confused as the staff explains that things won't start until 8. The whole production looks bootleg, so I bounce. 6:15 p.m. \u2014 Attempt to take the F to the Lower East Side, but because an entrance is closed, there is a literal mob on the platform. I make my way back to the N/Q and switch to a D train...with no air conditioning. 7 p.m. \u2014 I finally get to the LES where I'm meeting a friend for dinner at a vegan Mexican restaurant. We nix our plans for ceviche, and order a tower of delicious, gooey, cheesy nachos. I order a cucumber basil vodka drink and mushroom tacos. We share a banana caramel tart; delicious!  $45.16 8:10 p.m. \u2014 We split an Uber to the East Village to meet another college friend for drinks.  $5.35 8:20 p.m. \u2014 Quick stop at Duane Reade for a pack of gum to cover our Mexican food breath!  $1.75 8:45 p.m. \u2014 We're disappointed to see the hot bartender we love to poke fun at is no longer at the bar. After another vodka soda, we realize that Hot Bartender got a haircut and was completely unrecognizable!  $12 10:15 p.m. \u2014 I take the subway home, where I make some seltzer and do my usually wind down.

Drink a cup of green tea for a boost of energy. 12:30 p.m. \u2014 Grab my headphones and go to meditate in the park for 20 minutes. It is a beautiful day, and I roll my dress straps down to soak up the sun. 1:30 p.m. \u2014 Lunch of salad, avocado, lentils, and pasta salad. 3:45 p.m. \u2014 A \"little more\" pasta ends up being about a full serving, and I am now very full. 4:15 p.m. \u2014 I go on Amazon to order a sports bra and leggings; a friend is going to make me a custom outfit with vinyl details. She's made some cool pieces so far, and I'm dying to get a set made. I order multiple sizes and styles, and end up with four pairs of leggings and a longline bra. I will return two or three pairs after I try them on.  $74.03 5 p.m. \u2014 Take the subway home, talk to my mom on the phone, and then head back into Manhattan to meet a friend. 7 p.m. \u2014 Meet my friend at his boyfriend's office in Times Square. In this area, the two-block walk from the train is like walking through Purgatory. Advertisement 8:30 p.m. \u2014 We just miss the W and take the R into Queens. From there, I call an Uber to a beer garden in Astoria where we are celebrating our friend's birthday!  $11.96 9:30 p.m. \u2014 I put a vodka soda and strudel for the birthday girl on my friend's tab. He says he will Venmo me later, but I tell myself to remind him later, since he never remembers to charge me. 10:45 p.m. \u2014 I walk to another bar in Astoria to meet a friend who just got off work. He knows the bartender here and orders me a vodka soda. I talk to a cute guy, but he's super shy, can't seem to make conversation, and eventually excuses himself. 12 a.m. \u2014 Ugh, why am I going into the city? We take get in an empty subway car back into Midtown (perfect for a group DIY \"Showtime!\" performance) and meet a friend in Hell's Kitchen. I've been drinking so frequently this week that I don't even want another drink. I dance with all the boys, and decide to bounce after they head to a bar more than 10 blocks away.

I am making a vegan Alfredo sauce for a birthday dinner that my brother's girlfriend is throwing. I also make edamame spaghetti.  $10.48 3:45 p.m. \u2014 I take the subway into Manhattan to meet my parents. We have free passes to the Affordable Art Fair, where there is an amazing collection of works! My mom looks into purchasing a few pieces, but ultimately goes home without them to think it over. I realize that the definition of \"affordable\" here is subjective, and I stick to gawking. 5:30 p.m. \u2014 Head to a coffee shop with my parents to hang out. My mom gets me an iced tea, and I help eat her donut. After, I take the subway back to my apartment. 7 p.m. \u2014 Take the subway to Fort Greene, weighed down with sauce, pasta, olives, natural cider, and a few items (yogurt and tuna) I'm giving to my brother, since I no longer will be eating them. As I'm struggling with my huge bag, a girl cuts in front of me and stops short to call me a bitch for bumping into her. Stay classy, NYC. 7:40 p.m. \u2014 Carry the huge food bag up the third floor walk-up. There is a great turn out! We drink wine and the cider I brought, and there is more artisanal cheese than anyone knows what to do with. I snack on grapes and pecans instead. Sigh. Cheese. I need to find a solid vegan substitute ASAP. My brother's girlfriend serves linguine bolognese and the vegetarians eat my vegan Alfredo creation with edamame noodles. There is also a chocolate coffee cake with cream cheese frosting. I try to eat fig jam on crackers, but I succumb to a small slice, dairy be damned. I never miss meat, but I can't say no to dessert!

I also steal the leftover veggie pasta, since there is a ton of meat pasta left \u2014 not to mention cheese. 1:30 a.m. \u2014 I've been texting a boy throughout the night and we made plans to meet up in Williamsburg later on, but nothing materializes. He tells me he's too tired to stay out and is heading home. Sigh. I do my usual ritual and go to sleep.

I'm always starving in the morning, but I hate breakfast foods. I eat some leftover dan dan mian from takeout a few nights ago. Manage to take the bus/Metro all the way to work, which is impressive for a Friday. I have a new-ish job, but I still have so much money on my SmarTrip card from my old employer that I don't pay attention to how much my commute costs. (Depending on the route I take, it's somewhere between $8 - $10/day, roundtrip, which seems expensive since my old commute used to cost $4/day, roundtrip. I still contribute to my SmarTrip, but sometimes I take an Uber or Lyft to the Metro.) I debate getting a coffee until I remember that I have a green juice at work provided by my employer provided (not typical). I try to drink coffee only once or twice a week anyway. Plus, I'm going on vacation in a few weeks, and then again in six months, and I'm saving for elective surgery. 8:45 a.m. \u2014 I'm waiting for my new iPhone to arrive, so I order a case, a screen protector, and glass screen cover.

I eat plantain chips from my snack drawer and two fun-size candy bars that I got from a coworker. I keep a full snack drawer because TBH, I'm always hungry. But my supply is dwindling and I need to go grocery shopping this weekend. 12 p.m. \u2014 Finally lunch! I'm taking one of my coworkers to lunch for her birthday. I try to bring my lunch Monday through Thursday. We go to a BBQ truck, where I order a pulled pork sandwich (it comes with chips), and I add collard greens. I've been getting my vegetables from juice for the past two days, and I'm craving something healthy to counteract everything else. My friend gets a platter with ribs, wings, and fries.  $25.45 2:15 p.m. \u2014 I need an evening bag for an upcoming event. The one I have is basic and gold, but I need a silver-ish one. I end up only being $11 away from free shipping, and since shipping is $6, I look for something else to buy. I know that's how retailers get you to increase your average order value, but I don't care. I could always use another purse, but don't want to spend that type of money. I add a hand chain for $12. Since I hadn't registered online (I've only bought from this retailer in store), I get $15 off a $50 purchase \u2014 and it doesn't charge for shipping when the price is reduced. The entire order is cheaper than the purse alone.  $38.25 Advertisement 4 p.m. \u2014 Yay! Time to leave work. I love my job, but this week has been tough. I head to a nearby salon for my monthly Brazilian. I meant to schedule it for closer to my trip, but oh well.  $72 5 p.m. \u2014 Head to a store that has my hard-to-find soap and chocolate. Buy that, plus toiletries, and wine. After that, I grab a cauliflower curry bowl from a fast-casual place I love ($10.10). They don't have an app, which is annoying, because I like earning points and free food. I almost never visit fast-casual places that don't offer that, but I don't go to this one often and it's nearby. I take the bus home to eat dinner and drink wine before my friend with benefits arrives. I haven't seen him in a while. It's a really great set-up because I'm not interested in dating, and neither is he, and we are truly good friends. I always have fun with him, plus he helps with things around the apartment. Win-win.

I love doing it. I'm going to a beer festival in Maryland, a free outdoor simulcast of  Aida , and a nighttime street art exhibit. Advertisement 12 p.m. \u2014 Eat some leftovers from a Dominican restaurant I went to with a friend a few days ago. I love international cuisine, in case you couldn't already tell. 1 p.m. \u2014 Take a bus to Metro, then get an Uber to go visit my friend with benefits. We usually don't see each other twice a week, but he lives somewhat near the beer festival. We talk for a while and catch up because we didn't really talk last night.  $4.92 4 p.m. \u2014 Take an Uber from his place to the festival. I walk around, and grab a beer and ice cream. I love ice cream and there aren't many good places in D.C. for it, so when I see some, I get it. There are fun and funky artisan vendors, but I'm not in the market for anything, though I do enjoy browsing.  $17 7 p.m. \u2014 Take a bus to Metro so I can head to the baseball stadium to see  Aida . The Kennedy Center hosts an annual, free outdoor simulcast in September, and I try to take advantage. I do attend shows at the Center, but they are expensive, so I get tickets through discounted sites. I usually don't do more than two per year. The Kennedy Center is my favorite place in D.C. and I appreciate that they offer free daily performances of dance troupes, singers, etc. I buy a beer and totchos, since I'm hungry and the good eateries aren't open. The totchos are huge, which is good, but I get full fast and have to throw a good amount away. I hate wasting food.  $20.50 Advertisement 8:30 p.m. \u2014 I buy another beer, finish it, and bounce. Operas are long, and I know the story, so I decide to head to the Metro and check out the art exhibits in a different neighborhood. I get there, and the city is lit. There are outdoor performances and art all around. I can't turn a corner without running into something. The vibe is awesome, and it was the perfect night for it.  $10.50 11 p.m. \u2014 Hop on Metro and head home. There's a 30-minute wait for the bus, so I call an Uber.

I can't decide what I want for produce, so I get my usual non-produce items: a green juice, salsa, and tamales.  $30.69 12:30 p.m. \u2014 My friend and I were supposed to go to a festival today, but it's super-hot out and we decided not to. I wake up from my nap and eat one of the tamales, then work on blog posts and job applications. I have an MBA and I'm looking to switch industries. By the time I look up from my computer, it's after 4. I message my friend from earlier in the day to see if she wants to grab a drink at the new beer garden in the neighborhood.

We both get a beer, but she doesn't like the food menu, so we head to a neighboring bar.  $9.80 6:30 p.m. \u2014 Score! This bar has $2 drafts, half-off appetizers, and half-off burgers. I don't go for the draft special, but I do get a bottle of local beer, a chicken sandwich, and we split tots and nachos. It's way cheaper than the other place.

Call an Uber to take me to Metro.  $4.64 6:45 a.m. \u2014 I'm tired, so I order a PSL from Starbucks.  $5.89 7 a.m. \u2014 Get to work, drink my latte, and eat a tamale while I answer emails. By 10:30, I'm hungry. Our weekly team meeting starts shortly, and lately it has been 90 minutes instead of 60. I eat plantain chips and half of a pressed fruit bar from my snack stash. 12:15 p.m. \u2014 I heat up another tamale for lunch and drink the green juice I bought yesterday. Around 3, I grab two fun-size candy bars from coworker. Really wish the candy wasn't so close. Advertisement 4:45 p.m. \u2014 Leave work and take Metro to the grocery store. I stock up on a seasonal flavor of instant oatmeal (six boxes) and travel packs of olives (10 pouches), plus an expensive beer and wine. I also buy chicken thighs, pork chops, tortilla chips, a veggie mix, cilantro, parsley, haricot vert, strawberries, dried mango (two pouches), and popcorn. The store is out of a few things I need, which means I'll have to go back later in the week. I was hoping to buy enough so I wouldn't need to grocery shop again before my trip. I try to keep in mind that I'll be getting dinner out tomorrow, and maybe again over the upcoming weekend, so I don't want to overbuy either.  $88.85 5:30 p.m. \u2014 Uber home because I have three bags of groceries.  $3.93 6 p.m. \u2014 Cook rice and black beans, chicken, pork, and my veggie mix with cauliflower rice I already had. The rice and beans are for breakfast and the pork and vegetables are lunch for the next two days. I snack on chips and salsa while I cook, and then have some chicken and black beans for dinner.

Also, I haven't worked out since last week, so that's probably not helping. I'm out of ClassPass classes, so I will have to use the gym at work because it's too hot to be outside. I walk a lot, but am heat sensitive; if it's above 75, I can't work out outside, which is my preference. I move quickly and am in an Uber by 6:35.  $6.05 Advertisement 7:25 a.m. \u2014 Arrive at work. I packed breakfast, lunch, and snacks.

I'm meeting a friend for happy hour at 5:30, but don't want to be starving when I get there, so at 3:30 I eat an applesauce cup from my snack stash. 4 p.m. \u2014 Leave work and Metro to the mall to meet my friend. We do happy hour at an Indian restaurant and share samosas and naan pizza, plus get two drinks each. Our samosa order was placed incorrectly, so we get free ones to take home.  $26.36 6:30 p.m. \u2014 We're meeting at the mall because I need to do some shopping for my upcoming trip, and she works nearby. She heads home, and I shop, but don't find much. I do get a shirt, some socks, and a water ($1.50). I hate shopping at the mall.  $24.50 7:30 p.m. \u2014 Head to Metro and check five different bus routes. It doesn't seem like any of them will work without me having to wait 40 minutes. I thought I'd need to take an Uber, but when I get off the Metro, a bus is running late, so it works perfectly. Get home and see that I got a speeding ticket in the mail. I'm usually super careful, and I haven't gotten a speeding ticket in 15 years. I'm so mad.

This is great because I'm staying with my best friend, who is having minor outpatient surgery today; now I'll have time to pack some clothes and cook food for my stay and for my remaining weekday lunches. I really don't want to spend money on takeout or delivery while I'm staying with her. I eat the leftover samosas for breakfast, and manage to have enough time to take the bus. I'm still tired though. I have a busy day at work, and it's double-stars day, so I order a PSL.  $5.89 10 a.m. \u2014 Since I ate my samosas around 5:30, I'm starving.

I realized earlier that I didn't make enough food for the next two days of breakfasts, lunches, and dinners. I'll have enough for both breakfasts, but only one more lunch and one dinner. I guess that's what I get for cooking at 5 a.m. My friend isn't going to be out of surgery for a while, so I go to a make-your-own-pizza place and eat there. It has a rewards app, so I'm happy about that.  $10.46 5:30 p.m. \u2014 Get to my best friend's place just as she does. She's doing well. I help her with things around the house and her one-year-old Morkie, which is basically my dog too. (We went through so much to get him.) She lets me do laundry, which means I won't have to pay to use the communal washers and dryers in my building, or add money to my laundry card, which is running low. I get an email from one of my blogs asking if I can attend a tasting next week. I went to two last week, which was great, because that means free drinks and free food, so I can socialize without paying. It's a new place I've been really wanting to try, too. My friend and I watch reality TV and eat pumpkin spice caramel popcorn (because we're basic) until heading to bed at 10.

Get to work at 7 and eat my rice and beans for breakfast. I'm still feeling slightly hungry, so after a while, I eat a handful of olives, too. I come across a receipt for parking. I don't drive to work often even though parking is cheaper than Metro for me; there's gas and wear and tear to consider as well. We have a parking spending account, where we can put in pre-tax money, and get reimbursed for parking. I don't have much taken out from my paycheck for this, but since I do drive sometimes, I figure it's worth it. This is from a month ago, but I submit it anyway to get my $7. I'm hungry around 10:30, so I eat some roasted chickpeas I forgot I had to tide me over until lunch. 12 p.m. \u2014 My office building has a farmers' market every Thursday, and sometimes food vendors come, too. My friend and I walk over, and a Jamaican vendor is there today, so I get a beef patty, then eat my pork and veggies a little later.  $3 4:30 p.m. \u2014 Head to my friend's house. She's doing really well and we proceed to have a repeat of last night, which is fun. We both wish she could drink though, as wine would be great. We eat grilled cheese sandwiches for dinner. I love just relaxing with her and the dog. Tonight is my last night at her place, but we might go to an East African retail pop-up on Saturday if she feels up to it. I pass out at 10.

I have more scheduled than I realized. \u200b10:07 a.m. \u2014 \u200bMy 10 o'clock appointment doesn't show up so I Google how to report missing packages. A big Christmas present this year from my mom was stolen in the mail, which happens a lot in my neighborhood.  I'm pretty bummed, not only for the gift itself (an Apple Watch, which would be really helpful at work) but also because my mom and I have had a strained relationship in the past and her sending me a gift was a big gesture.

When I get home, I call my bank regarding an ongoing issue with a card I paid off seven (!) years ago that is still causing problems. After, I play with the dog and eat a few chocolates. I text a friend to see if she wants to go to the gym but she's busy. Feeling lonely, I also text my ex. I'm not smart. \u200b6:40 p.m. \u2014 \u200bJust spent 75 minutes on the phone with one of the guys I'm seeing, M. I'm not dating seriously because I recently got out of a long-term relationship, but we had a nice chat.

I pull into the parking lot of a fast food place and then make a quick U-turn before I can think twice about wasting more money today. I drive home and make myself sesame garlic beef and cabbage tacos. I put the leftovers in a glass container for tomorrow and go to bed. \u200b11 p.m. \u2014 \u200bI round out my day of irresponsible spending by ordering Stila eyeshadow I didn't get at Sephora.

But I recently applied for a credit card with Wells Fargo and was rejected. I used to be a financial idiot, but I've learned a lot (thank you, r/personalfinance!).

Lo and behold, Discover approves for a different card with a $9,500 limit and better rewards. \u200b12:30 p.m. \u2014 \u200bHead home for lunch and obsessively check my mail again.

For hosting, I get $50 and a $25 bar tab which isn't bad for three hours of (usually) fun work.

I'm going to a planning meeting for the upcoming DSA Women's March, then hang out with one of the guys I'm seeing, C. But as I'm preparing dinner, my roommate collapses into a grand mal seizure. My roommate is epileptic and manages his seizures through medication; this is his first seizure in a long time and it is extremely scary. \u200b5:15 p.m. \u2014 \u200bI call the paramedics as soon as his seizure starts, and for some reason, they send over 11 EMTs. He eventually comes to, slowly, but refuses to go to the emergency room because he can't afford it. It is so fucking frustrating that people are turning down necessary, potentially life-saving medical care because they can't afford to rack up $1,500 on top of already extensive medical debt. I understand his decision, but I strongly urge him to let me take him to the ER like the paramedic advises. He says no, and I respect it.

In the Instant Pot, I make a combination of chicken breast, ranch dip, cream cheese, and cheddar. While that's cooking, I bake bacon to crumble in it later. I also make chicken fajita bowls for work with seasoning, peppers, garlic, onion, and tomato and put that into individual glass containers. I periodically check on my roommate who is wiped out from his seizure. 10:30 p.m. \u2014 My roommate wakes up and I serve him some dinner.

I have a strong urge to eat my feelings. In the past, I would drive to my favorite chicken wing place and spend, no joke, $25 on wings. I'd do that several times a week; it was out of control. I couldn't afford it either, but somehow I spent the money anyway. I'm super tempted to start the habit again but I stay strong.

With this extra time, I head to a bookstore near my job to try and sell some of my books. I've been inspired by the minimalist lifestyle and am slowly minimizing my own possessions. I get $17 from my books. I find a fairly recent book that I've been wanting to read, so I spend $12 of that and pocket $5.

There's a new interactive exhibit at the Berkeley Art Museum, so he and I walk together and meet our neighbors, who have kids the same age, there. We munch on hummus and crackers on our way over. I still have my student ID from a year ago, when I graduated, so I use that and get us in the museum for free. 7 p.m. \u2014 After my nanny shift is done, I head to a donation-based Vinyasa yoga class.

I take a Lyft ($5) to my acupuncture appointment. It's communal acupuncture, meaning you're often in a room with other people who are receiving treatment, so the costs stay low. I only pay $25 per session. It's pure bliss.  $30 12:30 p.m. \u2014 After my acupuncture appointment, I take a Lyft to the YMCA. I do some weights and stretching and then walk home.

Booking the class ahead of time makes me accountable and forces me to go, plus Friday is Full Body day.

The property owner pays someone to detail-clean the building every two weeks, and I often pay an additional $25 to convince them to clean a few things in my own apartment as well.  $25 12 p.m. \u2014 I work at various client sites, which makes for a nice mix. My clients are scattered throughout Utah, and I get to enjoy the perks of the current office space: free lunch! I am sorely disappointed today when I see that it's nachos. I put some rice, beans, and meat on my plate and skip the chips. 9:30 p.m. \u2014 I finally get to go home! I drive the hour back and make myself pork zoodles. After the long drive and cooking, I'm exhausted and head to bed. Daily Total: $25", "day_four": "Day Four: 6 a.m. \u2014 I wake up and head to an Orangetheory class. I've been sick the past two weeks and have not been utilizing my unlimited membership. My legs are going to feel it tomorrow; I can already tell. Advertisement 8 a.m. \u2014 I make a smoothie for breakfast with frozen berries, Macro green powder, orange juice, and spinach, and am in love with my creation. I pack snacks for the day (tomatoes and strawberries) and head to work. 12 p.m. \u2014 The client isn't bringing in food today, so my team and I have to fend for ourselves. We have a \"team lunch\" and go to a pizzeria where I get a small calzone and salad. I feel stuffed full of dough and happy because work is covering the cost. 3 p.m. \u2014 I'm really feeling my lack of coffee since I opted for a smoothie this morning. I make myself a drip coffee using the client's machines and put some honey in it. It hits the spot, and I gear up to work for the next few hours. 6 p.m. \u2014 It's getting late, and I'm hungry again, I'm not leaving work quite yet, so I grab a Fiber One bar from the client's kitchen (they provide a full supply of snackage) and start gearing up for the drive home. 8 p.m. \u2014 I pick up my birth control on my way home from work (100% of which is covered by insurance, woot woot!) and head to my boyfriend's house. I sent him a free subscription to Blue Apron, and he received it yesterday, so we decide to make cod stew, which is surprisingly good! I put the leftovers in a container to take home the next day, since the boyfriend is a baby about leftovers. I drink some wine that's already in the fridge and chat with my boyfriend and his roommates before we go to sleep. Advertisement Daily Total: $0", "day_five": "Day Five: 5:45 a.m. \u2014 My alarm goes off for an Orangetheory class, and I go back and forth about whether it's worth getting up for. Orangetheory charges a $12 fee for unlimited members who are no-shows, making me realize more and more what a high-maintenance gym I've signed up for. 6 a.m. \u2014 I get a flat tire during my drive to class and cannot be more bummed. I call AAA and am informed that they will arrive in about 45 minutes. I feel sad for my car \u2014 and for the $12 I now have to pay to Orangetheory. I wait in my car until help comes. As embarrassing as this is to admit, I have no idea how to change a tire. I feel very \"damsel in distress\" and hate being a clich\u00e9.  $12 7 a.m. \u2014 With the spare now on my car, I text my boss and tell him the bad news. Since I work so far away, I have to go get this thing sorted out now; I can't drive around on a doughnut. The tire shop is nice but takes forever. Then it turns out that the damaged tire can't be patched \u2014 and that I need to purchase four brand new tires, not just two, because of my all-wheel drive.  Why me? 8 a.m. \u2014 I am starving, and there is a grocery store next door. I get a coconut latte from the Starbucks inside and buy a chocolate cake doughnut because I am an emotional eater.  $7 Advertisement 9 a.m. \u2014 My car is finished. I get an alignment done in addition to my new tires, and the bill comes to...$911. I whimper on the inside and put it on my credit card, which is APR-free for another three months. I start making a plan to pay that off over those three months, only to leave the shop and realize that my car is out of gas. I spend an additional $40 on gas, making this the most expensive morning of my life, by far. I feel sad and hate how much adulting sucks sometimes. I go home to get dressed for work.  $951 12 p.m. \u2014 The client is bringing in food today, so although I have only been working since 10:30, I go upstairs to eat. It's a meat-and-rice number with a side salad. 6:30 p.m. \u2014 I'm still at work and feel bad leaving after having arrived so late, but my brother is playing at a little venue tonight and I promised that I would go. I leave work and head to the venue, which is right by my house, and then decide to head home after his set. I contemplate going to my boyfriend's house, but I feel too worn out and moody for company. Daily Total: $970", "day_six": "Day Six: 8 a.m. \u2014 I make it to the gym and back in one piece. These tires make me feel like I'm driving on clouds, or at least that's what I tell myself to rationalize the expense. I make myself another smoothie and put in way too much green powder, so I add a banana. I pack cucumbers, carrots, and an RXBAR and head to get a soy latte.  $3 Advertisement 12 p.m. \u2014 No catered lunch today, so we head to lunch as a team. My boss pays, and I almost die from choking on a stem of cilantro. I excuse myself and am not really in the mood to eat this salad when I get back to the table. I decide to save it for dinner; hopefully it will keep. 6 p.m. \u2014 I eat my salad and it tastes so much better now that my airways are clear! I head into a meeting with my boss, who asks that I stay a little later tonight. 9 p.m. \u2014 I leave work and have to decide which house to go to \u2014 mine or my boyfriend's. I haven't seen him in a few days, but I'm so tired after the long workday, and I'd like to go to my workout tomorrow. He's not happy about it, but I'm trying to get better at standing my ground with things like this. I eat my chicken-bell pepper creation and take a bath.

Feeling stoked, I get ready to go work out. 8 a.m. \u2014 Before I head out, I make another smoothie. I'm out of orange juice, so I put coconut milk in it and go with peaches. This smoothie isn't an epic fail, but it sure doesn't taste as good as the others. I might need to look up some recipes since I'm new to the smoothie game. I grab a banana, almond butter, and an RXBAR. Advertisement 9 a.m. \u2014 I'm on time to work, and today is payday! I quickly distribute my paycheck to rent, car insurance, internet, savings, and my credit card bill. Then I message my friend to see if we're still on for yoga tomorrow. I'm excited for weekend plans, but make a mental note to set aside time to work. If I don't make a plan, then I typically won't follow through. (I get too stoked with all the freedom!) 12 p.m. \u2014 The company orders catering today: pasta and Caesar salads \u2014 eh. I'm not a huge pasta fan (it doesn't make me feel great), but I eat it anyhow, because it is free. 5 p.m. \u2014 Work has dragged today, but luckily, since it's Friday, we get to leave by 5. I opt for this and regret it almost instantly when I end up sitting in traffic for two hours. My boyfriend and I go to dinner with two of his friends. I get a mango margarita, three tacos, and guacamole because I am starved.

{"title": "A Week In Hollywood Hills, Los Angeles On A $0 Salary", "intro": "Occupation:  Medical Student. I just graduated and am studying for the medical boards. Industry:  Integrative Healthcare (Acupuncture) Age:  35 Location:  Hollywood Hills, Los Angeles Salary:  $0. My income is mostly zero. Nothing is consistent at the moment, so my savings (accumulated from working in finance prior to 2013) functions as my income / capital. I previously covered any shortfalls with student loans as I got through school. Currently, I'm at a $3,600 savings balance, or about three month's worth of expenses. Paycheck Amount:  $0. Over the last few weeks, I made about $200 tutoring, babysitting, office temping, doing promotional work for marketing events, and working at farmers markets. This hasn't all been consistent work, so savings have covered most of my expenses like rent and food. My family generously helps me out here and there with expenses like gasoline and sending birthday money. I'm starting a summer job starting soon that will pay around $900/month before taxes. Advertisement Monthly Expenses Housing:  $1,2o0, including utilities, water, trash pick-up, Wi-Fi, etc. I live alone and rent a tiny guesthouse (what would have been the maid's quarters in a house built in 1929).  Health   Insurance:  No health insurance. I pay for all expenses out of pocket. Hopefully I don't get hit by a bus or die, but that's all of us.  Retirement:  No contributions to retirement savings. Monthly Loan Payments   Car:  $240. I owe $2,400. Student loans:  They're not yet in repayment but will be $75,000. Credit card:  $5,000 balance All Other Monthly Expenses   Netflix:  $10 Hulu, HBO GO, and Amazon Prime:  From family. I share my Netflix password with them in exchange. Car Insurance:  $600 every six months. It's almost $700 but I pay in full for a discount, so it works out to about $100/month. Miscellaneous Transport:  About $200, including gas, Uber, Lyft, public transportation, and car repairs. (Included here and in week's expenses due to current varying transport.) Phone Bill:  $100, including $29/month charge for the Samsung Galaxy S7. Gym/Yoga Classes:  Generally about $100. (Again, included here and in week's expenses due to current varying transport.) 1 of 8", "day_one": "Day One: 7:30 a.m. \u2014 Time for yoga class. I try to get to them six or seven days each week; it helps me amortize the expenses of working out. I practice at home as well, and over the last few years, I've usually joined a new gym or studio every month to get a new-student special. My ex used to call me a \"yoga gypsy,\" but I can't justify spending the $100+ price tags for monthly memberships, even if I can get it down to about $4/class depending on how often I go. I try to go with my menstrual cycles: when my cycle is over, I go to a new studio. By the time I get my next period, I'm usually done for the month. I don't like to workout on my period, so I'll do a light home practice on those days. 9 a.m. \u2014 I make Chicory coffee at home in the French press. It's never as good as getting a cup from Starbucks but I can't ever justify buying coffee out for myself. I smear a couple tablespoons of cashew butter (tubs cost $12 at the farmers' market) on an organic banana (these are grown locally in Santa Barbara and I buy them at the Hollywood Farmers' Market for $2/lb.) and sprouted gluten-free toast and call it breakfast. I also drink 32 ounces of H20 from the tap. I'm very against bottled water and plastic in general, and I'm grateful that my house has drinkable water straight from the faucet. 12 p.m. \u2014 I see my therapist, who lets me pay cash for our sessions; I haven't had health insurance since I started graduate school four years ago. Honestly, I feel lucky I haven't had any major issues that urgent care couldn't handle but I don't like living this way. I've been through a lot emotionally in the last year or so with a devastating home robbery, the break-up of a three-year relationship, followed by an intense five-month relationship with a married guy who didn't end up leaving his wife. Not to mention, I finished graduate school in the midst of this personal chaos \u2014 so we talk about a lot. The 47 minutes are never long enough before I'm on my own again emotionally.  $100 1 p.m. \u2014 I wrap up shredded organic chicken with alfalfa sprouts and fermented veggies in collard greens. All of this comes from the farmer's market except for the organic chicken, which I purchased from a local butcher shop, Gwen. (It costs $6/pound and is organic, antibiotic, hormone-free, additive-free, and humanely raised.) I also have half-a-quart of bone broth from Gwen, which they sell for $5 a quart; it's amazing. I pour in a tablespoon of apple cider vinegar and enjoy the slightly tangy, silky broth, and I eat an Asian pear for dessert. I have a chronic autoimmune disease and eating predominately paleo-vegan has kept it mostly under control. I started eating this way five years ago and it changed my life.  $7 4 p.m. \u2014 I make a small latte with my French press and Chicory coffee, adding in collagen powder ($22/tin on Amazon, which lasts about three months), a little organic coconut oil ($10/jar), and some coconut sugar (which I scored from my babysitting clients who weren't into it. They're really generous with giving me food and things, which I appreciate). I blend them in a NutriBullet and savor the foamy goodness of it. Coffee leads to adrenal fatigue so I try not to have more than five cups a week, even though I've already had two today. 9 p.m. \u2014 For dinner, I use Kimberly Snyder's Glowing Green Smoothie as a base and add a banana, pear, celery, parsley, spinach, chia, flax, and goji, about $5 worth of ingredients. I enjoy it after taking the dog for a long walk around the neighborhood and making him cuddle. Then I study with  The Path  playing on Hulu in the background. Daily Total: $107 2 of 8", "day_two": "Day Two: 7 a.m. \u2014 I scramble three large eggs from the farmer's market and discover that one of the eggs has a double yolk, something that feels like a good omen to me. I also saut\u00e9 kale with fermented veggies and sprinkle the whole thing with nutritional yeast. I add in the last ribbons of sliced lox from Wexler's Deli (they're so thin they're translucent). I previously purchased about $4 worth of lox. Eggs are $10 a dozen from the farmer's market, and I get to meet the people that handle the chickens. I grew up nearish to a factory chicken farm, so it makes me happy to not support factory farming. 8 a.m. \u2014 I browse  Chewy.com  to order dog food. I got a 7-year-old Australian Shepherd after my home was violently robbed last year. A friend-of-a-friend is a breeder and knew I was looking for a dog, and ended up giving me this super-fancy, well-trained dog with an amazing pedigree for free. I'm so grateful to her for her kindness. He's expensive to feed but honestly, he was cheaper than getting an alarm system. I priced it out and decided that I'd rather spend $50 a month to take care of an animal that I know will do his best to protect me, than get an alarm that might not do anything. I hate being a \"single parent,\" even to a dog. It's really hard but it's better that I have him; I do feel safer.  $50 12 p.m. \u2014 For lunch, I make a quarter-pound of locally-caught salmon from the fish CSA. (It cost $29/lb., and I got to meet the fisherman at the market!) I cook it with miso and tamari sauce in coconut oil with asparagus ($2/bunch) over brown rice. (The rice totally came from Trader Joe's and cost $5 for a two-pound bag.) I nibble on a sweet, juicy Asian pear for dessert. Those have also come from the Farmers' Market; they cost $3 each. 4 p.m. \u2014 I drink matcha green tea with lemon. I purchased the tea at an Asian market in K-town; $7 for 25 bags. The lemon is from a tree at my friend's Pacific Palisades beach house. I help her clean out her closet, so she lets me help myself to a few lemons off the tree. She's a stylist \u2014 like a mini-Iris Apfel at 35. She always generously gives me clothes (once, she gifted me a pair of dark red Miu Miu heels). I appreciate it so much because she's upped my style game to another level. Today, we hang out at the beach, which is literally across the street from her house \u2014 a home that her grandmother built in the 1920s. The view looks out from the Santa Monica Pier up through the Malibu curve. We roll a couple spliffs and smoke them through the afternoon. 7 p.m. \u2014 I go to a donation yoga class with one of my favorite teachers in Hollywood. He teaches at an old Hollywood club where Charlie Chaplin once played the piano. I think about that as I look at the piano onstage. He's playing Pink Floyd tonight as the soundtrack. I float away after feeling like I am looking at the \"Dark Side of the Moon,\" even though it's a full pink moon in April. Later, I listen to Nick Drake sing \"Pink Moon\" on YouTube. Free music on demand FTW, though I do hate the ads. I drive home with the top down.  $5 9 p.m. \u2014 Back at home, it's time for another GGS (Glowing Green Smoothie) with banana, spinach, pear, celery, parsley, kale, and lemon. I also make three eggs with spinach add shiitake mushrooms saut\u00e9ed in olive oil. Then I watched another episode of  The Path  on Hulu. I still use my ex's Hulu account but if I paid for it myself, I'd splurge for the ad-free one. (I mean, come on!) For the one show I do watch on it,  I'll live . Daily Total: $55 Advertisement 3 of 8", "day_three": "Day Three: 7 a.m. \u2014 Make breakfast: green tea with lemon again, plus four eggs, kale, and really amazing bacon ($14/lb.) from the butcher shop. I follow eating with a silent moment of gratitude that I get to eat my own food, and don't have to basically support my ex with my grocery budget. He always ate all my expensive food, so I never had leftovers. Plus, he never chipped in for groceries and made me split meals out with him. Despite always drinking more alcohol than I did, he'd insist on splitting the bill. It's over, but the credit card bills are still with me. Whenever I'm sad about him, I think about how cheap he was and it helps. 12 p.m. \u2014 Lunch is: baby carrots (by which I mean carrots I cut up into small pieces), cherry tomatoes, celery, and half a $5 container of hummus. Hummus is one of those things I know I should make, not buy, but like kombucha and kefir, some things are better bought! I also have a kombucha too. Third Eye Chai is my favorite. 1 p.m. \u2014 I meet a client for tutoring at Punchbowl, which makes the best juices, smoothies, and kombucha in town. My tutoring client pays for a super-clean hardcore green juice ($11), and instantly my skin looks better. Tutoring is $40 for 1.5 hours, and my clients pay cash. 4 p.m. \u2014 I score a guest pass to a yoga studio. Free class! I have made friends with as many teachers as possible to support my practice. Sometimes they can bring me in gratis and I'm always grateful. I hope to cultivate these relationships because as soon as I take (and pass) my medical board exams this summer, I'm going to need patients \u2014 and yogis usually have some sort of pain! I know I need to go to a new studio and some yogi acquaintances just opened one, but it's roughly a 20-minute drive and I don't want to go farther than 15 minutes away. They're having a $40 new-student special for the month and I really like the way they teach, so maybe I'll go there next week. This week, I'll sort out more donation classes and guest passes. 10 p.m. \u2014 I make avocado toast for dinner with radishes on sprouted gluten-free bread. Avocado's are three-for-$1 and I get them at the Farmer's Market. 8 p.m. \u2014 Acupuncture treatment and herbal medicine. I usually feel good immediately and the effects last a few days for sure. I was a ballerina from ages two to 20, which was really rough on my body. The treatments are expensive but worth it, so I try to go at least twice a month.  $100 Daily Total: $100 4 of 8", "day_four": "Day Four: 7 a.m. \u2014 Breakfast is six links of organic turkey sausages (they cost $5 for a package of 12 links), scrambled with three eggs, spinach, and onions \u2014 and coffee! I didn't sleep well. The dog barked all night, and I find out via text from my landlord that his GF's car was been stolen right out of our driveway. Sometimes I question my choice to live in Los Angeles. I live in a million-dollar house in a very fancy neighborhood in the Hollywood Hills, but still. I sigh with relief that it wasn't my car, and that even if they tried, it's a stick shift. 10 a.m. \u2014 Donation yoga at Runyon Canyon. Sunshine, bliss and happiness.  $5 1 p.m. \u2014 Time for a snack/lunch. I make two packets of MSG-free miso soup (4 for $4) with a packet of seaweed ($1.29) and green tea with lemon at home. I buy a few mini-apples from the farmers market, at $7 for two pounds. They're like two bites each and I usually share one bite with the dog.  $4 2 p.m. \u2014 Cultured coconut kefir drink. I only drink half. It's kind of gross but I'm trying real hard with the probiotics.  $4 2:30 p.m. \u2014 I take the dog for a hike in Griffith Park with a hot musician artist dude my stylist introduced me to a couple months ago. At 40, he's age apropes \u2014 but last month, he ran off to Brazil to \"bring a bag back\" to a 19-year-old Brazilian model. I don't ask about it, but I hear though the stylist that it totally went nowhere and now he's hanging out with me again. We talk about art and music, and I feel less crappy about my breakups, but he's not my soul mate. 6:30 p.m. \u2014 We shower and then go to a super swanky, hipster-as-hell vegan Mexican restaurant in West Hollywood. It's definitely a scene and I enjoy a couple margaritas. He gets a CBD cocktail which I try.  Eh . If I'm going to use marijuana at all, I much prefer smoking it to any other way of ingesting it. He doesn't have a car; he grew up in NYC and lived in San Francisco for a few years before coming down to LA. I'm not sure if he knows how to drive. He pays for the Uber there but I get the one back and go directly home by myself; I'm not feeling it. I can't get the Brazilian child model out of my head.  $10 12 p.m. \u2014 I drop off laundry at Fluff-n-Fold. Washing machines aren't all that inexpensive and when you factor in time spent sitting in a laundromat, well, that's one way I justify going to Fluff-n-Fold instead. Plus, laundromats squick me out hardcore. I wish I had a washer and dryer; I've only lived in one place as an adult that had one, and I actually really like doing laundry. It's peaceful. I try to do it at friends' houses when I can, but most of the time I just send what I need done to Fluff-n-Fold for $1/lb.  $24 9:30 p.m. \u2014 I Uber home, snuggle with the pup, and pass out.  $7.85 Daily Total: $54.85 5 of 8", "day_five": "Day Five: 7 a.m. \u2014 Breakfast is chia seed pudding with homemade almond/cashew/hazelnut milk, and steel cut overnight oats and berries. They're not paleo (I'm only paleo-vegan  ish ), but my body likes a little energy here and there, and this is a good start to my day. I have green tea with lemon and then make a turmeric latte with ginger, nut milk, and agave. I'm not feeling amazing after last night's margaritas but I shake it off and get to work. 12 p.m. \u2014 I feed the toddler his lunch of quesadillas with broccoli and chicken with cashew cheese. I love when the families I sit for eats like me. I make $60 for the morning with the kid. 2 p.m. \u2014 Donation yoga in Runyon Canyon. My happy place, as always.  $5 4 p.m. \u2014 I get off the phone with the DA prosecuting the guy who robbed my house. He tells me I need more documentation for the restitution order to submit to the judge. I'm asking for $175,000. My grandmother died and left my family her extensive jewelry collection. It was at my house to sell when a random meth addict wandering around the Hills managed to break into my house. What he didn't steal, he destroyed. I was super broke then, too, and couldn't afford to throw a few hundred dollars out toward renter's insurance each year. If the restitution order goes though, it will help because even if I did have insurance, I wouldn't have had all that jewelry covered. It's all a mess and it's hard to deal with. 9:15 p.m. \u2014 I Uber Pool ($5) down to meet a girlfriend, her BF, and his cousin's buddy's friend, who turns out to be a super-hot, funny, 35-year-old Jewish guy. Did I just meet my future husband? He's great and touches me in a sexy way without being aggro about it. We end up going to a couple bars and the guys pick up all the tabs. I'm psyched about meeting him. My GF and her BF bounce and I invite Hotty McHotty to go to my college BFF's house in Hollywood where it's her boyfriend's birthday and they are having a dance party with cake. They went out to dinner but because of budgetary reasons, I declined and agreed to meet up later for cake. We Uber, Hotty McHotty pays and yes, he totally spends the night once we get back to my place.  $5 Daily Total: $10 6 of 8", "day_six": "Day Six: 6 a.m. \u2014 I kick Hotty McHotty out of my place and scarf down a banana on the way to work. At least a toddler can be handled while wickedly hungover; we watch cartoons. He texts me to tells me he really enjoyed himself and loved meeting me, and even makes plans for getting together again. I text post-game with my college BFF who totally adores him and thinks I've met my future husband. At least this one isn't married and has a real job, unlike one ex, who was a wannabe film director, and my other ex, who is married and has two kids... 12 p.m. \u2014 I share lunch again with the toddler. Today it's gluten-free pasta with organic turkey meatballs and broccoli. That's pretty much the only veggie the kid will eat, so there's a lot of it on the plate for him. I nibble on a Kind bar from the well-stocked fridge and toss one in my bag for later. These people shop at Costco and have their house stocked like a Mormon pantry. I feel like that's the ultimate rich person perk. I used to watch  Cribs  on MTV, and the thing I was the most into was when they opened the fridges. So much bounty! 4 p.m. \u2014 A yoga studio I like is doing $5 drop-in classes throughout April. Namaste kids: This'll probably get me through a couple weeks. Yoga life is kind of hard and requires research.  $5 6 p.m. \u2014 Dinner is a whole quart of Gwen's bone broth spiked with apple cider vinegar, along with spicy ahi tuna pok\u00e9 ($8 for a 1/3 lb.) from Gelson's, which is the closest grocery store to me. Everyone always spots celebs there, but the only person I've seen who means anything to me is Angelyne. I shop there a lot because they send coupons for $5 off purchases of $25 to the house, and I try to never spend more than $30 at a time there. I've made two trip with coupons just to work it. Strategies! I put the tuna over the last of the spinach and arugula from the farmer's market and add in an avocado. Heaven.  $15 8 p.m. \u2014 I study, hang out, walk the dog, and watch Netflix.  Better Call Saul  is back for season 2! I text with Hotty McHotty. I really like this guy; I just feel it. He asks me what I want to do for our date and I panic a little. He's only been in L.A. three months to my 18 years, and I feel like I've got to impress him with my suggestions. There are so many choices here, it can get overwhelming, fast. I assume he's paying (he better!), so I throw out some not-cheap but not-extra-pricy places for him to research. I have my fingers crossed.

Walking around the nearly three blocks of fresh produce and seeing all my neighbors really gives me part of the sense of community I have living in L.A., and I love it. I pick up greens: kale, spinach, chard, celery, parsley, collards, asparagus, mint, and basil ($15). I get a small tub of sheep's milk yogurt ($6), which I can tolerate \u2014 and they have a rose flavor that's divine.

I hop in the shower and get dressed, but end up back in bed. I don't lose any money because this was a \u201cby donation\u201d class and you pay what you want when you check in. I text my boyfriend asking for Gatorade. 2 p.m. \u2014 My boyfriend arrives and he wakes me up. He got Vitamin Water instead of Gatorade. Not the same, but I take a Tylenol and lay back down. 3:45 p.m. \u2014 I'm hungry and so is he. We decide to try a new burrito spot on Seamless.

The job is also walking distance from my house. I definitely make a mental note that I need to weigh the pros and cons if selected.  7 p.m. \u2014 I am home and off the rest of the week!

He only charges us $45 and we split that six ways. My friend's boyfriend covers the tip.  $7.50 2 p.m. \u2014 All of the window shopping yesterday has my whole body aching to spend money. I see some Tiffany sunglasses I really like. They are \"on sale\" for 50% off. I quickly Google the pair and find them for $400. So the sale price isn't really 50% off, more like 40% but I still purchase them because my stepdad had sent me $500 for my trip.

I pay for the crab legs.  $35 1 p.m. \u2014 We sit in a sports bar and watch the game. I wanted to bet on the Packers but I am so glad I didn't. They are losing horribly.

I look into a new shower curtain for our bathroom and we go to bed by midnight. It's been a low-key Valentine's Day but we don't really celebrate V-day!

Everything is delicious and the check isn't as scary as I thought it would be.  $30.90 11 p.m. \u2014 We stop by a friend's birthday party at a bar in the Lower East Side. It's good to show face and mingle with people I haven't seen in a few months. My friend and I order vodka sodas at the bar.  $8.50 12:30 a.m. \u2014 The alcohol isn't making my allergies/cold any better, so I hint to my friend that it's time to head home.

We make tentative plans to meet up after the show. 2 p.m. \u2014 I take the subway uptown to meet my family. 4:45 p.m. \u2014  Hamilton  was incredible and had me in tears! The music was better than I imagined, and the message was so politically relevant. We walk to an early dinner and decide that we need to buy tickets again. (Thanks, Mom and Dad!) 5:15 p.m. \u2014 I'm hungry and the parents are paying, which is a deadly combination. I order a glass of red wine and a burger with fries. We split shishito peppers and artichoke dip for an appetizer and chocolate cake for dessert.

The bike path leads straight to the community center where my boyfriend plays hockey! 11:30 \u2014 Our realtor is out of town, so we walk through the house with the listing agent. The house is a little dingier than what was shown in the photos. The cabinets and baseboards need a fresh coat of paint and so does the deck. The listing also neglected to show that the master suite is in the basement \u2014 but it is huge and the bathroom has a giant shower, soaking tub, and sauna. There is an additional room off the master that I decide can be used as a night nursery down the road, alleviating the need to walk upstairs when we have kids. Advertisement 1:30 p.m. \u2014 My boyfriend and I agree to put an offer in on the house. The listing realtor tells us that the owners purchased it for $350,000 and are looking to get out ASAP, which is why it's listed for $300,000. We agree that some work needs to be done \u2014 painting cabinets, painting deck, landscaping \u2014 but it's nothing that we can't do ourselves. 2:00 p.m. \u2014 I snack on tortilla chips and hummus while making grilled ham and cheese and the rest of the broccoli tots.

We have decided to offer the full listing price, $300,000. 4:00 p.m. \u2014 I grocery shop for the week. I'm very into Albertsons Monopoly and purposely choose products that will get us tickets. I buy the same groceries every week and try to buy organic as much as possible: O.J., yogurt, coffee beans, tortillas, bell peppers, cucumbers, mushrooms, onions, bananas, and a giant box of spinach. I also buy ingredients for beef stroganoff, my boyfriend's meal request of the week, along with a new acne wash and two boxes of Yogi teas that are on sale.

We should receive news on our offer by 5 p.m. but I have not heard anything yet. I'm starting to get nervous. 5:15 p.m. \u2014 I pick up my boyfriend at his office. He has just heard from realtor, and we should receive a counteroffer in a few hours. We spend the car ride home debating what the counteroffer will entail.

I also execute a 60-day sell order on 65 shares of my Chevron stocks. I set the limit for $119/share, the 52-week high \u2014 totaling $7,735.

I usually go grocery shopping once every two weeks. I live alone and I can't fathom going every week. I never make a shopping list, so I wander around the aisles and pick up things while I'm waiting on line. I buy eggs, salmon, hemp seeds, a few fun cheeses, mozzarella, mochi, a burrito, pita chips, gyoza, snap peas, bananas, tofu, salad dressing, grapes, hummus, tofurky, salad, and spinach.

(I have a whole ritual). I clean my floors. I groom my cat, and then I give myself a manicure \u2014 I rarely get manicures because I almost always have my nails painted and can't justify paying $20/week or so to have perfect nails. I do them myself and they're never  quite  right, but they're good enough. I clean my apartment a bit. (I am  forever  vacuuming, thank you, cat.) Then I settle in to try to do some work. 3:30 p.m. \u2014 I eat one of the cookies I bought \u2014 way too sweet for my taste \u2014 so I wash some grapes and munch on those instead. I start prepping for work tomorrow. I work in finance as a trader, so I want to catch up on news that happened over the weekend, anything that will move the markets this week. My cat, after pawing at the grapes that I've just washed and deciding they aren't for him, curls up next to me and goes to sleep. Advertisement 6:00 p.m. \u2014 I finish my most pressing work for tomorrow and make plans with friends for brunch next week. I'm hungry early today, so I cook a quick dinner of Trader Joe's Vegetable Fried Rice. I toss in an extra handful of frozen edamame (it can always use more edamame), add a fried egg, and cut up a piece of Trader Joe's Sriracha Tofu. Time to turn off the TV and hit the books before bed. I'm studying for an exam in a few months and am woefully unprepared. 9:30 p.m. \u2014 My brother stops by (we're neighbors) and brings me a piece of strawberry shortcake from Veniero's since it was my birthday last week. We gossip and catch up for an hour, then it's time to take some NyQuil and pass out. I fall asleep scrolling through my Twitter feed.

My phone says it's 25 degrees out now and it'll be 45 degrees later. How am I supposed to dress for this weather? I grab the bag I packed the night before and my iced coffee in the fridge and wander off to the subway. I cold brew coffee in my fridge since I got sick of spending $5/day at Starbucks. I know if I can get to the subway around 5:05 a.m., I won't wait too long for the train. This early in the morning, the trains only come every 15 minutes or so and my schedule in the morning is too tight to miss this one. The platform is pretty empty but a woman FaceTiming still pushes me out of the way. I get into the office just before 5:30 am.

It's a drag to get up so early but I feel so much better once I'm done. 9:00 a.m. \u2014 I'm barely awake through our research call. The market opens in half an hour, so I duck across the street to the cafe where I buy breakfast: egg whites with broccoli, tomato, and mushrooms ($5.72). I pay in cash, throw the change in the cashier's tip jar ($0.28) and give the guys working the grill a Lincoln.  $11.00 9:15 a.m. \u2014 The only way egg whites and vegetables are tolerable is with a ton of hot sauce, which I keep on my desk. When I first started on the street, I thought the prevalence of hot sauce everywhere was a little overkill; now I can't get through breakfast without it. The trader next to me offers me some trail mix. I eat a handful. 11:00 a.m. \u2014 The morning is really busy but it slows down around 10:30 a.m. I read  Chrissy Teigen's article  in  Glamour  (God, I love her) and then order lunch. Our firm subsidizes Seamless orders up to $11.50, so I order a salmon salad from Leafage which comes to $17.79. It takes me forever to finish my lunch.

I pick up a delivery from Sephora from my doorman and feed my cat. I drink some orange juice and take my Fountain beauty supplement; I have no idea if it works or not. I light a Diptyque candle and take a deep breath. These candles are crazy expensive, but they last FOREVER and smell amazing. I figure I can go through three $30 candles in the time it takes to go through one of these, so it about evens out. 7:00 p.m. \u2014 I do some chores around the house, settle in, catch up on personal emails. I should be hungry, but I'm not. I take some pita chips, hummus, and grapes I bought from Trader Joe's and snack. This means I probably won't eat a real dinner tonight. 8:00 p.m. \u2014 Now that I'm caught up on all my personal things (reading emails, scrolling through Instagram) it's time to study. Studying when you're an adult is awful! I'm not doing real, high-quality studying, either: My sister and I are texting and I'm listening to Chance the Rapper. It's hard to concentrate on calculating bond yields when 1) I really don't want to, and 2) I can think of so many other things I could be doing!

She says the sofas there are cute and great quality; I research online. Advertisement 5:00 p.m. \u2014 I'm at ABC Home and am in love with every sofa. I sit on all of them. They're fantastic!

I text her back and ask her if I can read it in half an hour. I light my candle and preheat the oven. I start catching up on my personal emails.

(He has a motorcycle but it's currently out for repairs.) This gig is a three-day job out of town and I'll have the car to myself for the next few days. He makes us some coffee and I take mine in a travel mug. Advertisement 7:30 a.m. \u2014 I'm back home and hungry; I avoid the strong temptation to pick myself up some breakfast tacos after dropping off my fianc\u00e9 and I eat a bowl of cereal instead. I'm planning on doing some grocery shopping after work, so I try to make a mental note of what I need as I walk around the kitchen with my cereal. My fianc\u00e9 and I adopted a kitten a few months ago, and the kitten got a taste of milk one time and now tries to shove his face into our cereal bowls every day, so this morning I am dealing with it by just keeping the bowl out of his tongue range. 10:30 a.m. \u2014 I've been working on a really boring word-processing project at work and I can't stop yawning. I'm trying to cut back on office coffee, so I guzzle a bunch of water and take a break to stretch instead. 12:30 p.m. \u2014 I have to pick up a couple of packages that were dropped off at a UPS holding station on the UT campus. I feed the street meter 50 cents. The pickup goes a lot smoother than I expected it would, and I have time to grab something to eat. There's a Chipotle right next door, and though I know it is a mortal sin to choose Chipotle over the surfeit of cheap, delicious Mexican food options available in Austin, I'm starving and I need to move quickly. I order a sofritas bowl, pay with the last bit of cash I have left over from a babysitting job a few days ago, and hustle back to my car. I pull into work with several minutes of break time to spare and chow down at my desk.  $7.50 Advertisement 2 p.m. \u2014 The taste of Chipotle salsa lingers in my mouth. I find a piece of Dubble Bubble gum in my purse  \u2014 I honestly do not know how it got there \u2014 and chew it for the five or so minutes the flavor lasts. 5:40 p.m. \u2014 I get home and eagerly rip open the two packages I picked up earlier. I had an intense babysitting gig last week, and used the money I made to treat myself to a couple pairs of new shoes. I'd been alternating between one pair of boots and one pair of clogs for the past six months, so I bought some comfy-looking flats and a pair of casual sneakers in anticipation of spring/summer. I'm disappointed to find that neither pair of shoes fits perfectly. I  hate  returning things, so I decide to sleep on it, try the shoes on again tomorrow, and then decide what to do. 6 p.m. \u2014 It's a cool evening and the sun's still up, so I decide to go for a run. I had started off the new year exercising pretty regularly, but fell off hard once I started my new job. A few minutes in, I start to feel some pain in my knees, so I take it easy and drop to a brisk walk every so often. Once it gets warmer, I think I'm going to get a membership to the Barton Springs Pool so I can switch to swimming instead of running and save my fragile knees.

Breaking them in is the worst part, and I might as well get started on it. 10 a.m. \u2014 So tired. The switch to an 8:30 - 5:30 desk job hasn't been as easy for me as I'd hoped. I start snacking on chocolate-covered pomegranate seeds just to stay awake. 11:30 a.m. \u2014 I print out a return label and bring the shoes to a UPS shipping center for a free return. On the drive back to work, I see so many places that I want to buy lunch from, but I return to the office and heat up my leftovers like a good girl. 6 p.m. \u2014 After what feels like a very long day, I head to therapy. My therapist lets me know as our hour is wrapping up that she'll be leaving the counseling center in a few months, so I can start thinking about what I want my next move to be with therapy. I've been holding onto a psychiatrist's number that my friend gave me months ago, and now that I have health insurance, I think I might make an appointment with her. Seeing a psychiatrist and discussing possible medication options would be a huge step for me, but I've made so much progress in taking care of my mental health in the past year that I think it's a step I'm ready to take. My therapist nearly forgets to charge me as I'm on my way out, but I remind her, because I'm a nerd.  $20 Advertisement 7:15 p.m. \u2014 I'm home and hungry. I still have so much pasta left, and a strong sense of duty not to waste it, so I heat some up for dinner. I'm feeling a little achy and I want to get a good night's sleep, so for dessert, I pull out a bag of gummy candies that some friends from California gave us for Christmas.

I log in to my online banking account and see that I've been charged the full price, even though I canceled my membership last month. I call the studio and it takes them a minute to find the cancelation paperwork I filled out, but the person I speak to assures me that I should be able to get a refund. I'll just have to wait until the manager gets in.  $99 Advertisement 12 p.m. \u2014 My boss asks me to pick up lunch for her, so I take her credit card to a nearby sandwich shop. I really want to buy something for myself, too. I'm so tired of eating this pasta. 12:30 p.m. \u2014 Someone from the gym calls me back. Unfortunately, because I canceled my membership mid-billing cycle, they charged me for this month and can't refund me. The person I speak to tells me that I'm welcome to use their facilities until the end of this billing cycle. Part of me is like,  sure, might as well , but another part of me is like,  it's a trap. Don't give in!  I didn't like the vibe of the gym at all, either, so I've pretty much just thrown away $99. Financial lesson learned: Always read the fine print on any contract you sign, don't be afraid to ask clarifying questions about that fine print, and don't sign any contract just because person pitching it to you seems like a nice lady and you just want to make her happy. 2:30 p.m. \u2014 After a mostly slow week at work, I get slammed with four projects right after lunch.

The bartender there asks me if I'd like to take a shot of whiskey with him, but I'm like,  Dude, my car keys are in my hand right now! 3 p.m. \u2014 I hear from two friends offering potential plans for today, though at this point, with this weather, I feel inclined to stay wrapped in a blanket for as long as possible. One of my girlfriends wants to go to the mall to pick out an outfit for an upcoming event, and another acquaintance from New York tells me he's in town and going out with some of his rock climbing buddies tonight if I'd like to tag along. I don't know if I'd quite fit in with a gaggle of gay rock climbers, but it sounds like a good time. 4:30 p.m. \u2014 My friend tells me she's ready to go shopping, so I pick her up and head to the mall. Nothing at H&M really piques her interest, so I suggest we drive down a street with a lot of thrift and vintage stores and pop into a few to see if she can find anything. (This is also because I kind of want to go thrifting.) Unfortunately, she's just getting over an illness and starts to feel nauseous again, so I pull into a gas station.

I stocked up on groceries in Denmark, so this morning I have some organic oats with chocolate-banana protein powder and peanut butter. I make a cup of instant coffee with a splash of my roommate's milk \u2014 something she would crucify me for if she saw, but luckily she's asleep. 9:30 a.m. \u2014 I walk to the U-Bahn station right outside my house. Not even gonna lie: I fare skip a lot of the time. (German stations don't have turnstiles and my job doesn't reimburse me for transportation.) I would feel terrible about it...except 90% of people I've talked to in Berlin do the same. The train arrives right as I reach the bottom of the stairs, so I bolt toward the door. No fare checker today, thank god. 11:18 a.m. \u2014 I'm starving already, so I have a cup of coffee and a huge orange with some walnuts and cinnamon from our company kitchen. We're a nutrition and fitness company, so raw nuts and fruit are always in excess around here. 12 p.m. \u2014 I recently returned from a monthlong work trip where I had gym access 24/7, so I've gotten more serious about weightlifting and cardio and want to find a good \u2014 and cheap \u2014 gym. Luckily, a music club-slash-gym just opened around the corner from work. I duck in and it turns out they have a free week trial membership! I sign up, peek around the weight room, and make a plan to do a legs circuit after work. Advertisement 12:30 p.m. \u2014 I didn't have time to grocery shop when I got home last night and everything is closed in Berlin on Sundays, so I stop into a discount grocery store to pick up snacks. Turns out they have a salad bar that's .99 Euro per 100 grams! I load up on fresh-ish veggies and get a big piece of roasted chicken. Very pleased with my thriftiness.  $5.20 12:45 p.m. \u2014 I grab a soy cardamom latte at a vegan food stand before heading back to work. Despite being spring, it's still freezing out and I need a warm pick-me-up. I'm from California and justify a lot of my coffee orders with this logic.  $3.20 1:20 p.m. \u2014 The yoga leggings I ordered over two months ago have finally arrived. They were a birthday present to myself and were on sale, but a shipping snafu made me wonder if I'd ever see them in real life. Luckily, they fit like a glove! I also get a notification for another delivery. I assume it's a replacement order from the athletic wear company and make a mental note to collect and then return that package on Saturday. 2:50 p.m. \u2014 Still hungry. Am lusting after vegan cookies from the food stand outside but I stick to an office apple instead. 4 p.m. \u2014 I cave and get a vegan cookie.  $2.13 6:45 p.m. \u2014 I head to the gym after work and start the first day of my weeklong free trial.

We're heading to London for vacation in a week and a half and are still planning logistics. After, I take a shower, pack my gym bag, and paint my nails.

I make a mental note to figure out where to find cheap boxes in the next few days. 12:45 p.m. \u2014 I head out to go see the new apartment in a suburb pretty far out of town. I'm still feeling groggy and a bit hungry so I grab an iced Americano and a breakfast sandwich from the Starbucks nearby.  $6.94 1 p.m. \u2014 I buy roundtrip tickets to and from the suburb. Then I promptly get on the wrong train and have to call the landlord to tell him I'll be way late to see the room.

It turns out that there's a 30-minute wait until the next train to Alexanderplatz comes, so I get a Subway salad, a cookie, some chips and a caramel latte from Dunkin' Donuts while I wait on the platform. The apartment was nice and roomy, but the suburb is about an hourlong commute from work and the building has a super-strict policy on guests staying overnight. My girlfriend likes to come for a week at a time when she has university breaks so we can spend quality time together. This seems like a no-go.  $12.62 Advertisement 6:40 p.m. \u2014 I peek into the neighborhood Lululemon on my way home and try on excessively overpriced leggings. None of them are actually that flattering on me, but a nice sports bra is on sale for $40 and I'm in need. I'm tempted but I'm also broke until my next paycheck so I pass and feebly lie to the attentive saleswoman about coming back later to buy some $180 tights. 7:30 p.m. \u2014 Same dinner as all last week, plus a protein shake. I use up what's left of my groceries and remember that basically all grocery stores will be closed tomorrow so I need to make it to mine before 10 p.m. I also need to switch things up so I don't get ridiculously bored with the same recipes next week. I munch on some strawberries with soy milk while watching  Friends  to procrastinate on getting out of my warm bed. 8:55 p.m. \u2014 I mournfully put on pants and go back out for a last-minute grocery haul. I get pretty much the same thing but switch up the vegetables a little: zucchini, canned white beans, tuna, red peppers, pre-cooked chicken, soy \"ground beef,\" and a chocolate bar with dried fruit and nuts because I want more sweets.

(Craigslist is available in Berlin but almost every housing listing is a scam.) My current landlord has turned out to be pretty conniving, so I'm really worried about getting my deposit back in time to move. Not having savings sucks and was a significant drawback to moving here, but I figure out ways to make it work. Advertisement 2 p.m. \u2014 Have a quick pre-workout protein shake then head to the gym for a 2 hour weights and interval training session. I'm trying to get stronger while also keeping my metabolism in good shape, so I end up spending a lot more time at the gym than most people. I use the new guide I bought on Friday to do a back/biceps workout and am demolished by the end of it. 5 p.m. \u2014 I make myself a huge salad with tuna and beans while also saut\u00e9ing and boiling veggies for the rest of the week. I FaceTime my girlfriend and we chat about summer housing options. It looks like she'll be moving to Berlin for a summer practicum \u2014 !\u00a0\u2014 and we definitely want to try living together for those three months. This means I'll most likely need to look for a more expensive studio apartment from June through September. (Leases run very short here.) I decide that I'll Airbnb for the next month until she has confirmed all of her practicum details and can help pay half of the deposit on a new place for the summer. 9 p.m. \u2014 I get hungry a bit later and I snack on leftover strawberries while I pack up everything I possibly can. My roommate is extremely neurotic about cleaning so I spend an hour or so cleaning the kitchen, then another 45 minutes on our tiny bathroom. I plan on doing a full sweep of everything every day after work this week. That means getting up super-early for gym time, but it's all worth it though.

The minimum payments are about $150/month, but since I'd like to finish paying them back before I reach menopause, I set up automatic bill pay for $200/month per loan.

I'm terrible at motivating myself to hit the gym, so the accountability factor is just as attractive as the price tag. 6:30 p.m. \u2014 I shakily gulp the second half of my protein shake and hop on my bike. I'm concerned I no longer have the forearm strength to grip the brake. 7:30 p.m. \u2014 Thank god I'm home!

I've already called the company to inquire and sent a few emails regarding a possible remedy, but no response. The tracking information says my delivery is indefinitely delayed.

My job is super flexible about working remotely, so I decide to work from home and spend the day with my husband. Since his office is inside the security perimeter for the inauguration, he is also working from home today. 9:30 a.m. \u2014 We do another pregnancy test just to make sure and then I call my doctor. She wants me to come down to their office today for a confirmatory blood draw. 11:00 a.m. \u2014 I almost missed my morning conference calls because I fell down a rabbit hole of looking at different pregnancy sites! This still doesn't feel quite real. I take the metro downtown to my doctor's office. There was no copay for my appointment \u2014 not sure if that's because the blood test was considered preventative care by my insurance or if the doctor's office just did it as a courtesy.

Eight years ago, we walked down to the National Mall in the freezing cold pre-dawn hours, with a multicultural group of friends.

We spend the rest of the afternoon at the mall alternating between marching and chanting with the crowds and trying to catch a break from the mass of people. It's amazing to see all these people, who came from all over the country, streaming onto the Mall, with the metro escalators constantly depositing more and more people.  $4.30 3:30 p.m. \u2014 We are feeling a bit overwhelmed by all the people so we start to walk home.

I can't justify spending $6 on Ben and Jerry's, so I sadly head back upstairs to cook.  $7 Daily Total: $21.69 Advertisement", "day_seven": "Day Seven: 9 a.m. \u2014 I start my morning with coffee from work and a Trader Joe's yogurt.  1 p.m. \u2014 My company is moving offices, so my coworkers and I decide to go to our favorite Thai place one last time.

I'm able to take it easy this a.m., as most of my company's permanent employees are on a retreat. (I am working on a short-term contract.) So instead of rushing out the door, I drink some coffee with my boyfriend, throw cereal and milk into a Mason jar, and grab some random snacks for lunch. 11:45 a.m. \u2014 Snack on a banana that I brought to work, but half of it is too mushy to eat. Now I know I NEED to stop for groceries on the way home. 1 p.m. \u2014 I consider going out for a bowl of soup, but decide to get by on the snacks I brought. I have snap pea crisps (amazing), some cheese, and a Fiber One brownie. As I'm eating lunch, I peruse job boards and send off some networking emails. My job contract is ending soon, so I need to figure out what to do next.  5 p.m. \u2014 I'm crashing hard today, so I make the decision to hit up Costco first on my grocery trip. (Free samples!) I quickly visit the sample stands, and get to shopping. Much easier to navigate this store on a weeknight than on the weekend. I try to only purchase $50 worth of food, but I end up with a few extras.  $68.45 5:45 p.m. \u2014 I head next door to Target to fill in the gaps. I use a Redcard and Cartwheel to make grocery shopping at Target as reasonable (if not slightly more reasonable) than the traditional grocery stores. My boyfriend and I usually split groceries pretty evenly, but lately it has made most sense for me to stop on my way home from Denver. Either he will cover the next round, or more likely, he will spring for some meals and drinks when we go out.  $54.39 6:30 p.m. \u2014 Finally arrive home! I had told my boyfriend how exhausted/hungry I was before I did the grocery shopping, so he brought home some meals from his work cafeteria. He gets them subsidized and deducted from his paycheck each month, and he is behind on using them because of the holidays, so, its a win-win to use them up tonight. I have a small salad and half of a mini pizza, and there are leftovers for the next couple lunches I need to pack. 8 p.m. \u2014 As I unwind on the couch watching  Top Chef  reruns and chat with my mom, she tells me that I should book a hotel for my Grandma's birthday trip to Vegas this summer. They have a block reserved and she wants to make sure I'm in the block. I book for the whole weekend, but they charge a one night deposit immediately. At least I put it on my Chase Sapphire card, so I'll get travel points.  $147.55 Daily Total: $270.39 Advertisement", "day_two": "Day Two: 9:30 a.m. \u2014 I get moving pretty late this morning. It is Friday, my coworkers are at the retreat, and I'm working from home since I have an appointment this afternoon. It is Inauguration Day, so I will surely get more done from home with the TV on mute than I would have at work, constantly checking social media and news sites for updates. Boyfriend brewed coffee hours ago when he got up, so I microwave it and eat cereal with milk again for breakfast. 12:50 p.m. \u2014 I have a 1 p.m. appointment at Planned Parenthood. I'm on Medicaid (I qualified as a student, and my income hasn't gotten high enough to require reclassification), and PP is one of the few providers I can see for an IUD. I scheduled my appointment for today on purpose. Once I am taken back, we decide on Paragard and I also get my third Gardisil shot, which I'd been neglecting to do for years. The procedures are slightly painful, but I feel great that I checked these items off my to-do list. 2:30 p.m. \u2014 As I get back from the appointment, the pain sets in a bit. Watching the Inauguration and getting back to work doesn't really help! I quickly remember to make my donation to Planned Parenthood. I donate $35 for today, and set a recurring $5 donation for following months. I had considered doing this at the office, but the girl at the front desk was on a phone call and I didn't have cash.  $35.00 4 p.m. \u2014 Still haven't had lunch. Boyfriend is home a bit early, and he is willing to make me what I'm craving \u2014 avocado toast with poached eggs. I supplement this \"lunch\" with some of the snacks from yesterday's cafeteria haul. 8:20 p.m. \u2014 Still on the couch. I'm feeling the cramps, and we've both had a long work week, so we decide to stay in tonight, crack open some wine, and make some grilled cheese as a late dinner (while watching more  Top Chef  reruns). Daily Total: $35.00 Advertisement", "day_three": "Day Three: 10 a.m. \u2014 French press coffee at home to start off a lazy Saturday. We had friends in town last weekend, so this weekend is about recharging (and mitigating the cramps I still have). I turn on coverage of the Women's March. I feel a bit of guilt for not going to the Denver March, but it has been a long week and I plan to contribute in other ways. As I check out social media, I'm proud to see so many friends participating. 12:30 p.m. \u2014 Friends stop by to borrow our skis and discuss plans for tonight. We catch up a bit while they're here, and decide on a late dinner. Knowing that we'll be eating late, I whip up a larger brunch \u2014 english muffins with avocado, fried eggs, and turkey bacon. The rest of the afternoon is spent working on the job search while binging on more  Top Chef  on Hulu. I'd planned on getting things cleaned up around the house, but I still feel very accomplished for a Saturday. 5 p.m. \u2014 Can't make it to dinner time without a snack!  Top Chef  has inspired boyfriend to add garlic powder and parmesan cheese to a bag of Smartfood popcorn... it is surprisingly good! 7:15 p.m. \u2014 Head downtown for dinner to meet the friends. We decided on a place that I have a Groupon for, and the other couple bought one too. Once we get there, we remember that most places only allow one Groupon per table. We ask the server to treat us as two separate tables, and she agrees! Our bill is almost entirely covered by the Groupon. We only owe $6.47 pre-tip. Since the other couple bought the wine, I pay their tip to even it out.  $26.91 9:30 p.m. \u2014 We head to one more spot downtown for another glass of wine. We have a \"passport\" for buy one, get one drinks around town, so we pick a spot where we can utilize it. My boyfriend treats as a way to further even out the spending between the us and our friends, and to celebrate our friends' engagement. The walk home is uphill, and it has gotten colder, but we decide to count this as our exercise and forego taking a Lyft. Once home, we finish the night with a little more wine and this week's  T his is Us . Daily Total: $26.91 Advertisement", "day_four": "Day Four: 10 a.m. \u2014 I am  so  not a morning person. I'd scheduled a cycling class for 10, but I justify missing it. The gym is closing at the end of the month, and I have more classes than I know what to do with. Another morning of french press coffee, job applications, and TV. 12 p.m. \u2014 Breakfast/lunch at home is an english muffin with peanut butter and jelly, and a banana. 3 p.m. \u2014 Haircut at Ulta. I like to go here since I haven't found a standby hairdresser yet in Boulder, and I can earn points at Ulta. My hair is so dry and damaged (thanks, Colorado weather), so I decide to chop it! My mom had nothing nice to say about my hair when I was home for Christmas, so she offered to pay for the cut. It costs $57, and I charge it to a credit card that we share for occasions like this, and send her a selfie to say thanks.  4 p.m. \u2014 Meet up with boyfriend at the Target at the other end of the shopping center. Our cat needs food, and we've been wanting to make some other larger purchases with gift cards from Christmas. We stock up on a lot of cooking supplies. I am able to use a Cartwheel reward to get one piece of bakeware for free! Boyfriend pays the amount not covered by the gift cards, since I've covered the last few trips to Target. 5 p.m. \u2014 Back at Costco, again. We just got the membership for Christmas, so boyfriend needs to get his membership card, and we are in the neighborhood. We decide to open Costco Citi cards while at the membership desk to earn cash back on our Costco purchases. Another real reason we came here is to get a snack before cooking dinner. No sample carts are out, so I get us a hot dog and pop to share. Boyfriend buys himself a few things while I'm at the food counter.  $1.62 6:30 \u2014 Real dinner time. A basic meal of chicken breasts and Brussels sprouts. I also throw together some cookies from a mix while the oven is hot. Boyfriend will bring some to his office tomorrow for a coworker's birthday, and it gives me a chance to use some of my new baking tools.

It is a Monday.  12 p.m. \u2014 I eat the collection of random snacks I brought as a lunch (cup of soup from last week's cafeteria haul, veggie straws, carrots/hummus, Fiber One brownie) while working through lunch. I need to make up some hours that I missed last week. 5:15 p.m. \u2014 I head straight from work to a networking event south of the city. My gas light had gone on on my way to work, so I stop at a gas station on the way down. I pay for gas as needed instead of working it into my budget, since it can really vary depending on how many days I actually work in the office. Since Discover is currently giving 5% Cash Back for gas purchases, I make sure to use my Discover Card.  $27.34 6 p.m. \u2014 I paid $25 to attend this networking event a few weeks back, so appetizers and a glass of wine are \"free!\" I quickly find my friends that are attending, we load up on apps, and order our wine. We all want to meet new people, but it is nice to chat amongst ourselves first. Throughout the night, we divide and conquer a bit, but I don't find anyone with my specific career interests. Still a good experience in meeting new people. 8:15 p.m. \u2014 As I'm driving back home, I see a cop shooting his radar gun at my car. I'm sure I am only going a few miles per hour over the limit, but I know my car stands out and that there is a speed trap on the highway. Rats! He signals for me to pull over, and I tell him that I was sure I was only going 5 m.p.h. over. After checking my ID and insurance, he lets me go with a warning. I did not want to have to pay a ticket. Luck works in my favor today. 9 p.m. \u2014 I'm a little startled when I get home, so I decompress and eventually realize I'm still hungry. I just snack on a few more appetizer-y foods (carrots and hummus again, snap pea crisps) and call it dinner.

I'm really trying to resist the urge to dine out, since I did so much of that over the holidays and in early January. Boyfriend brought my favorite soup home from his work cafeteria yesterday \u2014 carrot ginger. The microwave is super far from my office, so I keep putting off heating it up and get by on snacks. 4 p.m. \u2014 So hungry, but it feels too late to make my soup. Luckily, a meeting in the conference room left some chips behind, so I grab some to hold me over. 6:20 p.m. \u2014 I get home a bit late, still without having eaten a proper lunch. Boyfriend is working late tonight screening a movie. These events always have extra pizza,. I have a few snacks while I wait for him to get home, and pizza is served shortly after. 8:50 p.m. \u2014 As I'm cleaning out my inbox, I remember that my cousin emailed out an order form for her daughter's Girl Scout cookie sales. I was a Girl Scout through high school, and love this time of year. They will visit in a few months and bring the cookies with them. I order five boxes.

I can't believe I've made it the whole week without stopping at Starbucks, but today might have to be the day. We're out of half and half, so my coffee is black and \"bleh.\"  11:45 a.m. \u2014 Already hungry for lunch \u2014 I finally heat up yesterday's soup, and it is delicious but not as filling as I'd like. I have a couple snacks to help hold me over. 4:15 p.m. \u2014 I left work a bit early, since my boss had left the office and I have yet another professional event tonight. I stop in the suburbs for a treat that cannot be found in Boulder: Chick-fil-a. I don't like to frequent this place, but I really have a taste for those little chicken nuggets.  $8.49 4:40 p.m. \u2014 Next to Chick-fil-a is another place that does not exist in Boulder: Walmart! I really do not like to frequent Walmart either, but I have a $10 gift card that I got for signing up for E-bates a couple months back. I grab a couple things I need/want: half and half, Nivea in-shower lotion, and Elf liquid liner. This comes out to $11.70, but I have the gift card!  $1.70 5:30 p.m. \u2014 This professional event is free for me, since I am still considered a \"recent grad.\" It is a Q&A format with some appetizers and networking afterwards. 8 p.m. \u2014 I meet boyfriend for a quick dinner after the event. We are able to make it in to his work cafeteria for a last minute dinner, since I am in the neighborhood. We've taken advantage of this a lot lately since he didn't use many of his meals during the earlier part of the month. It is a great perk when we don't feel like cooking.

I park in a garage where I get a discount with my faculty ID, gather all my things, and head to work. This garage is better for tonight but a longer walk to the office. It's a beautiful, cool morning, so I don't mind the extra distance. 9 a.m. \u2014 At my desk, computer booted, with breakfast: a bowl of cantaloupe I purchased this weekend, a cherry pie Lara Bar (purchased in bulk, thanks to Amazon), and a cup of grapefruit juice. I munch while I check emails and organize my day. 12 p.m. \u2014 Just realized what time it is, and how hungry I am. It's been a productive, fun morning, so I'm ready to take a break. I've brought my lunch today: chicken and apple sausages with spicy brown mustard. I eat some more of my cantaloupe as well. I've been thinking about getting a desk for my condo, so I browse online for one while I eat at my desk. It's an incredibly sunny afternoon, so I don't mind sitting by my window while I live in my slightly antisocial lunch bubble.

I find a cheaper version for about $80, but it's easy to see the difference in quality. I may dwell on this for a while. I had to force myself to stop eating all the cantaloupe I brought, so I can have some for breakfast tomorrow. (It wasn't easy.) 4:30 p.m. \u2014 I am back at my desk after attending a couple of open lectures on campus. Feeling inspired but a little tired, so I have a few pieces of Trader Joe's extra dark chocolate I keep at my desk. They are good, but a bit too bitter for what I'm craving, so I decide to visit Starbucks instead. I reload my card on my app and get a tall chai latte with a shot of vanilla and a peanut butter cup cookie. I also finish up my word search puzzle on my desk daily calendar.  $15 5:15 p.m. \u2014 I'm off to yoga. I bought a package last week that was discounted, since it's done through the college I work for. It's once a week, and today is the first day. 6:30 p.m. \u2014 Yoga is great, but makes me so aware of how much I need to start running and working out again. I get in my car and head towards home.  $7 7 p.m. \u2014 I probably don't need to, but I go to Trader Joe's since it's on the way home to pick up extra food for the week. I am not that hungry, so I'll make something to bring for lunch tomorrow and have some extra goodies for later this week and next.

Daily Total: $74.43", "day_five": "Day Five: 10 a.m. \u2014 Saturday! Hooray! I'm up and out the door with the kitty. The boyfriend is going to his parents' for the rest of the day to help them with some projects, and then he is going off to a job the next day for work. We say our goodbyes. I'm rushing to get home because I'm selling a bookcase and need to meet with the buyer by 11. 11:15 a.m. \u2014 Bookcase sold! I've made an extra $100. I get home, realize that I still feel off from the night before, but also super hungry. I have a steak that's waiting to be cooked, and despite it feeling a bit indulgent for a pre-noon lunch, I cook it. It's delicious, and I'm in a food coma on the sofa. I know I should eat something green, but I'm just not in the mood. Instead I eat far too much coconut milk chocolate ice cream from Trader Joe's. I zone out to  Forensic Files  on Netflix and take an unanticipated nap. 4 p.m. \u2014 Whoops. That was a much longer nap than anticipated... I feel crummy and decide to redo my nails and drink tons of water. My gel nails lasted barely a week, so the refresh looks great. While they are drying, a good friend texts me to let me know she and her boyfriend are hanging out. I've yet to meet her beau, so I commit to come spend some time with them to get to know him. Advertisement 6:30 p.m. \u2014 Hanging out with my friend and her boyfriend at her place. I feel better after chugging lots of water, so I decline when she offers me a drink. They have another party to get to, so I don't visit too long. 8 p.m. \u2014 It still feels early, so I meet up with a friend in the area. We end up going to a wine and cheese bar and have some girl time. We order a bottle of wine, hummus and pita, and bread with olive oil. We split the bill down the middle.  $23.45 11:30 p.m. \u2014 So tired. My cat curls up at the foot of the bed, and I'm out within minutes.

I have a breakfast pastry that I got from Trader Joe's earlier in the week, with a cup of tea. 11:30 a.m. \u2014 My friend from the night before is in my area running errands, so we meet up after to go shopping; she's still looking for flats, and I'm trying to find dresses to wear for work. Instead I find some cute, comfortable heels and very versatile tops from White House Black Market. I also decide to get some Sperry boat shoes since spring is here, and I'm sure more boat trips are in the future.  $218.36 2:30 p.m. \u2014 Home. Hungry. I spent more than anticipated today, so I eat in. I really want a salad, but the lettuce I have appears to have gone bad. I settle on some falafel patties from Trader Joe's and cook some fresh broccoli. Advertisement 8:30 p.m. \u2014 Where did my evening go? I haven't had dinner, so I munch on some blue chips and black bean hummus. 9:30 p.m. \u2014 I'm actually feeling really drained from being so inactive, so I decide to head to bed and read.

I decide to clean up this morning since I was a bit of a sloth yesterday. I feed the kitty and make a ginger green tea for myself. I'm debating wearing my new heels today, which really dictates my outfit since they are bright fuchsia. 8:50 a.m. \u2014 Since I'm apparently not stressing about getting ready this morning, I drive to work to make sure I get in by 9 a.m. A coworker has already commented on my shoes. I'm glad I wore them...for now. 9:15 a.m. \u2014 Breakfast includes a cherry pie Lara Bar. (Is it obvious that I live off of these? They are my favorite.) 11:30 p.m. \u2014 I decide to risk walking to Verde for lunch today. I find my stash of random stamped cards from the past few months, and I have enough to redeem my free salad! I get the Mesa Verde (light on onions and tomatoes) with the agave mustard dressing. It's my favorite. 12:30 p.m. \u2014 I grab a tall coconut milk latte from Starbucks using my app. I'll need to refill it soon, but if tracking my spending for work has shown me anything, it's that I go to Starbucks a  lot . I'm helping out a different department today, so I know I'll be busy until it's time to leave for the day. (Also: Still going strong in the shoes.) Advertisement 5:30 p.m. \u2014 Pay for parking and fight the traffic home. I'm feeling the shoes now.  $7 6:30 p.m. \u2014 Traffic is a beast. As soon as I'm home, I kick off my heels. They weren't too bad; I've just gotten out of the habit of wearing heels all day. I put on comfy slippers and get dinner ready for the kitty and myself. I have some beef from Trader Joe's, so I warm that up in a pan, and cook up some broccoli as well. I also decide to make some coconut rice from TJ's. 8 p.m. \u2014 Wearing heels all day has made my feet ache a little, so I decide to stretch them out with a walk. I text the boyfriend while he's away. Texting is so much easier for both of us, since he can be anywhere when he's on a job and may not be able to talk. 9 p.m. \u2014 Feeling a bit refreshed and sweaty from my walk, so I jump in the shower. I decide to avoid sitting in front of the TV and crawl into bed with a book. The cat decides to join me at the foot of the bed. This is a recent change in his behavior, and I LOVE IT. Cats aren't very good for forced cuddle time, so his proximity is very welcome. 11 p.m. \u2014 I'm having a hard time falling asleep despite my eyes feeling heavy from reading. I make a cup of Sleepytime tea and do what I call \"yoga breathing\" in bed. Advertisement Daily Total: $7", "url": "https://www.refinery29.com/money-diary-charleston-sc-librarian-faculty-budget"},

Eat a couple of pieces of Hershey's chocolate left over from Valentine's Day. 12:10 p.m. \u2014 Fianc\u00e9 wakes up, so I make him coffee and throw together a simple breakfast (brunch?) using some garlic baguette and brie that we picked up at the store yesterday. I slice up some hard-boiled eggs we have in the fridge and serve those as well. 2 p.m. \u2014 After chatting for a bit, we pull ourselves together and go out to run some errands. We are out of olive oil, and I need to refill my bus card. We walk to the bus station, and I refill my card ($57.25, included in monthly expenses above). It's unseasonably warm, so we decide to walk the 20-some blocks to our favorite local grocery instead of taking the train. On our way to the store, we pass Duane Reade, and I remember that I am on my last drops of foundation, and my fianc\u00e9 needs his face wash. We pop into Duane Reade and decide against the purchase as everything we need could be purchased cheaper on Amazon. We walk by a Dunkin' Donuts on our way to the store, and I pop in for a medium coffee.  $2.50 Advertisement 2:30 p.m. \u2014 At the store, we pick up five liters of olive oil (an essential in our house, and it will last for a long while). My fianc\u00e9 notices that they stocked the Moroccan flatbread that I like, so he grabs two pieces for me. Hummus is on sale, two for $7, so we grab two. The total is $49.99, but my fianc\u00e9 pays for the groceries today, since I spent about $100 yesterday on food (an enormous wheel of brie, edam, bread, Greek yogurt, avocados, grapes, clementines, frozen pierogies, chicken dumplings, sour cream, cold crab salad, and a few baked goods). 3:15 p.m. \u2014 While walking back home, we notice that Modell's is having a sidewalk sale. I've been needing a new pair of supportive running shoes for a while; I twisted my ankle last year and can still feel the injury when I'm on the treadmill. On a whim, we decide to go in, and I take stock of the sneakers. The salesgirl recommends a pair of Nikes to me, which feel like heaven on the feet and are on sale. I decide to purchase them using a $100 gift card I received from the president of my company at Christmas and have been saving for a big purchase. The total is $89.90, so it's covered by the card. While I'm at it, I stop at the T.J. Maxx across the street and buy two six-packs of athletic socks. I use the rest of the card and end up paying the remainder.  $5.97 Advertisement 4 p.m. \u2014 Back home, and I have to do some laundry. I refill our laundry card and throw two loads in the wash. While my fianc\u00e9 chats with his family back home, I do some food prep for the week. I cook a lot during the week for myself, but I like to prepare meals for my fianc\u00e9 to take with him to work or come home to, since he comes home super late, and him banging around the kitchen to cook would wake me up (also, one can only eat so much chicken over rice). This week, I put together chicken and avocado wraps with chili-lime salsa, and falafel-tomato-hummus wraps, which I stick in the freezer.  $10 6:30 p.m. \u2014 We are getting hungry, so I boil and saut\u00e9e some of the pierogies and chicken dumplings we purchased yesterday.

I do freelance paralegal-type work for my former boss in my off hours. She sends me small projects a couple times a week and pays me $16/hour. I bill her monthly, but the amount I receive is highly variable based on how many projects I work on in a given month. I am using 100% of the money I earn in this role for wedding savings. She emails back and promises to pay me tomorrow. Advertisement 1:30 p.m. \u2014 I remember that I need to purchase our beauty supplies so I log into Amazon and check if Ebates has any cash-back deals for Amazon. I start a shopping trip in Ebates and add my foundation ($5.99) and my toner ($13.30) to my Amazon cart. I browse for my fianc\u00e9's Neutrogena face wash and notice that it would cost $9.69 for one bottle or $19.17 for three. It's a better deal to get multiple, so I add the three to my cart ($19.17). On a semi-whim, I add a bouquet of pink silk (faux) peonies that I'd been eyeing to the cart as well ($13.99). I love having plants and fresh flowers around the apartment, but since we get so little natural light in our place, all our real plants have died. I feel a little guilty after the purchase, but my foundation and toner will last me at least two months.  $52.45 2:30 p.m. \u2014 The afternoon slump sets in, so I bother my coworker for a cup of her ultra-caffeinated green tea, which our other coworker brings to us from China. I strain the tea while chatting with my coworkers. 4:15 p.m. \u2014 On the bus to go home. The tea did nothing for me, and I nearly fall asleep while listening to my podcasts. 5:15 p.m. \u2014 I'm home, but can't muster enough energy to go to the gym, even though I'm excited to try out my new sneakers. I munch on a few leftover pierogies while preparing a falafel wrap, since the green tea upset my stomach. Advertisement 5:30 p.m. \u2014 After I eat, I turn on Netflix and put on a sheet mask. I'm really into Korean skincare and try to do a mask at least twice a week. They do wonders for my skin. 9 p.m. \u2014 Trying to wind down and am tired from not sleeping enough last night.

Any excitement I have dissipates as I transfer $950 to my fianc\u00e9's account (my portion of the rent, plus my portion of the utilities, plus parking; I am paying the full $250 for parking this month since things are a bit tight for my fianc\u00e9. He's self-employed, so he just paid his yearly taxes and also just returned from a trip back to his home country to see his parents and sick brother.) I transfer $150 to savings. Being an adult is boring. 7:30 a.m. \u2014 I don't usually carry a credit card balance, but we recently purchased plane tickets to go visit my fianc\u00e9's home country in August, and I bought one for my mom too. She was a single mom for most of her young life, and never had the chance to travel or do anything for herself, so I try to spoil her when I can. Because of the credit card payment, I'm putting less into savings this month in an attempt to pay down the balance ASAP. I also put the purchase of my fianc\u00e9's ticket on my credit card to take advantage of cash-back reward points, but he will pay me back for his ticket and part of my mom's. Advertisement 1:15 p.m. \u2014 I grab a cheese stick from the office kitchen. I don't usually eat much during the work day, and I have dinner at home when I'm back from work and the gym. This is an unhealthy habit, which I'm trying to break, since I know it's not good to calorie-load at the end of the day. My coworker returns from her break and tells me it's beautiful outside, so I step out for my lunch break and take a stroll in Central Park. 2 p.m. \u2014 Back in the office and feeling bleh. My coworker in the cube next to me made a chai latte with the Keurig so I take some inspiration from her and make a dirty chai using our office espresso machine, the Keurig, and some half and half. 3:40 p.m. \u2014 Skip out 20 minutes early today since I have a dentist appointment. Luckily, the dentist is right down the street from me, so I don't have to go far. 4 p.m. \u2014 No copay at the dentist for my semi-annual cleaning. I am so thankful for health insurance. 4:40 p.m. \u2014 My teeth are sparkly and clean and I hop on the bus to go home 6:30 p.m. \u2014 I  finally  get off the bus (traffic was dreadful) and am too annoyed/discouraged by how long it took me to get home to muster any energy for the gym. My cat is meowing and guilt-tripping me when I walk through the door, which seals the deal. I jazz up an instant noodle with some frozen veggies, chicken sausage, and an egg.

At work, I brew a pot of coffee and prepare myself for an insane day. 10:25 a.m. \u2014 Boss wants blueberry muffins, so I am on the hunt, in the rain. Grab a half dozen at a local deli; I pay $13.50 using petty cash from the office. 11:45 a.m. \u2014 Starving and realize I haven't eaten yet today, so I sneak half of a muffin from the kitchen. It turns out NOT to be blueberry, but instead chocolate chip. No complaints there. 12:35 p.m. \u2014 My office manager is ordering us salads for lunch since we're all swamped and can't leave today (this is unusual and happens only once every few months or so; as junior staff, our meals usually can't be expensed). I order an Asian chicken salad ($18.75, expensed) and eat at my desk. Hopefully this will give me energy to go to the gym later.

While it's in the oven, I call and chat with my parents. 9 p.m. \u2014 I'm just getting into bed when my fianc\u00e9 calls me, and we talk on the phone for half an hour while he's on break. I wanted to go to sleep early, since I know tomorrow is going to be another crazy day, but it feels nice to chat with him.

I use the Greek yogurt hair mask that I bought earlier this week, and my hair feels super soft afterward. 4 p.m. \u2014 I put on my makeup and try to decide what to wear. I'm meeting up with my friend/coworker for dinner, and then we're going to see a live performance of a podcast we're both really into. We purchased the tickets, which were $40 each, a few months ago. I get dressed and spritz on the perfume I'm sampling. It's wonderful. 4:55 p.m. \u2014 My fianc\u00e9 tells me I smell great! He is a bit bummed that I am going out and he doesn't have plans, so as a consolation I offer to order him dinner off Seamless. He says he'll think about it, but he feels guilty about me spending money on him. I think he deserves it; he works so hard and doesn't really do anything fun for himself, ever. I kiss him goodbye and am out the door. 5:20 p.m. \u2014 I'm outside in the freezing wind, and the bus is 10 minutes late!

Ha! 5:45 p.m. \u2014 Transfer to the red-line train, which of course is running local today due to construction. My friend texts and says she called the restaurant, and they're holding our table for us. 6:27 p.m. \u2014 I finally reach my stop and bound out of the station. I make it to the restaurant in time to keep our table, and my friend walks in a minute after me. 6:40 p.m. \u2014 It's a sampling restaurant, so we order three plates to share: eggplant, gnocchi, and a caprese salad. Delicious. She orders two glasses of wine over the course of the meal, but I don't drink often, so I abstain. Red wine would make me sleepy, anyway. 7:30 p.m. \u2014 The show starts at 8, so we decide we better get going. The check is $77, and we leave a $16 tip.

I usually give myself license to eat as much as I want between the hours of 9 to 5 under the guide of \u201cintermittent fasting\u201d even though I'm fairly sure that's not how it works. 5:15 \u2014 I leave \"early\" to drive to my therapists' office. I'm taking March off alcohol, so I spend most of the time bragging about how good I feel. My therapist probably scrawls \u201cWhite lady seems to be momentarily over her first world problems\u201d in her notebook after I leave.  $20 (from FSA account) Daily Total: $20", "day_two": "Day Two: 9:00 a.m. \u2014 I use Southwest points to book a trip to Puerto Rico and pay $76 in fees. I'm secretly starting to get into travel hacking, which is a loathsome term for loathsome people, but I am becoming one of them.  $76 5:30 p.m. \u2014 This is doctor week: I pony up $40 for a dermatologist co-pay (from my FSA) and $11 for parking. I have been meaning to get my skin checked out for a while, so addressing it feels good.  $51 8 p.m. \u2014 I purchase a ClassPass promotion they're having all month. I recently broke up with my fancy yoga studio and have been deal-hopping on Groupons like a total jerk. Regular weekly exercise keeps me from becoming a depressive alcoholic, so it's worth the money, even when I'm paying full price.  $30 Advertisement Daily Total: $157", "day_three": "Day Three: 3 p.m. \u2014 I pony up to replace an appliance part that broke while I was in an old apartment. It's technically the landlord's responsibility but he sucks and I don't want my old roommates to remember me as a jerk, so it's on me.  $70 5:30 p.m. \u2014 I stop at the post office and throw down for international stamps to send Christmas letters to pals in Berlin and Australia.  $7 7 p.m. \u2014 I stop at Jo-Ann's and buy yarn and knitting needles to keep my sober hands busy. I watch some YouTube videos and clumsily knit a few rows. My cat bats at the yarn ball and I praise her for her brilliance.  $13 Daily Total: $90", "day_four": "Day Four: 10 a.m. \u2014 I receive a call from my pharmacy; the special skin cream prescribed by the derm is experimental and not covered by insurance. I pay for the cream out of my FSA and put $5 on a credit card for shipping.  $89 7 p.m. \u2014 I go to a spin class via ClassPass after work and it's really really hard, but I feel very proud of myself afterwards. The screen in front shows our ranking: It turns out I'm a competitive maniac who will probably end up near the top but entirely alone. 9 p.m. \u2014 I get home and buy two books I'll probably never read on Amazon. They'll actually ship the next day.  $15 Daily Total: $104", "day_five": "Day Five: Advertisement 7:45 a.m. \u2014 Coffee at work. Today's food struggle involves testing burgers. I'm in heaven. I'm also very, very full. 2 p.m. \u2014 I book the Puerto Rico rental car because my boyfriend used his points on my return flight. I don't live with him, I'm pretty sure I out-earn him, and he is unbearably frugal in a \"don't turn up the thermostat \u2014 just hands me a third sweater\" kind of way. My prince!  $172 7 p.m. \u2014 I fill up my car with gas. I only do this once a month, since I drive my car little old lady style to work, home, and therapy. I usually try to buy gas in the suburbs, since gas is cheaper there than in the city, but I missed my chance on Monday.  $29 Daily Total: $201", "day_six": "Day Six: 11 a.m. \u2014 Day off! A yoga studio I've gone to a few times has a free community class on Saturdays, so I try to make it as often as possible to stretch out my ClassPass. I donate $2 which I know makes me seem miserly, but they don't really solicit anything! I'm the only one who donates, I notice.  $2 6 p.m. \u2014 I go to a friend's house for dinner and she's made chili. I contribute a bouquet of fresh flowers for $9, since I'm not bringing any alcohol. I take the train there and back on my Ventra card.  $9 11 p.m. \u2014 I meet up with my friends at a bar and am charged $1 for seltzer water. I'm energized from my nap and walk the half hour there and back, in an unseasonably warm winter.  $1 Advertisement Daily Total: $12", "day_seven": "Day Seven: 12 p.m. \u2014 Laundry day! I secretly love this chore. Sorting and hang-drying and turning things inside out and folding are very soothing, and having a clean stack of clothes is so satisfying. I pay $7 for two huge washers (drying is free dryers) \u2014 and then $4 for a ginormous scoop of peanut butter chocolate ice cream at the joint next door to the laundromat.  $11 4 p.m. \u2014 I attend my first barre class via ClassPass, and I'm not sure it's for me. I should probably give it another shot, but I feel kind of dumb sitting against the wall pressing a tiny red rubber ball into a pole. There was a moment when I made eye contact with my reflection and wondered what my purpose was on this earth. Barre feels dated to me already, like Jazzercise or NordicTrack. 6 p.m. \u2014 I pick up two pairs of clean, re-soled shoes from the cobbler and bleed out more money. This is about what they cost new, but neither pair is being made anymore and they were in bad shape after the winter. I pat myself on the back for not throwing them in a landfill, but the price tag still stings.  $110 Daily Total: $121 Editors' Note: This post has been updated from the original.", "url": "https://www.refinery29.com/money-diary-midwest-city-project-manager-budget"}
